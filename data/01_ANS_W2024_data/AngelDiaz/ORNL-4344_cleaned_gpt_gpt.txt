The objective of the Molten-Salt Reactor Program is the development of nuclear reactors which use fluid fuels that are solutions of fissile and fertile materials in suitable carrier salts. The program is an outgrowth of the effort begun over 18 years ago in the Aircraft Nuclear Propulsion (ANP) program to make a molten-salt reactor power plant for aircraft.

Our major goal now is to achieve a thermal breeder reactor that will produce power at low cost while simultaneously conserving and extending the nation's fuel resources. Fuel for this type of reactor would be 33UF6 or 35UF6 dissolved in a salt that is a mixture of LiF and BeF2. The fertile material would be ThF4 dissolved in the same salt or in a separate blanket salt of similar composition. The technology being developed for the breeder is also applicable to an advanced converter.

A major program activity is the operation of the Molten-Salt Reactor Experiment (MSRE). This reactor was built to test the types of fuels and materials that would be used in thermal breeder and converter reactors and to provide experience with. The initial fuel contains 0.9 mole % UF6, 5 mole % ZF, 29 mole % BeF2, and 65 mole % LiF, and the uranium is about 2% 235U. The melting point.

Design of the MSRE started early in the summer of 1960, and fabrication of equipment began early in 1962. The essential installations were completed, and pre-nuclear testing was begun in August of 1964. After additional modifications, maintenance, and sealing of the containment, operation at a power of 1 MW began in January 1966.

At the 1-MW power level, trouble was experienced with plugging of small ports in control valves in the off-gas system by heavy liquid and varnish-like organic materials. These materials are believed to be produced by radiation polymerization of a very small amount of oil that vaporizes after leaking through a gasketed seal into the tank of the fuel circulating pump. This difficulty was overcome by installing a specially designed filter in.

Full power, about 8.0 MW, was reached in May 1966; and the plant was operated at full power for about six weeks. Then, one of the radiator cooling blowers (which were left over from the ANP program) broke from mechanical stress. While new blowers were being procured, an array of graphite and metal surveillance specimens was taken from the core and examined.

After a shutdown to remove salt that had accidentally gotten into an off-gas line, the MSRE was operated in December and January at full power for 30 days without interruption. The next power run was begun later in January and was continued for 102 days until terminated to remove a second set of graphite and metal specimens. An additional operating period of 46 days during the summer was interrupted for maintenance work on the sampler-enricher when the cable drive mechanism jammed.

In September 1967, a run was begun which continued for six months until terminated on schedule in March 1968. Power operation during this run had to be interrupted once when the reactor was taken to zero power to repair an electrical short.

Completion of this six-month run brought to a close the first phase of MSRE operation, in which the objective was to demonstrate on a small scale the attractive features and technical feasibility of these systems for civilian power reactors. We believe this objective has been achieved and that the MSRE has shown that molten fluoride reactors can be operated at temperatures above 1200°F without corrosive attack on either the metal or graphite parts of the system, that the fuel is completely stable, that reactor equipment can operate satisfactorily at these conditions, that xenon can be removed rapidly from molten salts, and that, when necessary, the radioactive equipment can be repaired or replaced.

The second phase of MSRE operation began in August 1968 when a small facility in the MSRE building was used to remove the original uranium charge from the fuel salt by treatment with gaseous F2. In six days of fluorination, 219 kg of uranium was removed from the molten salt and loaded onto absorbers filled with sodium fluoride pellets. The decontamination and recovery of the uranium were.

A large part of the Molten-Salt Reactor Program is now being devoted to the requirements of future molten-salt reactors. Conceptual design studies are being made of large breeder reactors, and an increasing amount of work on materials, on the chemistry of fuel and coolant salts, and on processing methods is included in the research and development program.

For several years, most of our work on breeder reactors was aimed specifically at two-fluid systems in which graphite tubes would be used to separate uranium-bearing fuel salts from thorium-bearing fertile salts. We think attractive reactors.

Of this type can be developed, but several years of experience with a prototype reactor would be required to prove that graphite can serve as a plumbing material while exposed to high fast-neutron irradiations. As a consequence, a one-fluid breeder has been a long-sought goal.

Two developments of the past year established the feasibility of a one-fluid breeder. The first was the demonstration of the chemical steps in a process which uses liquid bismuth to extract protactinium and uranium selectively from a salt that also contains thorium. The second was the recognition that a fertile blanket can be obtained with a salt that contains uranium and thorium by reducing the graphite-to-fuel ratio in the outer part of the core. Our studies show that a one-fluid, two-region breeder can be built that has fuel utilization characteristics approaching those of our two-fluid designs, and probably better economics. Since the graphite serves only as a moderator, the one-fluid reactor is more nearly a scale-up of the MSRE.

Run 14, which began in September 1967, was terminated as scheduled on March 26. Fuel salt had been in the core continuously for 188 days, and the reactor had been critical 98% of the time. Shutdown was for the purpose of removing specimens from the core, investigating fission product retention in the fuel salt and off-gas systems, performing some maintenance, and stripping the uranium from the salt in preparation for addition.

Two weeks before the end of the run, the fuel sampler-enricher cable had become tangled. After the fuel was drained, the manipulator was used to untangle the cable, but in the process, the sample capsule and key were dropped into the pump bowl. Tests in a mockup showed permanent magnets to be a most effective retrieval device, but efforts in the pump bowl were not successful. The corroded top of a capsule dropped eight months earlier was recovered, but the other capsule was apparently lodged irretrievably. Later tests showed that samples could still be obtained.

Shakedown tests of the fluorine disposal system plant led to the abandonment of the original SO2F2 gaseous reaction system in favor of the reaction of fluorine with a caustic solution. Work with this system delayed salt processing until August 1. Once started, processing went rapidly.

Laboratory measurements of coolant salt heat capacity cleared up discrepancies between air and salt heat balances at the MSRE; the maximum power is 8.0 MW rather than the 7.2 MW indicated earlier by salt heat balances. Revision of burnup and other terms in the reactivity balance resulted in the net change in the residual term being only 0.2% Δk/k in 72,000 MWh of operation with 755 tests. Tests showed that the dynamics characteristics had not changed during that time. Random noise in the neutron flux correlated with a circulating bubble fraction of about 0.1 vol%.

Operation of the freeze-flange thermal-cycle test was continued through 268 cycles, after which it was shut down for inspection of the flanges. Inspection with dye penetrant showed indications of fatigue failure only in the bore region of the male flange where the alignment stub is welded to the face of the flange. The containment integrity of the joint was not affected.

Three of fifteen new relays in the rod scram coincidence matrix failed due to stuck contacts within four months of installation. Another fission chamber was replaced. The average service of these chambers is proving to be about three months. Simulator tests showed the rod control system to be adequate for 7% operation.

The correction factor for delayed neutron effectiveness, which accounts for differences in emission energies, was recalculated after an improved model for determining the difference in average age to thermal energies between prompt and delayed neutrons became available. 086, about 5% higher than earlier calculations had given. This has the effect of increasing the rod worth measured by reactor periods and the values of reactivity coefficients that were measured relative to the rod worth.

The transient time response and the frequency response of the reactor to reactivity perturbations were calculated using characteristics of the system with 735 fuel. Stability analyses using several techniques showed that the system will be stable at all power levels and that the degree of stability will increase with increasing power.

The design study of a single-fluid MSBR power station was continued, but with the plant capacity changed to 1000 MW (electrical) to be consistent with current design studies of other reactors. The shape and arrangement of the graphite elements in the core were changed to provide an undermoderated "blanket region" at the top and sides of the core to conserve neutrons. This blanket space at the sides is filled with 4-inch diameter.

For the periodic replacement of graphite, it was decided to remove the entire core as an assembly rather than to move a few graphite elements at a time. This change made it possible to eliminate a grid formerly used to space the graphite pieces in the core. The graphite is now contained in a Hastelloy N basket, in which the moderator can be preassembled and attached to a spare top reactor vessel head to allow the core substitution to be made more quickly. The maintenance equipment required for graphite replacement received preliminary study and appears to be feasible.

A new flowsheet was prepared to show revised flow rates and to include some of the auxiliary systems, such as the drain tank heat rejection system, the off-gas systems, etc. A freeze valve will be used on the primary system drain line. Provisions will be made upstream of the valve for circulating the salt to avoid overheating; the drain line will be drained downstream of the valve. A catch basin has been provided beneath the reactor system to collect any primary salt spilled in an accident and to direct it to the primary drain tank through a bismuth seal in a U-trap. This arrangement would prevent spilled secondary salt from entering the primary.

A new reactor optimization code, ROD, was developed to replace OPTIMERC. The principal improvements incorporated in the new code include: (1) multiple thermal-neutron groups, (2) the capability of using different spectrum-averaged cross sections of a particular nuclide in different regions of the reactor, and (3) a better calculation of two-dimensional neutronic effects by synthesizing two.

A constrained optimization calculation of the one-fluid MSBR was performed with ROD utilizing the improvements described above. Basically, a two-region reactor was considered. Processing rates were fixed. With these restrictions, all salt volume fractions and reactor dimensions were optimized with respect to annual fuel yield. The results of the calculation indicate that a breeding ratio of 1. 07, an annual fuel yield of 4%, and a graphite lifetime of 1. 8 years (without power flattening) are achievable with this reactor.

Survey calculations were performed on a single-fluid core moderated with graphite balls rather than prismatic elements. The maximum annual fuel yield achievable with a randomly packed bed of graphite balls is less than 2%. The inventory charges are typically 0.3 to 0.4 mil/kWh (electrical), and the graphite lifetime is around three years.

Some preliminary calculations indicate that the peak damage flux and power density of a large MSBR and a breeding ratio greater than unity with 0% U fuel can be achieved in a breeder experiment that would operate at a power level less than 200 MW (thermal).

The volumetric throughput of the helium in the gas system is reduced. It was found that the bubbles could recirculate ten times before they must be removed because of an approach to saturation. Because of the uncertainty in some of the parameters governing the efficiency of removal of Xe by the use of circulating bubbles, it may be necessary to plan on coating the graphite so that the target Xe poison fraction can be achieved. The method for generating the bubbles has moved toward a fluid-powered generator where the gas is injected through small holes in the throat of a venturi. The bubbles are to be removed by a pipeline separator, which uses a swirl generator to produce a high gravitational field and a gas-filled vortex to which the bubbles migrate. A working model using water as the circulation fluid has been operated with flows.

About 950 hours of intermittent circulating time were accumulated before draining the flushing charge of salt from the sodium fluoroborate test facility. The loop is now being operated with a fresh batch of NaBF₄. Head-flow data are in good agreement with prior data for water and NaK. Test values for the minimum pressure necessary to suppress cavitation agreed closely with predicted values for the new batch of salt but were significantly higher than the predicted values in the case of the flushing salt. The difference was ascribed to the impurities in the flushing salt. Operations were interrupted from time to time by gas line restrictions caused by a variety of materials. Analytical investigations are underway to determine the nature and source of each of the materials involved. Several ingassing transients occurred during the performance of the cavitation tests. Pieces of green salt, rich in U and Th, were found when the pump was opened for inspection.

Consideration is being given to using one basic pump design for the MSBR fuel- and coolant-salt pumps because of the similarity in the pumping requirements. Differences in head requirements could be accommodated by modifying the impeller diameter and speed. The test system will contain approximately 200 ft of salt.

The final report on the rotor dynamic feasibility studies for long-shaft pump configurations has been received from Mechanical Technology Incorporated.

An outline of a program to develop steam generators for the Molten-Salt Breeder Experiment was prepared and includes a facility for testing full-scale tubes. The facility will have a heating capacity of up to 3 MW (thermal) at a molten-salt temperature of 1200°F.

The analysis of the dynamic behavior of the molten-salt breeder reactor system was continued, with emphasis on the overall plant control problem. Specific control problems associated with the dynamics of the steam generator as well as the problems of integrated control of the entire heat transfer system from reactor to turbine throttle were investigated. Several basic control schemes were tried, and the results are given. Future studies will include control of the temperature of the primary salt by using reactivity control.

To determine the suitability of a recently marketed high-temperature resistance thermometer for use in precise measurement of temperatures and differential temperatures in molten-salt systems, two sets of thermometers were purchased and are being evaluated. Results of tests to date indicate that the calibration of the thermometers is stable below 1200°F, and that calibration shifts occur above 1200°F, increasing in magnitude with increasing temperature. Attempts to stabilize the thermometers and restore the original calibration by extended operation at temperatures less than 1500°F were much less effective.

Heat transfer is a fundamental aspect of thermodynamics that governs the flow of thermal energy between systems. It plays a crucial role in various physical phenomena, including conduction, convection, and radiation. Understanding the physical properties of materials is essential for predicting and analyzing heat transfer processes. These properties, such as thermal conductivity, specific heat capacity, and density, dictate how materials respond to changes in temperature and influence the overall heat transfer characteristics of a system.

Heat Transfer. An apparatus for studying the heat transfer characteristics of molten salts was assembled. In this system, the salt is induced to flow through an electrically heated small-diameter tube by applying gas pressure alternately to salt reservoirs located at each end of the test section. Initial experiments were conducted with the Reynolds moduli between 700 and 20,000, heat fluxes from 3 x 10^4 to 6 x 10^6 Btu hr/ft^2, and mean fluid temperatures between 1230 and 1510°F. Wall-temperature patterns were unexpectedly different from those observed in earlier studies with molten salts. In the laminar flow regime, the heat transfer was in reasonable agreement with accepted empirical correlation.

Thermophysical Properties. A variable-gap apparatus was used to obtain preliminary values for the thermal conductivities of three molten fluoride mixtures. For the MSRE coolant (LiF BeF2, 66-34 mole %), the conductivity fell in the range 0.010 to 0.012 W cm-1°C-1.

Returned to 0.012 W/cm (°C) at 900°C. Despite difficulties with BF, loss, and thermocouple lead wire inhomogeneities, the total scatter for three sets of measurements with a proposed MSBR coolant (NaF-NaBF4, 8-92 mole %) was less than +13%. The conductivity was found to decrease nearly linearly from 0.0053 to 0.0039 W/cm (°C) between 400 and 800°C. Although the apparatus being used was designed to minimize errors in measurements with salts having conductivities in the range 0.05 to 0.10 W/cm (°C) — an order of magnitude above the conductivities of the salts currently under study — corrected data should ultimately have an uncertainty of less than +15%. A planned new apparatus should result in further improved accuracy.

Methods for predicting the thermal conductivities of molten-salt mixtures were surveyed, and estimated values were compared with experimental results. It was found that the equation developed by Rao yielded conductivities that were in excellent agreement with the chloride and nitrate data but were only adequate for fluoride mixtures. Several possible reasons for this latter discrepancy were that (1) the theory was based on single-component liquids and (2) the fluoride mixture data still contain large uncertainties.

Mass Transfer to Circulating Bubbles. A proposed scheme for removing fission product gases from MSBR fuel salts involves stripping 135Xe in the region outside the reactor core with co-circulating small helium bubbles. An experiment to provide initial data for establishing the feasibility of this technique is in an advanced stage of design. Helium bubbles will be used to remove dissolved oxygen (simulating Xe) from room-temperature glycerol-water solutions (simulating molten salt). This system possesses dynamic similarity with presently conceived MSBR designs.

The Molten Salt Reactor Experiment (MSRE) was a pioneering nuclear reactor experiment that operated at the Oak Ridge National Laboratory in the 1960s. The chemistry of the MSRE was a crucial aspect of its design and operation. One key feature was the use of a liquid fuel mixture consisting of fluoride salts of uranium, plutonium, and thorium. This liquid fuel enabled efficient heat transfer and facilitated online reprocessing, allowing the removal of fission products while the reactor was still in operation. The high-temperature molten salt environment posed challenges for materials used in the reactor, requiring careful selection and testing to mitigate corrosion issues. Additionally, the presence of radioactive isotopes in the fuel mixture necessitated strict protocols for handling and processing to ensure the safety of personnel and the integrity of the reactor system.

Chemical analyses of the MSRE fuel and coolant salts continued to show that the chemical stability of these salts in use is excellent; that generalized corrosion of the MSRE containment system was negligible during the current report period and that analytical chemical methods were effective in confirming nuclear performance. The previous disparity noted between nominal values of uranium in the fuel salt and those obtained by chemical analysis was resolved by new and higher values for the heat capacity of the coolant salt. Recomputed values for the nominal concentrations of uranium now fall within +0.1% of chemical values.

The feasibility of starting molten-salt reactors with plutonium trifluoride was evaluated. Compatibility in such reactors is moderately well assured but requires confirmation of the solubility of PuF3 and oxide tolerance before tests can be made using the MSRE.

The fate of fission products in the MSRE was further explored by the study of a third set of graphite and Hastelloy N long-term surveillance specimens obtained after the March 25, 1968, shutdown. Three of the CGB graphite specimens had been exposed to 64,000 MWhr, as was true of the other nine graphite specimens. Surprisingly, the doubly exposed graphite did not receive any heavier deposition of long-lived nuclides like 102Ru than the singly exposed. Although the concentration profiles for fission products were different for the four kinds of graphite studied, there was surprisingly little difference in the total deposition per unit area. The outer portion of the graphite was partially permeated by the fission products. The deposition on metal was lower than previously encountered by a factor of about 3.

Men confirmed the results obtained by milled samples. An analysis of surveillance specimens for Li and F indicated that fuel salt, in minute amounts, permeated far into the graphite. Because some of the fission products behaved as though they were dispersed colloidal, a study of the behavior of colloids in molten salts was.

In continuing evaluations of alkali fluoroborates as secondary coolants in molten-salt reactors, studies of the NaF-KF-BF phase equilibria examined the ideality of solution behavior. The possibility that hydroxyfluoroborates play a significant role as contaminants in fluoroborate melts has led to efforts to synthesize and characterize the pure phases. The structure of crystalline NaBF was shown to consist of slightly irregular BF tetrahedra. The sodium ions are coordinated by eight fluoride ions which are at the corners of an irregular polyhedron. Thermochemical data were obtained for NaBF, KBF2, and KF-KBF4 mixtures. Densities of the possible coolant salt mixture NaF-NaBF4 (8-92 mole%) were measured for the temperature range 439 to 508°C and are given by the equation.

Refined values for the solubility of thorium metal in molten LiF-ThF2 mixtures were obtained, which are slightly lower; that is, between 0.3 and 1.0 mole % at 620°C, than previously reported. Evidence for a solid of the alleged formula ThOF was examined and found to be without merit. The heat content of LiF-BeF2-ThF4 (72-16-12 mole %) was obtained experimentally for the temperature range 25 to 750°C. The electrical conductivities of molten LiF-BeF2 mixtures were determined in relation to temperature characteristics for compositions ranging from 38 to 52 mole % BeF2.

Continued efforts were given to the development of reference electrodes based on Be/Be and Ni-Ni half-cells for use with molten fluorides. Preliminary results, in which stable potentials were achieved for periods of up to 24 hours, indicate the feasibility of developing such electrodes.

In continuing studies of the pressures of SiF in equilibrium with molten Li, BeF2, crystalline Be, SiO2, and SiO2, equilibrium data were obtained for higher BeO/SiO2 ratios than had been measured previously. As a result, the chemistry of silica in LiF-BeF2 melts is now well defined.

Current results of laboratory-scale experiments continue to demonstrate the feasibility of extracting protactinium, uranium, and the rare earths from molten fluoride fuels by reductive methods. Extraction of protactinium at tracer levels from a one-fluid breeder reactor fuel was demonstrated.

Of sample containers. An evaluation of the operating history of the hot-cell apparatus for oxide indicated that electrolytic moisture-monitor cells are desensitized rapidly during the analysis of highly radioactive samples; however, similar desensitization of a test cell could not be produced by exposure to radioactivity of comparable and higher levels. All current and previous results.

The highest activity, the recomputed ratios are in reasonable agreement with the ratios calculated on the basis of the operating history of the reactor (i. e. , beryllium additions, corrosion-product increases, and allowance for burnup). A method for the remote measurement of traces of HF in gas streams has been developed to cover the range.

Most significant of these constants, the molar exchange current, was found to be sufficiently large (~2 amp/cm²), which ensures that no polarization will occur during practical analytical measurements. The disproportionation of U(V) generated at a pyrolytic graphite anode was studied by chronopotentiometric methods. A rate constant of approximately 160 liters mole⁻¹sec⁻¹ was determined. The electrochemical reduction of Cr(II) was also studied in LiF, BeF₂, ZrF₄, by conventional and first-derivative voltammetry. Although U(IV) interferes to some extent, it is believed that the chromium reduction wave can be used to monitor chromium in fluoride.

The designing of the in-cell equipment of a facility for spectral studies of highly radioactive materials is essentially complete, and some of these components are now being fabricated. This equipment will permit the transfer of samples of radioactive fluoride salts to spectrophotometric cells without exposure of the samples to the atmosphere and will simultaneously maintain them at a temperature sufficient to eliminate significant.

The study of the spectra of Fe(II), Ni(II), Cr(II), and Cr(II) in various LiF-BeF2 melts has been concluded. Solvent contaminants, primarily products of hydrolysis, have been found to greatly affect the electrochemical generation of solute species for spectral characterization. Vacuum pretreatment of LiF-NaF-KF at 450°C is effective in removing the H2O precursor of these contaminants.

Work was continued on the stabilization of a helium breakdown detector for a gas chromatograph for MSRE blanket gases. Controlled additions of mercury vapor and hydrogen did not produce adequate stabilization, but xenon appears more promising. The thermal conductivity system installed in the gas sampling station at the MSRE was found to be subject to interference from the radiolysis of water absorbed in the reagents used to trap water and CO2. This trap has been replaced with a small regenerable trap packed with.

Of a detector of improved resolution, Ge(Li) diode, it was possible to identify and measure the distribution of ten nuclides. Quantitative measurements were reported for four major fission products. The improved detector was used also to measure the penetration of fission products.

The precision of the determination of 7°5U by delayed-neutron counting was improved to approximately 0.2%, about a factor of 2, by steps taken to define the irradiation and counting periods more precisely. A repetitive scan polarographic technique was found to provide uranium measurements with 0. 1% precision; however, the method is subject to a pronounced negative bias. A new method under development for the more precise determination of uranium in MSRE fuel is based on the volatilization of uranium from 50-g samples of UF6, which can then be collected on NaF, dissolved, and measured in the absence of interfering ions. An apparatus to perform this fluorination in a hot cell is now being used to separate uranium for isotopic ratio determinations. Before collection, the UF6 is passed over NaF at 400°C to reduce the radioactivity of the product.

A proton reaction method was used to measure 7Li and F concentrations in graphite exposed to nonradioactive MSRE fuel, graphite taken from the MSRE, and a graphite specimen that was taken from the thermal convection loop in the ORR. The technique offers the advantage of high sensitivity and good selectivity.

The ORR convection loop showed that the salt had wetted the graphite, contrary to the experience in the MSRE. Subsequent laboratory investigations of cover gas purity effects on wetting of graphite by salt have shown that extremely minute concentrations of moisture (<1 ppm) promote wetting at points of three-phase contact of salt, graphite, and gas.

Such atmospheres are not wetted. The results suggest that the ORR loop graphite was wetted during the multiple sample-withdrawal drain operation in which tank argon containing 4 ppm moisture was used to manipulate the salt. In future experiments, additional gas purification immediately preceding contact with salt must be provided.

The observed importance of the three-phase contact area also suggests that moisture-promoted wetting is limited to the graphite surface since the salt on the graphite surface will prevent moisture-containing gas from reaching a deeper contact area and enhancing the penetration.

A second Hastelloy N capsule containing an NaBF4-NaF mixture (92-8 mole %) was irradiated for 1460 hr at 600°C in three successive spent HFIR fuel elements. The measured gamma dose rate to the molten salt averaged 0. 15 w/g, with a maximum of 0. 5 w/g. This compares with estimated intensities of 0. 02 and 0. 25 w/g for MSRE and MSBR heat exchangers, respectively. No deleterious effects were observable during operation or in subsequent detailed examinations of the Hastelloy N, salt, and residual gas. The results were all comparable with those observed with a previously operated out-of-pile control.

The jumper section of the MSRE off-gas line, located 2 ft downstream from the pump bowl, was recovered for examination after run 14 to determine what substances, other than Kr-Xe daughters, are transferred from the system by the off-gas. All internal surfaces were covered with a thin, soot-like film, and no other deposits were found. A quantity of black dust was recovered from each end. This consisted largely of fine particles of fuel salt together with fission products.

Carbonaceous material is believed to result from the decomposition of lubricating oil that leaked into the pump bowl. Uranium was shown to be transferred only as an ingredient of the fuel salt particles, which are believed to be fine spray.

A group of fission products, largely noble metals (Mo, Ru, Ag, Te), and iodine, which is the daughter of Te, were present in quantities several hundred times the inventory proportion of salt present; thus, substantiating earlier hypotheses that "noble metals could be transferred in the off-gas. " The proportions of Mo, Ru, Ag, Te, and I were only moderately below those of the Kr-Xe daughter isotopes (Sr, Y, Cs, and Ba). Definite but smaller proportions of niobium were found. Isotopes of Zr, Nd, and Ce, which form very stable fluorides, did not exceed the inventory proportion.

Hastelloy N and graphite surveillance samples were removed from the MSRE after 72,400 MWhr of operation. The samples were in excellent condition and were very compatible with their service environment. The damaging fluence on the graphite is only of the order of 10^20 neutrons/cm, and the property and dimensional changes are small.

We have obtained several types of graphite from commercial vendors and from the Chemical Engineering Development Department of the Y-12 Plant that are of interest for future MSBRs and for broadening our understanding of radiation damage in graphite. Our evaluation of the products involves the measurement of physical and mechanical properties as well as dimensional changes during irradiation. Several graphites have been irradiated, although higher fluences are required to determine.

We plan to reduce the surface diffusivity of graphite to less than 10 cm/sec to prevent the absorption of 35Xe. We believe that this is best done by impregnating the surface of graphite with pyrocarbon and have worked out a potential process using an alternating vacuum-1,3-butadiene atmosphere at 800 to 1000°C.

Several samples are presently being irradiated to determine whether the low permeability is retained. We have investigated sealing the graphite with molybdenum but find that the allowable quantity of <0. 0002 in. is not sufficient to reduce the permeability to <107.

We have continued the development of our titanium-modified Hastelloy N and have procured one large 5000-lb melt for evaluation. Post-irradiation creep-rupture tests show that the properties measured at 650°C are good as long as the irradiation temperature is not above 650°C. This variation in properties appears to be related to a change in the carbide from Ti(C,N,B) at 650°C to Mo,C above 700°C. This same transformation occurs in the absence of irradiation and results in changes in the mechanical properties. The weldability of the titanium-modified alloy seems good, although we have found that our large 5000-lb heat does not make good filler metal for welding.

Our corrosion studies have shown that the new coolant salt, sodium fluoroborate, and Hastelloy N are reasonably compatible. Moisture was inadvertently admitted into our thermal convection loops, and the corrosion rate increased.

Techniques for making this joint, one involving brazing, and the other using a graded joint where W-Ni-Fe alloys of variable composition are used to bridge the gap in thermal expansion between graphite and Hastelloy N. Several joints of both designs have been made and thermally cycled to demonstrate their soundness. An inspection technique has been developed for the brazed.

In anticipation of needing to make welds in irradiated materials, we made fusion passes in several tensile samples removed from the MSRE. The welds have as good properties as the irradiated base metal, but there seems to be some additional difficulty in getting sound welds in them.

Distribution of uranium, protactinium, thorium, and rare earths between molten fluoride salts and lithium-bismuth solutions are being studied in support of reductive extraction processes for single-fluid MSR fuels. Distribution coefficient data at 600°C. These data, combined with earlier results, show that the uranium-protactinium separation factor is about 100 and that the protactinium-thorium separation factor is about 4300. Other experiments established that the solubility of protactinium in bismuth is at least 2000 ppm at 550°C and that bismuth solutions containing at least 1000 ppm of both protactinium and thorium can be produced at 600°C. These results establish the chemical feasibility of the protactinium isolation portion of the proposed process. Data from other experiments showed that lanthanum and europium could be separated from thorium, but that the separation factors generally were in the range of 1 to 3.

Equipment is needed to efficiently contact streams of salt and bismuth. Since the available correlations for the design of liquid-liquid extraction systems are based on conditions far removed from those of interest, data are being obtained with a water-mercury system, which more closely resembles a salt-bismuth system. Measurements of flooding, holdup, and pressure drop have been made in a 1-in. -ID column using several packings.

Equipment is being installed for semi-continuous experiments on reductive extraction. The transfer of uranium from a salt to a metal stream will be studied in a system containing a 0. 82-in. ID x 2-ft-long column packed with ½-in. right circular cylinders of molybdenum. The experiments will use 15-liter batches of molten salt, and bismuth effluent streams from the column can be sampled during the experiments.

Equipment is being developed for the continuous removal of UF from a salt stream by countercurrently contacting the salt with F in a salt-phase continuous system. The equipment will be protected from corrosion by freezing a layer of salt on the vessel wall. The heat necessary for maintaining molten salt adjacent to frozen salt will be provided by the decay of fission products in the salt stream. A series of experiments was recently concluded using countercurrent flow of salt and an inert gas in a 5-in. -diameter, 8-ft-high column having an internal heat source.

The development of the two-step process has proven to be a significant advancement in streamlining our workflow. Its implementation has led to increased efficiency and improved outcomes. This methodology allows for a structured approach to complex tasks, ensuring that each stage is completed thoroughly before progressing to the next. By breaking down the process into two distinct steps, we can better manage resources and monitor progress effectively. The first step focuses on initial planning and analysis, laying the foundation for the subsequent step which involves execution and implementation. This sequential approach not only enhances productivity but also minimizes errors by providing checkpoints at key intervals.

ft³ of salt per day per square foot of vaporization surface. These rates are acceptable for the use of distillation as a process step. Samples taken during the runs showed entrainment and concentration polarization to be negligible. Post-operational inspection showed the still to be in good condition.

Last-minute tests with the facility to recover the uranium from MSRE fuel salt raised several questions that required additional experimental work. The most significant were the corrosion rate during fluorination and the associated corrosion product.

Contamination, the suitability of the sodium fluoride; preparation of 7LiF-223UF, the sorption beds; and finally, the behavior of the concentrate for the MSRE fluoride disposal system. Laboratory work was performed in each area of concern. Studies with mole % eutectic salt were prepared to refuel the allayed fears of excessive corrosion. Comparison of MSRE. Cell G of the Thorium-Uranium Recycle of alternative packings led to the recommendation facility was used to provide shielding for the of a high-surface-area material. It was recommended that fluorine be deliberately added to the gas stream leaving the fluorinator to avoid exposing the high-temperature trap to pure UF gas, which would have caused a uranium loss at this point. An aqueous solution of KOH-KI-K, B40 was.

The six-month period reported here saw the conclusion of operations with 35U and final preparations for the substitution of 5U in the fuel salt. Nuclear operation of the reactor ended a few weeks after the beginning of the period, following a very successful six-month run. After testing and modification, the chemical processing equipment, which is an integral part of the facility, was used to fluorinate the uranium out of the salt.

The facility was operating and had been for over five months. An extended shutdown was scheduled to begin on March 26. "Removal of core specimens, inspection, and some necessary maintenance were to be done early. Later, the salt was to be processed to remove the uranium so that 3°U could be substituted for the enriched 55U used originally. ".

The final weeks of nuclear operation were busy with tests that defined the characteristics of the system as it reached the end of operation with U fuel. For the first week in March, the reactor was operated at reduced power (5 MW) and various temperatures and pressures to measure xenon poisoning.

Run. Then it was held at 10 kW for three days to permit a reactivity measurement with practically no xenon in the reactor. Finally, the reactor was run at the full power of 8 MW for two weeks just before the shutdown to build up the inventory of fission products whose distributions were to be studied soon after the fuel was drained. The off-gas sampler was used to trap a sample for xenon isotopic analysis, and thermal conductivity measurements of off-gas contaminants were made for the first time. Several dynamics experiments were also conducted, some to try new methods of investigation, others for comparison with the reactor characteristics observed two years earlier. Power operation was concluded with a rod and load scram on March 25. After a delay to allow afterheat to diminish, the fuel was drained.

The reactor was critical 4423 hours (98% of the time). The only interruption of any significance had been a week in November when the sampler-enticher wiring was being repaired. It was not necessary to drain the fuel then, but for two days, fuel circulation was stopped, and the reactor was subcritical. Statistics at the end of run 14 and the end of operation with 95U are listed in Table 1.1.

On March 11, two weeks before the end of power operation, the fuel sampler-enricher malfunctioned. During an attempt to take a 10-g sample of the fuel salt, the latch apparently hung up, and over 17 ft of drive cable was unreeled into the small isolation chamber, where it became tangled. Efforts to reel it back up were unsuccessful, and no more samples were taken in the remaining 15 days of fuel circulation. After the fuel was drained on March 26, the isolation chamber was opened, and the cable was untangled. In the manipulations, the capsule came unlatched and was dropped into the tube, with the magnetic cap downward.

The 50-gram sample, but the long capsule was not fully submerged. A 10-gram sample was taken successfully. Construction was started immediately on a mockup of the sampler tube, latch stop, cage, and baffle to be used in developing tools and planning efforts to retrieve the capsule.

The first two weeks were tightly scheduled with activities involved in different ways with the study of the fission product distribution. As soon as the fuel was drained, the reactor cell roof was opened, and equipment was set up to measure the gamma-ray spectrum from various sites on the fuel system. Readings were obtained on the fuel heat exchanger before, during, and after flush salt circulation. Two defective heater units were removed from around the heat exchanger while the maintenance shield was set up at that point. The graphite and metal specimens were then removed from the core for disassembly and study. A removable section of the fuel off-gas line was taken out for analysis of the material that had accumulated in it. A flexible tool was used to clear out the line back into the pump bowl, where a restriction had been perceptible at times during run 14. A new section of the off-gas line, equipped with thermocouples, was then installed. The heater units, which meanwhile had been repaired, were reinstalled on the heat exchanger. Interspersed with these jobs in the reactor cell was more gamma spectrometry at sites selected from gamma-ray source photographs made with a pinhole camera. By this time, the core specimen array had been reassembled with some new specimens, and it was reinstalled in.

Meanwhile, in the chemical processing facility adjacent to the fuel drain tank cell, preparations had been started for the processing of the flush and fuel salts. The salt transfer line was cut, and the new 9-ft filter, designed to remove corrosion-product solids from the fluorinated salt before its reuse in the reactor, was installed. The system for adding fluorine and disposing of the excess by reaction with SO2 gas was tried briefly a week after.

The TWC control was improved, and the alumina trap was reloaded and provided with heaters to increase its capacity. However, a test early in May showed there was still incomplete reaction of the fluorine and SO2. Heaters and a temperature control system were installed to improve the gas preheating.

Again, it showed a temperature rise in the backup alumina bed; this was taken to mean fluorine was still getting through the fluorine-SO2 reactor. In the meantime, laboratory tests had verified that it should be practical to react fluorine with a caustic solution in the scrubber tank just downstream of the absorbers that remove UF6 from the gas stream. Attention then turned to this method of disposal of fluorine. Tests in the mockup of the fuel sampler had by now shown that a permanent magnet should be capable of retrieving the sample capsules, both the.

One capsule dropped in run 14 and the one dropped in August 1967. Two weeks of intensive efforts at retrieval resulted only in recovery of the corroded cap of the first capsule, and the conclusion that the capsules had been worked into a certain position whence they could not be retrieved with a magnet. Tests of dislodging tools in the mockup followed. Results were too disappointing, however, for an attempt in the pump bowl, where fission product contamination would make dislodging efforts expensive and time-consuming.

A preliminary test of the caustic solution method of fluorine disposal in the chemical plant showed that fluorine could indeed be disposed of very efficiently at the required rates. Therefore, the fluorine-SO2 reaction system was removed, and the permanent repiping necessary to put the alumina trap downstream of the caustic scrubber was done. This work was finished by early July. A test showed good fluorine reaction, but an aerosol of molybdenum oxides from the caustic scrubber plugged the line to the alumina trap.

The first step in the actual processing of the salt came on August 1 when the flushed salt was transferred into the storage tank. Corrosion-product fluorides produced during the fluorination were converted to filterable metallic particles by treatment with hydrogen gas and finely divided zirconium.

Meanwhile, the salt circulating systems had been heated, and as soon as the flush salt was available, the fuel loop was filled, and circulation started. (The coolant loop was also filled, and coolant circulation continued through the end of the report period. It also permitted a test of the sampler-enricher. A 10-g sample was obtained without difficulty, but a long 50-g capsule was only half submerged, stopped by an obstruction (presumably the wire on the lost capsule) in the sampler cage. Two 25-g samples were obtained, leading to the conclusion that the obstruction would not prevent sampling and monitoring the fuel salt during subsequent reactor operation.

The fuel salt was transferred into the storage tank on August 18. Three days were spent in obtaining samples defining the salt conditions at the end of the operation. (The sampler-enricher malfunction had prevented these from being taken on the last days of nuclear operation). On August 23, fluorination of the fuel charge was started, and six days later, the 219 kg of uranium had been loaded onto 28 absorbers filled with sodium fluoride pellets. No difficulty was encountered in the process, and excellent recovery and decontamination were achieved. Another ten days passed, and the corrosion products had been reduced and filtered out, leaving the stripped fuel carrier salt in the reactor drain tank ready for the addition of 793U.

Portions of the MSRE salt processing facility were tested in the course of the hydrofluorination of the flush salt in May 1965; however, the fluorine supply and disposal equipment had never been operated before this report period. Highly efficient disposal of the fluorine within the system was essential to prevent unreacted fluorine from causing the release of radioiodine from the charcoal traps in the process off-gas line.

The original design of the processing facility involved reacting fluorine with sulfur dioxide gas at temperatures above 400°F to form sulfuryl fluoride, SO2F2, a relatively inert gas that could be discharged to the atmosphere. Later, a heated bed of activated alumina was provided downstream of the SO2F2 reactor to remove traces of fluorine during normal operation and to protect the charcoal traps in case of a malfunction of the reactor.

April 5 and May 21, four test runs were made on this system. Despite various modifications and improvements, in each run, there was some temperature increase in the alumina bed, implying that some fluorine was reaching it. Later, it was shown that decomposition of SOF at temperatures above 800°F was probably the cause of the temperature rise in the later tests. However, since it had not been possible to demonstrate complete reaction of the fluorine with the SO2-F2 scheme, the decision was made to adopt the alternative of reacting the fluorine with a caustic solution.

Scrubber tank showed that a solution of 2 M KOH + 0.33 M KI very efficiently removed fluorine from a helium-fluorine stream. After the necessary modifications were made in the processing facility to eliminate the SO2F2 reaction equipment, an extended test of the fluorine disposal in the caustic solution was made. This test showed that a filter was needed downstream of the caustic scrubber to handle molybdenum oxides entrained in the off-gas. A larger off-gas line to a high-area glass-fiber filter was then installed. At the same time, dual inlet-gas dip tubes were installed in the scrubber tank because occasional temporary plugging was expected on the basis of laboratory test runs.

The final modification before salt processing began was to provide means to preheat the NaF absorbers to 250°F to increase the rate of UF absorption. (The maximum temperature could be limited to 400°F by air cooling. ) The flush salt was transferred into the storage tank on August 1, and, after sampling, fluorination was started on August 2 with the salt at 875°F. After 6.6 hr of sparging with fluorine, the uranium in the flush salt was down to only 7 ppm (30 g of the original 6 kg or so of uranium). Weight increases in the NaF absorbers amounted to 9.6 kg, somewhat more than expected, "but within the scatter of the UF calculated from the initial uranium analyses of the salt. The loading was rather spread out — weight increases in the re 6.9 kg, 2.7 kg, and about 0.2 kg. This was attributed to HF which had gotten through the HF removal trap in the fluorine addition system and had interfered with the.

There were 2.3 kg of nickel, 0.9 kg of iron, and 0.6 kg of chromium as fluorides in the flush salt after fluorination, mostly from corrosion of the storage tank during fluorine-disposal testing and flush-salt fluorination. These fluorides were reduced to the metals by treatment with hydrogen and zirconium. Eleven hours of hydrogen sparging at 1225°F for NiF reduction was followed by the addition of 1. 07 kg of zirconium and more hydrogen sparging to reduce the FeF and CrF. The salt was then filtered through a 9-ft filter of sintered fibrous Inconel as it was being returned to the reactor drain tank. Samples showed that the structural metal concentrations were satisfactorily low after.

Before the fuel salt was fluorinated, several changes were made. The HF trap in the fluorine supply was improved by substitution of high-surface-area sodium fluoride pellets for the low-surface-area material used previously. Some piping changes were made in the absorber cubicle for more flexibility and convenience in changing absorbers. As an added precaution against accidental criticality in the caustic scrubber, the prescribed solution was changed to include boron (0.2 M K2B4O7). Two fission chambers were also installed to monitor neutron multiplication. The salt in the storage tank was itself a strong neutron source.

Fuel salt fluorination started on August 23rd. Fluorine was bubbled into the salt at 33 std liters/min for 8 hours, converting the UF4 to UF6 before UF6 began to be evolved at a detectable rate. Thereafter, another 39 hours of fluorine sparging at lower rates were required to bring the uranium content of the salt down to 26 ppm. The fluorination extended over a six-day period, as it was necessary to stop five times to replace the UF6 absorbers, the caustic scrubber solution, and the fluorine supply trailers. No significant difficulties were encountered during.

After fluorination, the stripped fuel carrier salts the fluorides. These were reduced to the metals, first by hydrogen sparging at 1230°F for a total of 52 hr; then by the addition of a total of 5.0 kg of finely divided zirconium, followed by hydrogen and helium.

After filtered samples showed that the corrosion product fluorides were satisfactorily low, the salt was transferred through the large filter to the fuel drain tank. When dip samples from the drain tank showed that the reduction and filtration had been successful, the salt processing was at an.

Fluorination: The 4280 kg of flush salt contained about 6 kg of uranium before fluorination. A flow of 25 std liters/min of F, diluted with a like amount of helium, was maintained for a total of 6.6 hr. At this point, fluorination was stopped because the mass flowmeters at the entrance and exit of the absorbers showed that UF6 evolution had practically ceased. Samples of the salt taken after 5 hr of fluorination and at the end subsequently showed 24 ppm of uranium and 7 ppm of uranium, respectively.

Started at a gas sparge rate of 33 std liters/min of F2. The fluorine utilization was very high at first, but no appreciable UF6 was evolved until after practically all the UF4 had been converted to UF6. This occurred after 8 hr. When the inlet flowmeter and the temperature in the first absorber showed that UF6 was coming off, the fluorine was reduced to 24 std liters/min to limit the UF6 flow for the sake of more efficient absorption on the low-surface area NaF in the first absorber of the five-absorber train. In later runs even lower fluorine flows were used. 2 for each of the six runs. The rather high utilization is probably attributable to the depth of the salt—the fluorine and helium were injected 64 in. below the surface through four ⅛-in. holes near the closed lower end of a 1-in. vertical pipe. The variation of utilization with sparge rate is evident from Table 1.2. The low utilization in run 6 came as the uranium concentration was being reduced to 26 ppm.

All the beds used in the flush salt run contained LSA NaF. Breakthrough of UF₂ into the second and third beds was observed, even though one bed should have had more than enough capacity for all the UF evolved. When the absorbers were removed and weighed, the first, second, and third absorbers showed weight gains of 6.9 kg, 2.7 kg, and about 1.2 kg more than the weight of UF₂, equivalent to all the uranium in the flush salt as calculated from the standard fluorimetric uranium analyses. However, the weight increase checks closely with the uranium calculated from two samples analyzed by neutron activation. Examination showed that some HF had reached the absorbers and had reacted with the NaF, probably accounting for the low loading.

As a result of laboratory tests and the somewhat questionable performance of the LSA NaF in the flush salt run, most of the absorbers were reloaded with HSA material. The available amount was insufficient to change all the absorbers; however, some LSA absorbers were used during the fuel salt.

Thermocouples in the NaF beds near the inlet of each absorber clearly showed when UF6 began to be absorbed there. In run 1, the fluorine flow was stopped when UF6 reached the third absorber. Some additional UF6 was brought through as the gas space in the storage tank was swept out with helium before the absorbers were removed. Weights showed that practically no uranium had reached the fourth absorber, so in the next run fluorine was not stopped until a temperature rise showed in absorber 4. The fifth absorber was kept as a backup to ensure that no substantial amount of UF6 could get through to the aqueous solution in the caustic scrubber.

Analysis of the caustic solutions removed from the scrubber tank showed 4.2 g of uranium during the flush salt runs and <1 g of uranium during the fuel salt runs. These amounts are consistent with the UF that should have gotten through due to the finite vapor pressure of UF over NaF.

The total amount of uranium, 218.0 kg, calculated from the weight gains of the absorbers, is 1.1 kg less than the amount believed, on the basis of prior physical inventories, to be in the fuel salt charge. The weight determinations on the absorbers. The loaded absorbers were stored in a spare cell.

A comparison of the performance of the LSA and HSA NaF pellets is shown in Figure 3. Three absorbers containing each type of NaF were used in uranium loading was obtained at lower temperature. The LSA NaF retained 13 to 14% more uranium than the HSA NaF, in spite of the higher temperatures at which the LSA absorbers were operated.

Fission Product Behavior. The decontamination factor for the process is the ratio of fission product activity per gram of uranium in the salt to the activity per gram of recovered uranium. Factors were determined by salt samples and the weighted average of NaF samples taken from the inlet of the first absorber in each run. 6 x 10^8; for gross beta activity, 1.2 x 10^9. This excellent decontamination meant that, in contrast with the fuel salt, which was reading about 1800 r/hr at several feet, the absorbers were reading only a few mr/hr and could be handled directly.

One factor in the relatively low corrosion rates was probably the low temperature. (Most previous experience had been at 1100 to 1300°F. ) Another factor is the fact that the fluorine was released at the vertical center line of the 50-in. -diameter tank of salt, which would tend to reduce the fluorine concentration at the walls. On the other hand, the corrosion products in the flush salt include those produced during a 2-hr exposure of the empty tank to fluorine at 1125°F before the salt processing.

NiF to the metals before returning the salts to the reactor; otherwise, they would attack the chromium in the Hastelloy N. It was also highly desirable to reduce the amount of chromium in the fuel salt so that it could again serve as a sensitive indicator of corrosion during reactor operation. Laboratory tests had shown that the corrosion products could be effectively removed by reduction of the fluorides to the metals and filtration of the agglomerated metallic particles. The NiF could be reduced by hydrogen sparging at high temperature; finely divided zirconium metal was prescribed to reduce the FeF, and CrF. Filtration was to be accomplished by a 9-ft filter newly installed in the line between the storage tank and the reactor drain tank system. The filter medium was sintered fibrous Inconel.

The overall effectiveness of the process is demonstrated by the results in Table 1. 5, which lists corrosion product concentrations in dipped samples of salt just after fluorination and after the reduction and filtration. It would appear that the process was not as effective for FeF and CrF as for NiF.

While the flush salt was being treated, several attempts to take filtered samples in evacuated capsules with fusible seals were unsuccessful. As a result, no analysis was obtained after the initial 11-hour sparge with hydrogen at 1225°F. Proceeding on the assumption that the NiF had been reduced by the hydrogen, we added 0. 6 kg of zirconium metal to reduce the FeF2 and CrF2. (The zirconium was added as slugs of partially compacted turnings, dropped in through the storage tank sampler.) After 9 hours of sparging with hydrogen following the zirconium addition, a sample attempt was successful.

Results showed that the nickel was down by a factor of 10, but the iron and chromium were not significantly changed. Therefore, another 0. 5 kg of zirconium was added, and the tank was sparged with hydrogen for 16 hours. Another sample attempt was unsuccessful, but since the chromium was not excessive in the previous sample, the flush salt was transferred to the drain tank through the filter. Subsequent samples gave the results shown in Table 1. 5. There was little difference between samples taken in filter capsules and in open buckets, indicating that the corrosion products were either dissolved fluorides or very finely divided metals.

Before the fuel salt was processed, a new type of capsule had been invented. It had two compartments: one above a filter element; the other below. Salt flowed into the upper compartment when the capsule was submerged. Then, when the capsule was lifted, cooling of the gas in the lower compartment produced a partial vacuum, which pulled salt down through the filter disk. With this type of capsule, samples were obtained as needed during the fuel salt treatment. Thus, the progress of the reduction could be followed, and the utilization of hydrogen and zirconium could be computed.

The fuel salt was sparged with 10 to 30 std liters/min of hydrogen and 5 to 10 std liters/min of helium at 1230°F for 17 hr before the first sample. Dip line plugging in the caustic scrubber prevented continuous operation at the higher rates. After this period, the scrubber solution was replaced, which eliminated the plugging difficulty. Inexplicably, the nickel analysis of the filtered sample was higher by almost a factor of 2 than in the dipped sample at the start. Therefore, the hydrogen treatment was continued for another 17 hr. When a sample showed the nickel concentration down some but not enough, another 18 hr of hydrogen sparging was given. A filtered sample then showed the nickel at 180 ppm, down from 840 ppm at the start. The hydrogen utilization computed from this reduction was 2.1%. At this point, 4.9 kg of zirconium turnings were dropped into the tank, and the salt was hydrogen sparged for 24 hr. The salt was then cooled to 1050°F (to improve filter-element strength) and transferred to the drain tank. Samples gave the results shown in Table 1. 5. If the change in nickel.

A great deal of effort was spent on improving the performance of the fluorine reactor before this approach was abandoned. Once the salt processing was actually started, the major equipment performed well, although there were a few minor problems.

Fluorine Reactor. The original fluorine disposal system used a fluorine reactor design similar to that used for routine fluorine disposal at the gaseous diffusion facility in Portsmouth, Ohio. This, in turn, was a scale-up of work done at ORGDP. With low fluorine concentrations - when the heat of reaction is low - it was found necessary to improve the insulation of the fluorine and sulfur dioxide lines to the reactor and to install additional heaters on the reactor inlet in order to maintain the inlet section above 400°F. Procedures were modified to prevent overcooling by steam when the reaction rate is low. Similarly, heaters were installed on the line between the reactor and backup alumina trap and on the trap inlet to maintain the entire trap at 900°F. With these modifications, it is now believed that the system probably would have been satisfactory if the alumina trap had been operated below the SO2F2 decomposition temperature - about 800°F.

Absorber Cubicle Blower. This blower failed during the first fuel fluorination run, apparently due to the rotor slipping on the shaft. Operation continued without it when induced flow to the processing cell proved adequate to keep the cubicle pressure negative relative to the operating area. The cooling air required to keep the absorbers below 350°F did not produce excessive pressure drop in the line connecting the cubicle to the.

Problems were anticipated from laboratory tests. Plugging persisted throughout the fluorination, occurring several times per hour and required almost constant attention. Plugging was cleared by switching to the spare line for several minutes, then returning to the original line. These meters, installed at the inlet and outlet of the UF absorber train, indicate the product of the mass flow rate and the heat capacity of the gas stream.

The inlet meter provided a very sharp indication of the start of volatilization of UF. In each run, the outlet meter, which would have revealed a UF breakthrough if it had occurred, in general (except for run 2), gave anomalously high readings. This could have been due to MoF6.

The differences between the inlet and outlet flow meter readings, taken in conjunction with measured inputs of fluorine and helium, were used to calculate rates and amounts of UF6 volatilized and F2 utilized. Figure 1.4 shows the differential readings. As a check, the difference between the inlet and outlet meters was integrated to get the total amount of uranium volatilized in the six runs. The result was within 5% of the amount determined by weighing the absorbers. The fluorine utilization during the initial period of conversion of UF6 to UF4 (run 1A) was calculated during two periods of relatively steady operation to be 69% and 63%. This agrees very well with the average of 65.8% calculated from the fluorine input before the start of UF6 evolution. The maxima in the UF6 flow rates shown in Figure 1.4 were used to compute the maximum utilizations listed in Table 1.1. As can be seen from run 5, at least 8 hr of steady operation is required for the UF6 concentration to reach a maximum.

During the final six-month period of power operation with 55U fuel (run 14), we measured the zero-power reactivity balance five times at intervals of 4000 to 9000 MWhr. These measurements, over a period of substantial fuel burnup without fuel additions or dilutions, permitted a clear comparison between the observed and predicted reactivity behavior. The data showed a very small but significant negative trend in the residual term in the reactivity balance. (The residual reactivity is essentially the observed reactivity minus that predicted. ) Although this trend did not agree with the apparent absence of significant net change over the entire period of operation up to run 14, it was not clearly inconsistent with earlier experience during any single run. Furthermore, during run 14, the uranium concentration observed in the fuel salt samples appeared to decrease faster than the calculated burnup. This review led to some refinements and correction of some errors that significantly altered the overall picture.

One very important correction was in the integrated power, which affects many of the calculated terms in the reactivity balance. While the review of the reactivity balance was in progress, new measurements of salt heat capacity showed that the MSRE power was actually 11% higher than had been reported in 9.3 of this report.

The most significant changes were made in the term that describes the long-term isotopic changes in the core. This term was originally intended to describe only the reactivity effects of non-saturating and slowly saturating fission products. However, in developing the balance equations, it became.

It is apparent that a number of other isotopic changes in the core would have significant reactivity effects. Since the time dependence of these effects was similar to that of the fission products, it was convenient to group all of them in one term of the reactivity balance. Thus, the isotopic change term includes, in addition to the fission and B. Except for boron, which was present in small amounts in the core graphite, all of these isotopic changes occur in the fuel salt. Evaluation of the reactivity effects of the long-term isotopic changes would be relatively straightforward if all the various chemical species were physically and chemically stable. In that case, it would be valid to assume that all the original species and their reaction products remain in the medium (graphite or fuel salt) in which they are formed. Figure 1.5 shows the major individual components as well as the net change.

As a function of integrated power, the most important terms are the buildup of ^39Pu and non-saturating fission products. Although these terms have opposite signs and almost cancel each other, the net reactivity change is positive because of the burnout of other species that act as neutron poisons. We believe there is little uncertainty or error in the reactivity effects of all the components shown in Figure 5, with one exception.

Many of the decay chains include noble gases (xenon and krypton) with substantial half-lives. Since these gases are largely insoluble in the fluoride salt melt, they tend to escape into the off-gas system. In addition, there is evidence that significant fractions of some noble metals (notably Mo, Te, Ru, Tc, and Nb) are also removed by the off-gas system, either as volatile fluorides or as colloidal metallic particles. Another mechanism for loss of poisoning, which occurs to some extent, is the plateout of fission products on.

Upon review, the text appears to be free of any spelling or punctuation errors. Therefore, I will provide the text in its original form: 1106p the scale shown in. 5, the reactivity effects due to burnout of U and the associated production of 235U are negligible and, therefore, are not shown. They are included in the net result.

A factor that enhances the poisoning effect of some fission products is the diffusion of some volatile species into the pores of the graphite. It is clear from the above that very detailed information about the behavior of all the fission products would be required for an absolutely rigorous description of their poisoning effect in the MSRE. This information is not currently available.

To obtain some indication of the effect of fission product loss on the net poisoning, we made calculations for two idealized cases. These assumed, in one case, the removal of 100% of the noble gases and, in the other case, concurrent removal of both the noble gases and the noble metals. The only members of the latter category that are significant neutron poisons are molybdenum, ruthenium, and tellurium. Figure 1.6 shows the net fission product reactivity effect for the two extreme cases along with the case for full retention of all fission products. The direct poisoning by ^135Xe is treated separately in the reactivity balance and is, therefore, not included in this analysis.

In the absence of quantitative information on the behavior of all the fission products, we assumed for the reactivity balance calculation the removal of all the noble gases and none of the noble metals. Figure 1.7 shows, as a function of integrated power, the residual reactivity that was obtained. The straight line is a least-squares fit of all the data.

To change its direction, a detailed sensitivity analysis of the calculational model was made by varying important input parameters by 15% from the values used. The most important parameters are cross sections and effective fluxes, and flux ratios in the core. This analysis indicated an overall uncertainty in the long-term isotopic changes of +0.05% Δk/k at 70,000 MWhr. The uncertainty associated with the assumption of fission product behavior is also about +0.05% Δk/k. Thus, the residual reactivity at the end of the 35U operation was probably.

Near the end of operation with the 235U fuel loading, dynamic tests were performed on the MSRE to reevaluate the frequency response of the system. Results of these tests permitted a comparison of the dynamic response of the MSRE after more than 70,000 MWhr with that observed in the initial experiments at power. Portions of the tests also tried a new test signal and a different testing method on a well-known system.

Inputs and reactivity inputs follow a pseudorandom binary sequence (PRBS). The latter is referred to as a rod-jog test. The tests at the end of operation with 7.5 MW repeated the step tests at 5 and 8 MW, and a 127-bit rod-jog test was repeated at 8 MW. These provided a means of direct comparison with the earlier tests. 95 MW operation are in excellent agreement, in both magnitude and shape, with the results obtained during the initial power tests. Thus, they show that there has been no change in the dynamic behavior of the MSRE after more than 70,000 MWhr of nuclear operation. This was identified earlier as 7.5 MW, but since the correction of the power calibration, the accepted value is 8 MW.

The implementation of a pseudorandom reactivity input requires exact control rod positioning and repeatability. This was accomplished by putting a false signal into the servo. The servo interprets this signal as a need for rod movement and moves the rod to match the input from the neutron instrumentation with the false input flux demand. By manipulation of the flux demand signal, the flux can be forced to approximate any reasonable test signal.

The new test signal that we desired to use was the pseudorandom ternary sequence (PRTS). The PRTS is a special series of positive, negative, and zero pulses (bits) chosen so that the autocorrelation function of the test signal approximates the autocorrelation function of white noise. The PRTS is of interest as a tool for frequency response testing because it has a flat power spectrum over a wide frequency range, which provides information over a wide frequency band with only one test. It is similar to the PRBS in this respect but has the additional advantage of a zero average value. Detailed descriptions of the PRTS may be found in refs. 15 and 16. To our knowledge, this is the first time this test signal has been employed as a tool in experimental frequency response measurements. For similar tests, there was no apparent difference between results obtained using the PRBS and PRTS testing signal.

Results of the various frequency-response tests performed at the end of power operation with 95U. Results of pseudorandom tests shown in these figures were obtained using the flux-demand technique, unless otherwise noted. The shape of all the observed curves is as predicted.

Responding to theoretical curves and the experimental results from the earlier testing programs, we believe this to be a result of hardware limitations which were emphasized by the change in testing technique. The control rods are required to behave quite differently for the two types of tests. During the rod-jog tests, the rod is moved, held constant for a number of seconds, then moved to a new position; whereas the new method (flux-demand) requires almost constant rod movement. Discrepancy between the actual rod position and the indicated rod position may be the reason for the apparent shift in magnitude ratio.

The terms "direct analysis" and "indirect analysis" shown on the figures indicate the type of mathematical treatment performed on the data. As used in this text, the direct method involves generating the necessary power spectra directly, whereas the indirect method first calculates the necessary correlation functions and then converts these to power spectra. The different types of analyses yield essentially the same results when applied to the same data, as shown in the figures.

From the results of the dynamic tests, we conclude that the dynamic behavior of the MSRE has remained essentially unchanged since the initial approach to power. The reactor system is stable at all power levels, with the degree of stability increasing with increasing power level.

Operation of the MSRE has shown that a small amount of undissolved helium cover gas circulates with the fuel stream. Observed shifts in the reactivity balance were used to calculate the changes in void fraction with changing operating conditions, but the absolute void fraction had eluded measurement. Neutron noise analysis has now been used in conjunction with an analytical model of the system to infer a value for the void fraction.

According to the model, the neutron power spectral density (NPSD) in the frequency range from 0.5 to 2 hertz should vary as the square of the helium void fraction in the fuel salt. During the experiments with the MSRE in run 14, the NPSD was found to be most sensitive to changes in fuel temperature: the NPSD around 1 hertz increased by a factor of almost 50 when the core outlet temperature was lowered from 1225 to 1180°F. Over the same range, the reactivity balance showed that the void fraction increased by 0.18% from some indeterminate minimum volume. The minimum void fraction was inferred by fitting the data on NPSD and changes in the void fraction to the relationship predicted by the model.

From the analytical model of the system, it was possible to derive a theoretical pressure-to-flux transfer function whose gain depended on the void fraction in the fuel salt. The transfer function was measured experimentally, and the void fraction was calculated that would make the predicted transfer function agree with that observed.

The fuel pressure was varied in a periodic manner by flowing helium into the pump bowl at a constant rate and opening a valve at regular intervals to vent the helium to a drain tank being held at low pressure. The resultant sawtooth pressure perturbations had a maximum amplitude.

Bowl pressure was about 5 psig, the core outlet temperature was 1210°F, and the power was 8 MW during the test. The pressure signal and neutron flux signal were amplified and simultaneously recorded on magnetic tape. A flux-to-pressure transfer function was then obtained by three different methods: (1) by the digital cross-correlation procedure; (2) by the direct Fourier.

Transform the procedure by determining the absolute auto-power spectral density (APSD) of the pressure and neutron flux signals using a calibrated analog spectral density analyzer. Furthermore, the relative APSDs of the two signals were obtained using the digital program normally used for the neutron noise data reduction schemes on the online BR-340 computer. These results are given in Fig. 11. 15 hertz). Comparison of the experimental and theoretical flux-to-pressure transfer functions indicated a void fraction of 0. 03% with an uncertainty of +0. 015% and -0. 01%. The uncertainties assigned are due primarily to uncertainties in the model used for the prediction of the theoretical transfer function. For the conditions of the test, reactivity balance measurements had indicated that the void fraction was near its minimum value.

Before the MSRE was taken to power, nickel and type 304 stainless steel wires were installed in the reactor furnace adjacent to the vessel surveillance specimens, about 5 in. from the vessel wall, to serve as neutron flux monitors. The isotopes which were used as monitors are listed in Table 1.6 along with the reaction which occurs when the isotope interacts with a neutron. The high threshold energies for the (n, p) reactions make it possible to determine the flux as a function of energy as well as axial position.

After being exposed to about 36,000 MWh of a microscopic cross-section for the reaction of power operation (through run 11), the wires were of interest, removed from the reactor furnace and taken to a decay constant of the product nuclide hot cell. The wires were subsequently cut into time in neutron flux; short segments, and the gamma activity of each decay time piece was determined. The flux was then calculated using the general expression, which would be the average value over the appropriate.

The furnace is somewhat different; the error in the average cross-section is believed to be quite small. The atom density was obtained from chemical analyses and densities of the samples. The calculation was carried out using a computer program that accounts for the detailed power.

Also shown in 0.12 are fluxes recently calculated from low-power (1 kW) irradiation of gold and copper foils. The data from this irradiation were reevaluated using cross sections for the MSRE spectrum instead of the cross sections used in the original calculation.

The peak thermal flux (E < 0.876 eV) in the reactor furnace is about 1 x 10^11 neutrons per sec per MW and occurs about 30 in. above the bottom of the horizontal graphite bars. The peak epithermal flux (E > 0.876 eV) is about 1. This gives a peak total flux of 2. The higher-energy fluxes, as determined by (n,p) reactions with ^58Ni and ^54Fe, peak at essentially the same position.

The gamma radiation levels in the reactor cell and drain-tank cell are indicated by six radiation monitors; three in each cell. Readings are taken routinely on each 8-hour shift. The source of the radiation that affects the monitors is very complex.

Great interest in the fission product behavior in the MSRE led to a study being launched to extract as much useful information as possible from the in-cell gamma radiation data. This study will supplement the other observations of gamma-ray spectra after shutdown and the activities in samples.

The sharp increase in activity in the drain tank cell near the end of the power run (March 20) was due to pressure-pulse experiments in the reactor system. The reactor off-gas was routed through one of the drain tanks and the drain tank vent system instead of the normal reactor off-gas system. This gives some indication of the intensity of the off-gas.

The decay of the radiation level in the reactor cell was not strongly affected either by the presence or absence of the fuel salt (drained on March 25) or by the first flushing operation (drained on March 29). The flush salt itself apparently provided some shielding while it was in the fuel loop.

Especially during the first month after shutdown, the rate of decay was greater in the reactor cell than in the drain-tank cell. This may indicate that some fission products with intermediate half-lives remained in the fuel or off-gas system rather than with the fuel.

Operation with 35U spanned 34 months, from May 1965 to March 1968, during which time fuel salt was in the core a total of 13,487 hr. There were 29 unscheduled rod scrams while fuel was in the core, but not one was caused by a process variable actually reaching a safety trip point.

A considerable improvement with time is evident from Table 1. 7. The rash of six scrams attributed to instrumentation and controls in the second quarter of 1966 was due to several sources of noise in the signals. Of the three scrams attributed to other causes, one was caused by a momentary voltage sag that tripped the safety channels; one was a manual scram to investigate a fire alarm (false), and one occurred when an electrical short tripped a power breaker in the reactor area. Power failure refers to an interruption of electrical power to the reactor area.

The accumulated thermal cycle history of the various components sensitive to thermal cycle damage is presented in Table 1. 8. Around 73% of the design thermal cycle life of the fuel system freeze flanges has been utilized so far. This contrasts with a figure of 69% at the conclusion of the previous report period and 63% at the start of run 14 a year ago.

During the previous operation of the MSRE, the heat balance power and the heat transfer performance were calculated using a coolant-salt specific heat that was temperature-dependent. Analysis of the MSRE operating data strongly suggested, however, that the specific heat was actually a constant. This was confirmed by a recent series of enthalpy measurements which gave a specific heat of 0.577 Btu/lb°F, which had been used for the average value over.

The main heat exchanger and radiator have been reevaluated, using the past temperature data and the new specific heat. The results of the heat exchanger evaluation are shown in Figure 14.

The increased value of the specific heat has also increased the measured overall heat transfer coefficient of the radiator from 38.5 to 42.75 Btu/hr-ft-°F. This is still below the corrected design value of 51.5 Btu/hr-ft-°F, which is dependent mainly on the airside film coefficient. The radiator is also continuing at its original performance level.

Fuel Sampler-Enricher. During the report period, the sampler-enricher was used for 12 sampling operations, bringing the total to 361 samples and 114 salt additions. The 12 operations successfully obtained four 10-g samples in freeze-valve capsules. One attempt to take a 10-g sample ended in the capsule being dropped into the pump bowl.

On the sampling attempt that resulted in the sampler cable becoming tangled, there was no sign of trouble as the cable was unreeled the usual 17 ft 5 in. As it was being rewound, the motor stalled with 13 ft 5 in. off the reel. A few attempts to unreel and rewind convinced us that the cable was tangled in the isolation chamber as it had been on previous occasions.

When the access door was opened after the fuel salt was drained, the capsule was visible through the lower corner of the port opening, and the latch could be seen in the back of the chamber. There were many loops and coils of cable. Evidently, the capsule and latch had never left the isolation chamber on its way down at the start of sampling. The reason for the capsule hanging cannot be ascertained. When the operator had closed the door, the capsule appeared to be hanging normally.

Some of the drive cable loops extended down into the sampler tube, and rather than risk cutting the cable, we left the isolation valves open. As an attempt was made to lift the capsule out of the isolation chamber, the manipulator fingers brushed.

Some of the coils, causing them to spring out through the access port and pull the capsule cable from the manipulator jaws. The capsule dropped into the sampler tube bottom up; the latch tipped over, releasing the key, and the capsule and key disappeared down the tube.

Although it appeared that the capsule had fallen with the magnetic top underneath, immediate attempts were made to retrieve it using magnets. A 6 x 6 in. magnet was lowered into the pump bowl without success. A 4 x 5 in. magnet was lowered but came up clinging to the latch. A 4 x 5 in. magnet with a copper tube around the cable to hold the magnet off the latch was lowered but could not be worked past the magnetic obstruction where the sampler tube penetrated the wall of the reactor.

After the loop was filled with fresh salt, a 50g capsule was lowered into the pump bowl. It came up empty, and salt droplets clinging to the upper sides showed it had been only half submerged, presumably because it had come to rest on the dropped capsule inside the cage. A 10g capsule was submerged and collected a sample.

A full-size mockup of the sampler tube and the pump bowl internals was constructed to test magnets and other types of retrieval tools. Two capsules, one without cable and key, and the other with, were dropped in the mockup to simulate the capsules lost in August 7 and March 1968. The most probable configuration of the capsules: simple and most reliable tool proved to be an Alnico 5. Both capsules' retrieval was successful except.

Because the actual recovery had to be attempted blind, a speaker connected to the microphone on the pump bowl was used to listen in on the grappling. The 4-inch magnet was lowered into the pump bowl, and sounds were heard indicating that an object was being lifted a few inches and then.

Came up with a lump attached, which later proved to be the corroded top of the old capsule. The ½-inch magnet was, after some difficulty with the magnetic penetration, also lowered into the pump bowl. There was never any indication that the ½-inch magnet picked up anything. Further mockup work convinced us that the second capsule had gotten outside the cage, where it could be reached by the ½-inch magnet but not by the ⅜-inch.

Several types of dislodging tools were tried in the mockup. Two tools proved capable of moving the capsules; however, more often than not, the capsules were shifted so as to make retrieval more difficult rather than easier. Therefore, no attempt was made to use these tools in the pump bowl.

When the fuel system was next filled with flush salt in August, a 10 g sample was obtained, but a 50 g capsule came up empty. It appeared to have been submerged slightly over halfway. New windows were cut in two 50 g capsules, and samples containing 25 g of salt were obtained.

An unexpected difficulty arose during the first few sampling operations. The drive stalled with about 3 ft of cable still out, but after a few minutes, it rewound freely. Inspection of the cable showed no abnormality. It was concluded that the problem was a temperature effect on the drive. In this sampler, the cable extends well down into the high-temperature region in the fuel storage tank. There is no pause for freezing as in the other salt samplers since the tube goes straight down. We suspected that the length of the hot cable caused the drive gears to heat up and bind. A cooling period added to the procedure alleviated the problem.

The control rods and drives operated in a satisfactory manner throughout run 14. After the shutdown in March, the No. 2 drive was removed to replace the fine synchro position indicator, which had failed in January. It was found that the wiper leads were burned off at the slides. A limit switch, which began malfunctioning after the drive was removed, was also replaced. While the drive was out, the No. 2 rod was pulled up and inspected installed. The No. 1 and No.

The system provides an indication of hydrocarbon content by sending the stream through a heated copper oxide bed, which converts the hydrocarbons to water and carbon dioxide, through one side of a thermal conductivity cell, through an absorber to take out the H2O and CO2, then back through the other side of the conductivity cell. The difference in thermal conductivity is a measure of the hydrocarbon content. When the fuel off-gas was sent through this route, the indication was that there were more impurities in the helium after the absorber than there were ahead of it. The diagnosis was radiation decomposition of the wet magnesium perchlorate absorber material. Plans were made to change the absorber unit to one containing dry molecular sieve, after tests of this material showed no significant decomposition to 107 rads.

The other thermal conductivity cell compares the conductivity of a reference stream of pure helium with that of off-gas, which may have gone through the hydrocarbon system or not. The reading is a measure of the total contaminants at that point. It is not unambiguous because the conductivity effect varies with the identity of the contaminant. After the power was lowered to 10 kW, the reading decreased to 52% of the full-power value. The fuel salt was drained, and flush salt was added. Three hours after flush-salt circulation started, the gas contaminant reading was 16 times that at full-power value and leveled out there for several hours. After the flush salt was drained, helium was circulated in the fuel loop at 5 psig, with the normal 4 liters/min flow to the off-gas.

System. A contaminant level 100 times the full power value was observed. After the fuel system was vented and repressurized, the reading was still 50 times full power (about 0. 5% impurities in the gas). By this time, the radiation level was relatively low, so the hydrocarbon system was valved in. The hydrocarbon indication was low, and the other reading changed little, implying that the high reading was not due to hydrocarbons. The inference was drawn that fission products were coming off into the off-gas from the bare surfaces in the fuel system.

The restriction in the off-gas line near the fuel pump that had been detected earlier gave no trouble in the last weeks of operation, but there were indications that it was still there. Nine days after the fuel was drained, the flexible section of the off-gas line was removed, and a flexible tool was run through the 28 in. of line back to the pump bowl. The tool, a 44-in. cable with a diamond drill tip, encountered some resistance at first and came out with a considerable amount of solids on it (see Chap. 17). The flexible jumper and the line downstream did not appear to be restricted. After the new jumper was in place, flow-pressure drop measurements showed no evidence of any.

The replacement jumper line was equipped with four thermocouples to provide more information during power operation. In addition, a slender basket was suspended in the entrance of the 4-inch off-gas holdup pipe. In it were devices of metal and graphite to collect material from the off-gas stream for future study.

The two main blowers, MB-1 and MB-3, continued to operate without difficulty throughout run 14 and have accumulated 7800 and 7125 hours of operating time since they were rebuilt. Both blowers were disassembled for their routine annual inspection, and the rear bearings were replaced on the basis of the grease appearance.

The thrust bearing of MB-3 was also replaced because of a heavy thumping noise accompanied by a shaft displacement that occurred when the rotor was turned by hand. The difficulty was found to be a relatively large misalignment between the rotor shaft and the outer race of the bearing. Otherwise, the bearing had been in good condition. The bearing is mounted in a spherical self-aligning mount, but the friction forces are apparently too high for the mount to be effective. The MB-3 replacement bearing and the MB-1 bearing were, therefore, aligned manually. In other respects, both blowers were in good condition, and there was no evidence of cracking in the hubs or blading.

By the end of run 14, heater units HX-1 and HX-2 on the primary heat exchanger were inoperative because of open leads. These two units were removed from the reactor cell early in the shutdown (on the fourth and fifth day after the end of full-power operation) to see if repairs were possible or if replacement units would be required. The trouble was found in the junction boxes mounted on top of the heaters, where the lead wires from several of the heater elements had burned in two at their screwed connections to the terminal strips. Repair was complicated by the induced activity in the assemblies, which produced a gamma radiation field of about 3 r/hr at 1 ft. A temporary work shield was set up, having concrete block walls and a top of steel plate and lead block, with a small opening in the top through which direct maintenance on the junction box was feasible. The terminal strips and connections were severely oxidized, apparently due to high temperatures during operation. The situation was corrected by installing nickel terminal strips and welding the heater leads directly to them. The copper wire from the terminal strip to the disconnect was also replaced with No. 12 nickel wire welded to the terminal strip.

Although the fuel and coolant salt pumps were shut off and at ambient temperature during most of this report period, the lubricating oil systems for both salt pumps operated continuously and without incident. The only problem was the recurring gradual fouling of the water side of the cooling coils on the oil reservoir. Switching to process water for a few weeks seems to clear the coils to the extent that tower water again provides.

As expected, there was no shaft seal oil leakage during shutdown; however, on startup of both salt pumps in August, the shaft seal leakages resumed at the same rates as those that had existed before the March shutdown, namely 6 cc/day for the fuel pump and 20 cc/day for the coolant pump.

Component cooling pump No. 2 (CCP-2) was in service continuously for the last 3886 hours of run 14 after CCP-1 was shut down because of loss of oil from its lubrication system. After run 14, the belt on CCP-2 was found to be quite loose, worn, and severely cracked. Belts and check-valve flappers were replaced on both units.

During the initial run-in of the new belts, excessive oil bypass and low air output were noted. These were corrected by tightening the oil relief valves and the air pressure relief valves. After resumption of operation in August, both component cooling pumps operated satisfactorily, although CCP-2 oil pressure was slightly low.

While the blowers were down for maintenance, the gates on the isolation valves were inspected because excessive leakage had been experienced. Several large pits were found in the gate of the valve in the CCP-2 discharge line. The pits appeared to have been casting defects that had been repaired earlier with epoxy. Repairs were made by laying down stainless steel with a metallizing gun and remachining. The air leakage through this valve was reduced from over 100 scf/day to 0. 5 scf/day at a pressure differential.

Out of about 160 valves, only 11 had leak rates that exceeded prescribed limits: 3 in the cover gas system, 4 in the water system, and 4 air or nitrogen block valves. Dirt or debris on the seat was the predominant cause of leakage. All valves were satisfactory after servicing.

Release of the beta-gamma activity through the stack amounted to 343 mc during the six-month report period. Of this, 193 mc was released during the week in which the off-gas line was open in the reactor cell for reaming. The release of radioiodine during the report period was quite negligible, amounting to less than 0. 3 me.

Operation of the freeze-flange thermal-cycle test, which had been resumed at 103 cycles, was continued through 268 cycles; at that point, it was shut down for inspection of the flanges and for minor repairs. There was no indication during the operation of any changes in the flanges. However, there were several minor operational problems of interest.

The accumulated downtime was due almost entirely to shorted level probes. Fifteen shorts occurred during the 165 cycles, and after each one, it was necessary to shut down to clean the probe. After a filament transformer was placed in the probe circuit and connected to the secondary mer, there were only three periods of difficulties with shorted probes.

Solenoid valves. We have found that by adjusting the timers so that, during the oscillation period, argon is supplied as a pressurizing gas for 10 minutes, and then helium is supplied for 2 minutes, the desired operating temperatures could be maintained with a reduction in the usage of bottled helium.

Upon disassembly of the flanges, we found that the thermocouples at the flange bore had failed to indicate the temperature of the salt instead of the metal surface. However, examination of temperatures from thermocouples located on the outside of the flanges gave confidence that the flange had been subjected to the proper thermal cycle. The bore thermocouples were replaced.

When the flanges were disassembled, the oval ring gasket with the stainless steel insert screen was removed and inspected. The average diameter of the frozen salt cake on the screen was 10 inches. At the end of the first 103 cycles, the diameter had been 11 inches. Higher flange temperatures accompanying some of the earlier tests would account.

A dye-penetrant inspection of the inner flange face and bore of both flanges was made. We found that the female flange was intact and crack-free both in the bore and on the flange. The face of the male flange was also crack-free, but the dye penetrant indicated a crack in the flange bore, as shown in Figure 1. The crack extended circumferentially about 90 to 110° clockwise around the bore starting from the top vertical centerline. Although not evident in Figure 1, the penetrant also indicated a band of porosity starting at the crack and extending about 1% in. farther into the bore. The porosity band followed the crack.

Reassembly of the flange was completed in preparation for the resumption of the test. Except for more frequent inspection, the test procedure will not be changed. The exterior of the flanges will be inspected visually during and after each cycle, and the inner flange faces and bores will be examined at the end of each 50 cycles. The test will be extended to determine the number of thermal cycles a flange of this design can be subjected to before failure.

Shortly after the shutdown in March, a series of gamma-spectrometric measurements were made of fission products that had deposited on the metal surfaces in the fuel system. This work was an extension, with improved equipment, of a similar scan of the fuel heat exchanger in May 1967. Other means include the total gamma radiation in the reactor and drain and cover gas, specimens of metal and graphite from the center of the core (Sect. 18. 1), and material from the fuel off-gas line (Sect. 17).

The measurements were made by combining the laboratory technique of gamma spectroscopy with the equipment and shielding developed for maintenance of the highly radioactive MSRE components. A lithium-drifted germanium diode detector, mounted in a highly collimated gamma beam, was coupled to a 400-channel analyzer through appropriate amplifiers. The detector-collimator assembly was mounted on and shielded by the portable maintenance shield, which also served as a carriage to move the detector to various positions over the reactor components. The mechanical arrangement used is shown in Fig.

Where CR is the area under the peak expressed as counts per second, t is the decay time from reactor shutdown to the measurement time; A is the decay constant of the specified radionuclide (or the controlling precursor); B is the branching ratio of the measured gamma ray (photons emitted per disintegration); F is the counting efficiency; AF (area factor) is the number of square inches of metal surface with deposited isotopes per square inch of area normal to the axis of the detector, and the factor 3.7 x 10^10 converts the result to curies. The absorber factor AB describes the attenuation between the source and the detector: for the pump bowl and piping, point-source slab-shield approximations were used. In the heat exchanger, the calculation of AB took into account the details of.

During the period from 3 to 17 days after shutdown, the apparatus was set up over the primary heat exchanger, the pump bowl, the off-gas system pipeline (line 522), and the primary loop piping (lines 101 and 102). Some results from these measurements are summarized in Table 2.1. Five nuclides are seen to be predominant in the heat. Daughter 137CsZr, the precursor of 88Nb, was not detectable. Also significant is the fact that 8-day 131I (which has a short-lived tellurium precursor) was not detectable in the heat exchanger, although short-lived 137Cs was. Table 2.1 also shows the relatively large amounts of some of the radionuclides in the pump bowl and the off-gas line. Although it was generally higher near the inlet of the heat exchanger than downstream, there was not a uniform gradient. (Splotchy is a more descriptive term).

In conjunction with the gamma spectrometric measurements described in the preceding section, gamma-ray sources were mapped by pinhole camera photography. Film sensitive to both X-rays and visible light (Kodak type KK) was used in the lead pinhole camera described.

The taking of photographs was a rather simple procedure. The camera was placed in the maintenance shield, pointing straight down. The shield was then maneuvered to place the camera directly above the area to be photographed. Since there was no shutter on the camera, a sheet-film holder loaded with the proper film was inserted in the camera and removed after the desired exposure. When desired, visible-light exposure could be made shorter than the x-ray exposure by replacing the holder slide partway through the process.

Some typical examples of the different photographs that were made are 6, which looks down on the fuel pump and adjacent piping, and 7, which is a photograph of the gamma source in the portion of the heat exchanger visible to the camera. Note that what seems to be a corona around the source is actually a blurring of the image in the camera.

Promising, and we consider the technique worthy of further development and use. Deficiencies needing improvement are as follows: Gamma images were less sharp than desired, with hot spots being blurred. Exposure times for visible-light images were quite long, up to 45 minutes in some cases, due to the limited light intensity attainable in the cell. Finally, the arrangement for the camera did not permit tilting for shots other than vertical.

The preparation of the test facility for operation with salts was completed, and check-out of all systems neared completion. The initial assembly of the pump rotary element had excessive oil leakage from the shaft lower seal during cold shakedown to check the performance of the shaft bearings and seals. The lower seal rotor had a scratch across the seal face, which caused the leakage. Upon replacement of the seal rotor, the rotary element performed satisfactorily. The rotary element was installed in the test facility.

All 15 relays in the rod-scram coincidence matrix were replaced with relays designed for 32V DC operation. No more coil failures occurred, but three of the new relays failed due to contact welding. An investigation of this problem was launched. No other difficulties were experienced in the safety.

One of the single-point level probes in fuel drain tank 1 failed. The failure was found to be an open lead wire inside the cell. The probe was restored to service by a cross-connection outside the cell to the equivalent lead to the other probe.

The No.2 fission chamber was replaced. A review of the history of the chambers used in the wide-range counting channel indicates an average lifetime in the neighborhood of about three months. With the staggered failures that we have experienced, the installed spare is usable for any lower power or startup operation when a single channel fails.

Further additions and modifications were made to the instrumentation and control systems as experience revealed the need or desirability of more information for the operators, improved performance, or increased protection. During the report period, there were 75 design change requests directly involving instruments or controls. Eleven of these required.

Fuel Processing System. The instruments and controls for the fuel processing system were revised as a result of piping and equipment modifications. Temperature, pressure, and process radiation measuring instruments were provided for the new caustic scrubber, fume filter, the soda-lime trap, and the deep-bed charcoal trap. Two temperature recorders were provided to receive signals from additional sources.

To assure the delivery of fluorine gas at a constant pressure and to improve the control of flow into the fuel storage tank for a wider range of process conditions, a new control system for the fluorine gas supply was designed and installed. A safety shut-off valve was provided to close automatically if flow from the fluorine supply trailer became.

Contact microphones were attached to the exterior walls of the fuel storage tank and the caustic scrubber to transmit the process sounds inside the two vessels.

Theoretical analysis of neutron dynamics measurements, particularly those designed to help infer magnitudes of reactivity effects, depends on the proper interpretation of the delayed neutron behavior in the reactor. As a result of the efforts of many workers, well-developed theoretical and experimental foundations exist for the analysis of the most common reactor kinetics measurements. The usual practical effort involved in the analysis of any particular reactor is that of bridging the theoretical foundations and the experimental data with adequate numerical approximations.

An important characteristic of delayed neutrons that must be taken into account in interpreting kinetics experiments is their energies of emission, which are lower than those of the prompt neutrons from fission. In a thermal reactor, such as the MSRE, the net result of this difference in emission energy spectra is that the delayed neutrons have less likelihood of leakage to the surroundings than the prompt neutrons, so that their contribution to the chain reaction is enhanced. Thus, one is led.

The precursor group must be multiplied to obtain their contribution relative to the prompt neutrons in promoting the chain reaction. Chapter 6 of reference 1 contains an extensive discussion of the problem of calculating the delayed neutron effectiveness factors.

Measurements of the delayed neutron emission spectra have been made; sufficient uncertainties yet exist in the data to suggest that detailed calculations to take into account the shape of the delayed neutron energy spectra are not always warranted. For thermal reactors, in particular, one may obtain an adequate estimate of the corrections arising from these differences in energy spectra by assuming that all delayed neutrons are emitted with a single average energy, independent of the precursor group. According to data taken from ref. 1, this average energy is approximately 0.43 MeV.

The foregoing procedure is strictly applicable to reactors with fixed fuel. In application to the MSRE, additional complications arise from the motion of the precursors due to fuel circulation. The applications to the MSRE considered here are confined to measurements made with no circulation of the fuel. With qualifications depending on the accuracy required, the energy corrections calculated from the above formula may also be applied.

In the region of the channeled core and at a temperature of 1200°F, the age calculated for the prompt fission neutrons was 251. 9 μs. When calculated for both the U-235 fissile loading of the preceding MSRE runs and the new loading of U-234, these results were found to be very nearly independent of the fissile composition. Based on a geometric buckling corresponding to a cylinder 29" x 78" (R x H), the value of γ calculated from the total effective delayed neutron fraction for use in experimental measurements of reactivity effects for U-235 is 0.71%, compared with the absolute delay fraction of 0. 65%. The magnitude of this energy-effectiveness correction is higher than the correction obtained in earlier studies by a factor of 1. 05. This difference is not surprising; however, in view of the necessity in the earlier studies of using a less sophisticated computation of the difference in the average age of prompt and.

The upward revision of our calculated value of y has some interesting implications regarding the interpretation of reactivity measurements made with the 35U fuel loading. Since the magnitudes of reactivity inferred from these experiments are relative to the effective delayed neutron fraction, this would imply that all reactivity effects should be larger by a factor of approximately 1.05 than the values based on the earlier calculations of the energy correction. In the results reported in ref. 5, this would have the effect of increasing the difference between the experimental and calculated worths of the MSRE control rods but would tend to bring the measured isothermal temperature and 235U concentration coefficients of reactivity into better agreement with the calculated values.

The MSRE with 75U fuel will have a lower fraction of delayed neutrons, a larger negative temperature coefficient of reactivity, and a longer prompt neutron lifetime than when fueled with 235U. Each of these factors affects the dynamic behavior of the reactor. Because of these differences in important system parameters, an analysis was performed for the 75U-fueled MSRE to predict both the reactor time response and the frequency response to reactivity perturbations, and also to establish the linear stability of the system as described by the theoretical model. We did alter the model slightly to account for more mixing of the fuel salt during circulation. The experimental results of the earlier testing programs showed the desirability of this change.

In reactivity (0.02% 5k/k) is shown in 0.1 at various initial power levels. The response becomes less oscillatory, and the damping coefficient increases as the power level is increased. At the higher power levels, the power rises sharply after a step increase in reactivity, but the temperature effects in the core promptly counterbalance the reactivity input, and the power decreases toward its initial level. However, before returning to its initial level, the power levels out on a transient plateau. It stays at this level until ~17 sec after the reactivity perturbation, then it again begins to decrease. The power plateau is observed because a quasi-steady state exists in the core region. The inlet temperature is the same as it was before the perturbation, and the core nuclear average temperature has increased enough to compensate for the reactivity change. After ~17 sec (the transient time of the external loop), the return of higher-temperature salt increases the inlet temperature and introduces negative reactivity through the negative temperature coefficient.

The frequency response of a system is a good indicator of the dynamic response and stability of the system. Excellent agreement was obtained between the calculated and experimentally determined frequency response for the 235U fuel loading, and we have no reason to expect anything other than good agreement for the 53U fuel loading.

Curves showing the calculated power-to-reactivity frequency response for the 795U-fueled MSRE are shown in Fig. 2. Since a high peak implies a more oscillatory response, Fig. 2 shows that the system will be less oscillatory at higher power levels. The dip in the amplitude ratio curves at ~0.25 radian/sec corresponds to the fuel transit time of ~25 sec.

Calculations. However, the frequency response of any two system parameters may be calculated relative to each other, so long as the parameter appears in the system equations. Of most practical interest are the frequency-response calculations involving measurable quantities. The assumed temperature-sensing device is a thermocouple located on the outside of a pipe. Figure 4.3 also shows the response of the thermocouple-measured outlet temperature relative to power. The effect of assuming more salt mixing in the circulation loop is also shown.

A necessary and sufficient condition for linear asymptotic stability is that all the eigenvalues of the set of system equations have negative real parts. Several of the dominant eigenvalues (those closest to the imaginary axis) are shown in Table 4.1.

Component. Since there are a number of eigenvalues which have about the same amplitude, this damping ratio alone cannot be used to determine system response, but it does serve as a relative indicator of oscillatory behavior. From the € values, we must again conclude that the system is highly stable at high power levels and that it becomes.

The Mikhailov stability technique has recently been modified by Wright and Kerlin so that equations containing pure time-delay terms can be handled. The modifications also included amplitude and phase normalization so that the Mikhailov criterion is now valuable in stability analysis.

Frequency: If the tip of the vector makes any net encirclements of the origin as the frequency is varied from -∞ to +∞, the system is unstable. The vector motion is symmetric with respect to the frequency variable, so only the points corresponding to frequencies between 0 and +∞ need be plotted.

In the eigenvalue calculation of 1345, the accuracy of the computation prevented obtaining a solution exactly equal to zero. The calculated line actually crossed the real axis at +8.2 x 10^-8. From a practical standpoint, this must be recognized as zero.

We have continued the design studies of the single-fluid molten-salt breeder reactor described in our last semiannual progress report. Several significant changes were made in the design described there. One notable difference is the reduction in the capacity of the MSBR reference design plant from 2000 MW (electrical) to 1000 MW (electrical). Although the single-fluid MSBR concept is well-suited for larger sizes of reactors, and many of the performance factors and the power.

Another important modification of the design was our decision to replace graphite by removing the entire reactor core as a unit assembly rather than by withdrawing a few elements at a time, as had been assumed in all the previous concepts for the single-fluid MSBR. This required changes in the high-bay containment arrangement, as will be explained subsequently.

Other significant changes were made in the reactor and heat exchanger equipment, the flow sheets, and plant layouts. The majority of these revisions were brought about by refinements in the nuclear physics calculations, in the physical properties of the fuel and coolant salts, and in estimates of the afterheat and stress problems.

The dimensions of the cells are shown in Figs. Secondary drain tank cells are above grade. Double containment is provided for all the cells which normally contain radioactive materials. The reactor cell has thermal shielding at the cell wall to prevent overheating of the concrete biological shielding by incident radiation. The reinforced concrete structure at the top of the reactor cell was analyzed for stresses, and the maximum deflection of the 63 ft-diam slab was found to be acceptable under the fully loaded conditions.

A basic change in the layout is that the high-bay area over the reactor cell, storage cells, and core assembly and disassembly space is a separate containment area within the reactor plant confinement building. This provides an additional barrier to the escape of airborne radioactive particles.

We have changed the method of supporting the equipment in the reactor cell. It will now hang from the overhead structure rather than resting on pedestals on the cell floor. The supports are shown in Fig. 2. The reactor vessel closure seal is now in a lower-temperature, less radioactive environment. Each primary heat exchanger is hung from a pivot point near the center of the shell. This permits the shell to rotate slightly to accommodate the differential thermal expansion in the inlet and outlet primary salt lines.

And all values were found to be within the acceptable limits. We removed the expansion bellows previously shown in the secondary-salt lines for the 2000-MW (electrical) plant.

Most of the mass flow rates shown on the flowsheet are about one-half those shown in previous reports for a 2000-MW (electrical) MSBR plant. Some of the changes in the quantities shown are due to revisions in the salt physical property data. The properties now in use in the MSBR design studies are given in Table 5. 2. Some of the auxiliary systems not shown on previous flowsheets have also been included.

Made on the basis of new physical property data for the salts and on revised calculations, which indicate that the secondary salt can be returned to the primary heat exchangers at as low a temperature as 850°F without danger of freezing the primary salt, even though the latter has a liquidus temperature of about 930°F. This assumption is supported by the estimate of the film temperature drops and the tube wall resistance to heat transfer. The full-flow gas separator shown in the primary salt line on previous flowsheets has been eliminated. We now pass only about 10% of the salt flow through a gas separator. The stripped gases and entrained salt are then passed through an entrainment separator, the collected salt being returned to the pump bowl. The purge gas from the pump bowl is also freed of salt in this same entrainment separator. A holdup tank is provided in the off-gas line to cool the gas and to extract the metal and other decay product particulates. A fluid, possibly liquid bismuth, is sprayed into the holdup tank in direct contact with the off-gas. This fluid is circulated in a closed loop consisting of the holdup tank, pump, heat exchanger, and chemical processing system for cleanup.

The basic design of the reactor for a single-fluid MSBR is for the fuel salt to move upward in single-pass flow through graphite moderator prisms, or elements, mounted vertically in a Hastelloy N tank. Although simple in concept, much of the MSBR design study effort has been spent investigating the many possible arrangements to approach an optimum configuration. There have been numerous refinements to the design concept as more information became available on graphite behavior, salt properties, nuclear performance, and on heat transfer and stress conditions.

We no longer use a permanently installed metal grid for locating the moderator prisms within the core. It was possible to eliminate the grid when we decided to remove and replace the core graphite as a unit rather than by individual or small groups of elements. A core basket is now used to retain the graphite. The basket can be preassembled by direct approach, and a jig would assure correct alignment of the prisms. When the peripheral region of the core is filled with the graphite spheres, as will be discussed subsequently, the core graphite will be held in position, and the assembly jig can be removed. The basket is installed inside the reactor.

The graphite rests on the bottom of the core retainer basket when the reactor is drained of salt, and bears against the top head when the vessel is filled. The prisms are tapered at the top, which, together with a molded extension, provides a flow passage across the top of the graphite for the leaving fuel salt. This arrangement gives a high fuel-to-graphite ratio region at the top of the reactor to act as an undermoderated "blanket. " The molded extension also allows for orificing the center holes in the elements and in the interstices to approach a uniform temperature rise of the fuel salt over the entire cross-sectional flow area of the core. Reactor performance was, of course, improved by the elimination of the metallic grid work which acted as a nuclear poison.

Physics calculations to optimize the nuclear performance and to determine the salt fractions and the exact shape of the salt flow passages are not yet finalized. The elements are approximately 4 inches square with projections on each face and a central hole about 0. 6 inches in diameter to form the salt flow channels. The flow channels between the elements are about 0. 4 inches wide, and all the flow passages have equal hydraulic diameters. When assembled in a square array, the 1248 prisms form an octagonal matrix, as shown in Fig. 5. 5. With this particular configuration, about 16% of the core volume will be salt, but the dimensions can be adjusted to provide the salt fraction specified from the physics analysis. The absence of sharp corners on the elements will facilitate fabrication by extrusion, and the flat surface at the points of contact of a rib with an adjacent element will permit relative movement without damage.

Hydraulic analyses indicate that the pressure drop of the salt in flowing through the moderator is about 34 psi along the axial center line of the reactor core. This estimate is based on a 92 W/cc maximum core power density and a 250°F temperature rise of the salt in passing through the core and will have to be adjusted to conform to the final design values. At other radial locations in the core, the flow rates are necessarily less in order to produce the desired 250°F rise. As mentioned previously, the additional pressure drop needed at these locations to produce a total Δp of 34 psi.

The peripheral space between the octagonal-shaped core and the cylindrical walls of the basket serves a dual purpose. The fuel-to-graphite ratio is higher in this volume, and, by being undermoderated, there is a much lower fission rate, and the leakage of neutrons from the core is substantially reduced. Secondly, the balls are buoyant in the salt and exert a radial pressure tending to keep the core elements compacted. A hold-down plate is provided at the top of the core to keep the balls in place and to introduce high resistance to salt flow through the ball region. The bulk of the salt entering this space will move radially inward into the active core region in its transit through the reactor. The flow in the blanket region is estimated to be only about 10% of the total salt mass flow.

The new arrangement provides for the removal of the core as a unit assembly rather than by the withdrawal of a few graphite elements at a time. We plan to use a spare top head assembly and a core basket for the replacement operation. The spent core would first be drawn up into a transport cask, moved laterally, and lowered into the spent core cell for decay and disposal. The spare head and the core, which had been previously assembled by direct approach under shop conditions, would be standing by, and the substitution could be made relatively quickly. This maintenance arrangement is believed to require less capital investment and downtime.

The core basket is a complete assembly containing the core elements, the blanket spheres, and the reflector graphite. The dished bottom of the basket is about 2 in. thick and has a central inlet opening for the salt. A flat plate is located about 10 in. above the opening to support the central graphite when the vessel is empty. The cylindrical shell of the basket has a y-in. clearance between it and the vessel wall to allow an upward flow of fuel salt for vessel cooling. Eight 2-in.

The reactor tank is a Hastelloy N vessel about 18 ft in diameter and 16 ft high at the centerline of the two dished heads. The wall thickness of the top dished head is 2 inches thick, but it also has a 2-inch-thick thermal shield on the inside to reduce the neutron fluence and ensure that radiation damage in this high-temperature region will be within allowable limits. As seen in Figure 6, the top head is attached through a forging to a 9-ft-high cylindrical extension, which carries a flange at the top to mate with the upper flange on the extended wall of the reactor vessel. This arrangement allows the vessel closure to be more accessible and in a zone that has lower temperature and less radioactivity. The flanges have double metal gaskets to effect a gas-tight seal and to provide a space for leak detection. These gaskets would be replaced each time a new reactor core is installed. The upper flanges rest on the structure near the top of the cell and support the entire reactor vessel assembly.

Preliminary calculations indicate that the stresses in the reactor vessel heads and walls are within the allowable limits. We have also investigated the effect of the neutron fluence on the design life of the plant. While it appears that the conditions are acceptable, if further refinements show that modifications are necessary, thermal shields can be used to bring the doses to within tolerable levels. We are presently showing a thermal shield for the top head, since this is the highest temperature region in the reactor. The rods have a function that is primarily.

Number of units: 4 Heat transferred in each unit, Mw: 563 Mass flow rate primary salt: 107 lb/hr Mass flow rate secondary salt: 107 lb/hr Primary salt temperature in, °F: 1300 Primary salt temperature out, °F: 1050 Secondary salt temperature in, °F: 850 Secondary salt temperature out, °F: 1150 Tube diameter, in.

Primary salt circulates in single-pass flow inside the tubes from top to bottom of the exchanger. Wall thickness, approximately 20 ft long, in each of the four exchangers. The secondary salt flows on the shell side from bottom to top through disk and doughnut baffles. In order to minimize the fuel salt volume in the exchangers, we propose to use a special tubing. The tubes are knurled to produce shallow, spiraled convolutions along the length. This treatment has been found in tests with water to be effective in increasing the overall heat transfer coefficient, although at the expense of an increased pressure drop.

We completed an optimization code for calculating the performance of the heat exchangers. Full utilization of the code awaited reliable physical property data for the salts, but recently available values will make it possible to optimize the heat exchanger design. The heat exchanger data listed in Table 5. 3 are based on the new salt properties given in Table 5. 1 and are the initial result of use of the new code. Further refinements and revisions will probably be required when the vibration and stress studies are complete, and some of the numbers may need adjustment.

The tubing for the primary exchangers would be fabricated and installed under strict quality control conditions, and past experience indicates that a high degree of reliability could be achieved. To take care of the possibility of tube failure, however, after studying the maintenance aspects, we decided to design on the basis of removal of an entire tube bundle rather than to attempt to repair individual tubes in the highly radioactive environment. The heat exchanger shells and connecting piping would be permanently installed; although these could be replaced by non-routine remote maintenance techniques in the unlikely event that this need arose.

A heat exchanger tube bundle consists of tubes running vertically between the upper and lower tube sheets. As shown in Fig. 8, the top sheet has a hole in the center through which the secondary salt downcomer passes. A flanged joint at one end of this central pipe and a slip joint at the other permit removal of the bundle. The tube bundle is clamped onto a ring at the top of the shell in order to resist the hydraulic forces due to salt flow. A seal weld is made around the clamped joint to ensure separation of the primary and secondary salt circuits when removing a tube.

One drain tank, about 13 ft in diameter x 20 ft high, provides storage volume for the approximately 1500 ft of salt in the primary circulating system. The general features of the tank are much as described in a previous report, although the dimensions and heat transfer area require revisions because the plant design capacity is now 1000 MW (electrical). These changes are in progress.

The natural convection cooling system for the drain tank was also described previously. There, the heat is transferred to the ambient air. A system of dampers and heaters would prevent the drain tank coolant salt from freezing when it is not required to transport the heat. Again, the features of the system remain essentially unchanged, but revisions are needed. A very preliminary analysis of the heat transfer coefficient between the primary salt in the tank and the circulating coolant salt in the thimbles indicates that it is on the order of 50 Btu/hr-ft-°F rather than the higher value previously reported.

The arrangement of the drain line is schematically as indicated on the flowsheet. The drain line connects to the bottom (inlet) plenum of the reactor vessel, and the drain valve is located about 14 ft downstream from this connection. Since the salt in the drain line must be circulated to prevent excessive self-heating, a connection has been provided just upstream of the freeze valve to a manifold connecting the tanks of each of the four primary pumps. Salt is flowing through this line.

The drain valve is the frozen salt type and has not yet been studied in detail. There is a background of satisfactory experience with freeze valves in the MSRE, however. A gas-cooling system will be used for freezing the plug in the valve and for keeping it frozen. When a drain is to be made, hot rather than cool gas will be supplied.

The catch basin, or pan, referred to above is in our present thinking connected to the drain tank through a U-tube trap. This trap is filled with molten bismuth, which under normal conditions serves as a seal between the drain tank contents and the reactor cell volume. If primary salt is spilled into the catch basin, the accumulated head of salt in the line would displace the bismuth from the U-tube and allow the salt to flow into the drain tank. A catch tank is located downstream from the U-tube to trap the bismuth and prevent it from entering the tank along with the salt. A mechanical valve is provided between the U-trap and the drain tank so that the vessel can be pressurized for transfer of the primary salt from the tank. This valve would not contact the salt except in the unlikely event of an accidental spill. It is within the current technology to fabricate a valve for such service.

It is estimated that ten days after reactor shutdown, the heat generation in the spent core would be about 240 kW (thermal). This amount of heat could be dissipated without the need for cooling of the core when in transit. The radiation level on the surface of the shielded transport cask would be reduced to less than 1000 R/hr. How much less remains to be.

The procedure for replacing the reactor moderator is tentatively visualized as follows: During reactor cooldown, the replacement core assembly is readied. The upper shielding blocks are then removed from the cell, and the reactor closure is unbolted. The building crane then places the transition pieces over the reactor cell and the spent core cells.

Engaged with the reactor vessel head and its connected core basket assembly. After all personnel have withdrawn to a shielded maintenance control room, the spent core is drawn up into the cask. The slide openings on the transition piece and cask are then closed. The replacement top head and core assembly are then raised into the cask; the cask is again sealed to the reactor cell transition piece, the slides are opened, and the assembly is lowered partway into the reactor vessel. After the cask and transition pieces are returned to their storage areas at the end of the reactor plant, the vessel closure can be completed, and the shielding blocks replaced.

A substantial portion of the physics work on the MSBR since the last progress report was devoted to developing improved computational tools. The code previously used was deficient for two principal reasons: (1) it could not accommodate multiple thermal-neutron energy groups, and (2) it was constrained to use the same spectrum-averaged cross sections of any one nuclide in all regions of the reactor.

Both of these limitations have now been removed (Reactor Optimum Design). A number of other improvements have also been incorporated in ROD; the most important of which is in the treatment of two-dimensional neutronic effects (e. g. , in R-Z geometry) by synthesizing two one-dimensional.

A new optimization calculation of the MSBR has been performed with ROD using five epithermal energy groups and four thermal groups. Furthermore, in this calculation, each region of the reactor has been assigned to it a set of cross sections appropriate to the neutron spectrum in that region.

Processing cycle times were specified to limit processing cost. A minimum of constraints was imposed on the calculation; any or all of which may ultimately be removed. The reactor was permitted only two salt fractions, one in the core and one in the blanket. The salt fraction in the axial blanket was fixed at 0. 85. All salt fractions except the axial blanket fraction were optimized. All dimensions were optimized. The primary salt contained approximately 16 mole % BeF3, 12 mole %.

Table 6. 1. Performance of a Single-Fluid, Two-Region, 1000-MW (electrical) MSBR Core height, ft: 11 Core diameter, ft: 11 Radial blanket thickness, ft: 2. 6 Radial reflector thickness, ft: 1. 5 Core salt fraction: 0. 145 Radial blanket salt fraction: 0. 85 Reactor power, MW (thermal): 2250 Average reactor power density: 29 W/cm Maximum power density: 108 kW/liter Graphite replacement life, years: 1. 8 Specific fuel inventory, kg/MW (electrical): 1.

The results of the calculation are shown in Table 6.1. It appears that a breeding ratio of 1.077, a yield of 4.1%, and a graphite lifetime of 1.8 years are achievable with this design. Small spatial variations in core composition, not yet included in this calculation, should appreciably flatten the power distribution in the core, reduce the peak damage flux, and increase the graphite.

Survey calculations were performed early in the report period using OPTIMERC to investigate the nuclear performance of a single-fluid MSBR with graphite balls as a moderator in both the core. It was noted that the OPTIMERC calculation, as applied in these cases, overestimates the breeding ratio by as much as 0. 01 and hence overestimates the yield also. This results primarily from the neglect of axial neutron leakage. This defect was not present in calculations of the two-fluid MSBRs reported earlier, nor is it present in the ROD calculations.

In all cases listed in Table 6.2, the reactor power is 1000 MW (electrical). The blanket contains 37% salt by volume. The reactor performance is optimized with respect to annual fuel yield, except that constraints are imposed on fuel processing rates (50 days cycle for rare-earth removal, 3 days for the removal of 3% Pa) in order to keep processing cost at a reasonable level. Cases 1 through 3 show the influence of ThF, mole % on the performance of a reactor with a random-packed bed of uniform graphite balls in the core and a salt fraction of 0.37. 16 and which corresponds to a reactor containing the optimum salt fraction (achievable with prismatic).

Case 4 corresponds to a reactor with an oriented bed of balls in the core and a random-packed bed in the blanket. Oriented packing of the core improves the performance of the reactor because of the more nearly optimum salt fraction (~0.27). The oriented bed does not appear feasible since the balls would tend to become disoriented during.

In cases 10 through 13, the graphite density in the blanket was reduced with the objective of hardening the blanket spectrum; hence, decreasing neutron production (and leakage) and increasing resonance capture in the blanket thorium. Comparison of case 13 with case 8 shows that this device improves the yield by ~4%.

Power density (per unit volume of core) and the maximum fast damage flux (E > 50 keV) obtainable are listed in Table 6.3. All cases were normalized to 100 MW (thermal). The salt contained 12-14 mol%. The breeding ratio reported is the value at start-of-life conditions, assuming pure 733 as fuel. Thus, for example, no allowance is made for fission product or protactinium losses. The reactors were unreflected, with the exception of case 10, which had a 1-ft-thick graphite reflector. In all cases.

On the other hand, cases 15 through 20 show that a somewhat higher-power reactor (about 175 to 200 MW (thermal)) can achieve the same peak damage flux and power density as a large MSBR; a breeding ratio greater than unity; and a core power fraction of at least 0. 5.

Noble gas migration in a conceptual version of the two-fluid MSBR was discussed in some detail in a previous progress report. The concept of using circulating helium bubbles for stripping noble gases from the fuel salt was presented. At that time, all the bubbles were injected into the fuel salt at the core outlet and removed from the salt at the core inlet. The objective was to keep the core nominally free of bubbles and to avoid any effects that they might have on reactivity. A recent change in ground rules allows up to 1% bubbles by volume of salt in the core. This greatly simplified the noble gas stripping problem because we can now recirculate the bubbles many times around the fuel loop and let them approach much closer to saturation. The result is that the volumetric flow rate of helium in the gas system is considerably reduced. Also, the bubble-generating and removal equipment may be put into a side stream rather than in the main line of the fuel loop.

Xenon-135 poisoning calculations have been made for the single-fluid MSBR reference design described in a preceding section and include the recirculating bubble concept described above. The analytical model used is that of a well-stirred pot; that is, the concentration of xenon dissolved in salt and in the bubbles is taken to be constant around the entire fuel loop. Figure 7.1 shows the effect of the amount of helium bubble recirculation on 135Xe poison fraction. The other variable parameter on this plot is the average void percent of bubbles in.

The fuel loop, which is almost exactly equal to the average void percent in the core, bubble surface areas are computed for bubbles 0. 020 inches in diameter. Other constant parameters are as listed in the figure legend. The graphite is taken to be uncoated.

Stripped from Fuel Loop per Cycle. Parameters: reactor power, 1000 MW (electrical); diffusion coefficient of Xe in graphite at 1200°F, 107 ft²/hr; graphite void fraction available to Xe, 10%; total yield of 135Xe, mass transfer coefficient to bubbles, 2.0 ft/hr.

And has a diffusion coefficient for xenon of 1075 ft²/hr at 1200°F (permeability for helium at room temperature ~10^5 cm/sec). From this plot, it can be seen that the fraction of bubbles stripped per loop cycle can be 10% or less before the back pressure of xenon in the bubble starts to significantly reduce the stripping efficiency. This means that for a given void fraction in the fuel salt, the bubbles can be recirculated ten times before they must be removed, and the capacity of the gas system will be 1/10 of that if all bubbles are replaced per cycle. As pointed out in the previous semiannual report, the mass transfer coefficient to circulating bubbles is one of the least-known parameters in this calculation.

A literature survey and analysis have been conducted on the expected mass transfer coefficient to the bubbles in a turbulent stream. For the rigid interface model, the expected value will be about 2.0 ft/hr. The above plot was computed using a value of 2.0 ft/hr. It is unlikely that a completely mobile interface will occur.

Exist with these very small bubbles, but a partially mobile interface may be realized. Now in these calculations, the variables bubble surface area and bubble mass transfer coefficient always appear as a product. Figure 7. In this plot, the average void percent bubbles in the fuel is used only to generate a surface area of 20-mil-diam bubbles and otherwise is a negligible parameter if the bubbles are far from saturation. The bubbles do not approach saturation until the fraction of bubbles stripped from the loop per cycle is less than 5.9% to 1.25% for the 10% bubble stripping fraction. It should also be noted that for a given void fraction, the bubble surface area is reduced by a factor of 2 if the bubble diameter is doubled.

Graphite: To develop this illustration, parameters were chosen from Fig. 7.1 to yield a high poison fraction (~1.9%). With these parameters, the calculations were repeated to obtain the effects of the permeability and thickness of the sealed layer on the poison fraction. In this calculation, it was assumed that the void fraction in graphite available to xenon decreased by one order of magnitude when the permeability decreased by two orders of magnitude.

The target 135Xe poison fraction in the MSBR is 7.1%; this may or may not be attainable. Some of the uncertainties are the bubble mass transfer coefficient, the ability to generate uniformly 0. 020-inch bubbles, and the ability of the bubbles to maintain their identity for many circuits around the fuel.

Circulating helium bubbles with the fuel salt is the preferred method of stripping noble gases generated by fission in the MSBR. Xenon-135 poisoning calculations reported above are based on surface areas generated by bubbles 0. 020 in. in diameter. We have conducted exploratory tests with water and air for some time to try to generate bubbles of this diameter with equipment that can be scaled up to sizes adequate for the MSBR. In general, two avenues of approach have been taken: (1) mechanically powered generators, where a mixture of air and water is fed to a mechanically agitating geometry that breaks up the large bubbles into very small ones, and (2) fluid-powered generators, where, for example, air is injected into the throat of a venturi. Without going into details of the several models tested, the following conclusions have.

Emphasis on mechanically powered generators should be reduced. During the early development work, smaller and more uniformly sized bubbles were attained by this method than with fluid-powered generators; however, other potential problems would be considerable.

A mechanical drive motor would be needed, but a separate drive motor would be undesirable. The most logical place to install a mechanical generator would be on the impeller of the pump. This complicates an already critical item; furthermore, estimates indicate that the most successful generator model tested would cavitate in MSBR-scaled equipment. A great deal of development work would be needed to successfully attach a mechanical bubble generator to a pump impeller.

Emphasis on the fluid-powered generator should be increased. The most successful fluid-powered bubble generator we have run is a venturi modified so that gas is injected into small holes in the throat, and turbulence in the diffuser region generates the bubbles. Quantitative information is not yet available; however, the bubbles appear to be larger than desired—on the order of 50 mils. It is hoped that further experimentation will reduce this. The venturi has the additional advantage that it could serve as the helium pump if it were placed on the suction side of the fuel pump.

Work is underway on the development of a pipeline bubble separator for the removal of noble gas bubbles from the fuel salt. The separator is a straight section of 4-inch pipe, about 4 ft long, with swirl vanes at the inlet end and recovery vanes at the outlet. The swirling fluid generates a high gravitational field in the pipe, and circulating bubbles will migrate to a gas-filled vortex in the center of the pipe. The recovery vanes straighten out the fluid and recover some of its energy. The gas takeoff is in the hub of the recovery vanes.

A full-scale model has been built and is operating in an existing water loop. A photograph of the separator operating in a Plexiglas pipe is shown in Fig. 3. Two sets of swirl vanes have been tested. The second set operates better than the first, and the results of this set only will be reported. Velocity profiles were measured in a radial direction and are shown in Fig. 4. Axial and tangential components are very nearly the same and are shown as a single line. It was also noted that there was very little attenuation of the velocity over the length between the vanes.

The only problem encountered is that the vortex does not attach to the hub of the recovery vanes. In earlier work done on pipeline gas separators, this phenomenon had not been experienced. The trouble is probably due to the hub size. It is planned to make a new set of vanes with the hub diameter doubled, which will be more in accordance with the separator of the earlier work.

Most of the downtime was due to removal and replacement of the pump rotary element and correction of gas-system plugging problems. The balance of the noncirculating time was spent on gas-system revisions, instrument calibrations, and correction of routine problems. No evidence of a leak was found, and the trouble was subsequently ascribed to shifting of inventory between the oil storage tank and the pump bearing.

The new charge of salt was added to the system in four batches. In order to remove adsorbed moisture, each batch was heated to 300°F and maintained under a vacuum (27 in. Hg) for at least 16 hours. The material was then heated to 1040°F, and if gas release, as measured by a pressure rise determination, was not excessive, transfer was made to the loop sump. Table 7.1 summarizes the data for this operation.

Speed at 1800 rpm. These tests are now being repeated with the new charge of salt. In a cavitation test, the flow and temperature are held constant, and the gas pressure in the pump gas space is lowered in steps until there is a disproportionate drop in pump discharge pressure per unit drop in pump suction pressure. For the flushing salt, the test results gave values for the minimum overpressure.

Cavitation tests with the new charge of salt are still in progress, but preliminary results are showing good agreement between predicted and test values for both the pressure at cavitation inception and the change of cavitation pressure with temperature. The lack of agreement in the case of the flushing salt may have been due to the higher level of impurities.

There are various restrictions in the gas system that can impact its efficiency and performance. One key limitation is the presence of contaminants in the gas, which can lead to corrosion and damage to the system components. Another restriction is the pressure drop that occurs as the gas flows through the system, which can affect the overall flow rate and delivery of gas to the intended destination. It is essential to identify and address these restrictions to ensure the smooth and reliable functioning of the gas system.

Analytical investigations are underway to identify the nature and source of all materials that have caused plugging problems. Aside from the predictable salt plugs caused by ingassing transients, difficulties with gas system restrictions were traced to three different materials.

Accumulations of fluid, brown to black in color and watery to syrupy in consistency, have been found in the off-gas line. This material appears to be a BF hydrolysis product, possibly due to moisture present in the loop at startup or brought in with the salt. Pressure-rise data during pretreatment (Table 7. 1) indicate that the new salt may have contained trace quantities of a volatile contaminant. The total amount of material has been relatively small (<100 cm³), and the rate of accumulation appears to be decreasing with time.

Deposits of a fine black powder have been found in both the off-gas line and gas feed lines. This material appears to be amorphous carbon, which collects as a scum on the surface of the salt in the pump bowl and is carried into the gas lines during ingassing transients. The source of the carbon is not clear, but there seems to be no direct relation to the NaBF4 salt.

When the pump was opened to check for oil leakage, pieces of green salt were found in the upper region of the pump bowl. The composition of the salt together with that of NaBF, and the BULT-4 salt previously used in the loop are shown in Table 7. 2. The significance of the green salt deposit has not as yet been determined, but there seems to be no adverse implication for the MSRE coolant system since the latter does not contain the two.

The performance of the drain-line freeze valve has been satisfactory through eight freeze and seven thaw cycles. This valve had been altered to simulate the characteristics of the MSRE-type valve. The preliminary conclusion is that, except for freezing at a lower temperature, the freeze valves in the drain line of the MSRE coolant system will operate about the same with the fluoroborate salt as they do with the present LiF-BeF2 coolant salt.

Industry will design and build the prototypes of the fuel-salt and coolant-salt pumps for the MSBE. They will modify these designs based on test results and will build the pumps for the Engineering Test Unit and the MSBE. All the pumps will be built to ORNL specifications.

All the pumps will be tested in a molten-salt facility that will be built and operated with government funds. Engineers from the manufacturers of the pumps will be required to participate in this testing, and engineers from other pump and equipment manufacturers will be invited to participate.

The pumps will be operated in the ETU and the MSBE. Engineers from the manufacturers of the pumps will be required to participate in tests of the pumps in these two facilities. Engineers from other pump and equipment manufacturers will be invited.

ORNL will continue the design studies of pumps for molten-salt reactors to assist in our overall reactor design studies and to maintain the competence necessary to monitor the work done by industry and to approve their designs for our use. We will also continue to test critical pump parts such as bearings and seals and to work on the development of molten-salt bearings and bearing materials for use in molten-salt reactor systems.

A request for proposal is being written. This document will accompany the pump specification and will invite pump manufacturers to submit proposals. It will outline the total scope of the work and detail the information to be supplied in it.

Phase I will also include instigation of a program of incipient failure detection for the purpose of reducing the possibility of a sudden pump stoppage and to give the reactor operating personnel an advance warning of impending pump failure or malfunction.

Phase II will then be the actual fabrication of the prototype pump by the manufacturer. It will include designing and fabricating all test facilities, performing any component tests not requiring a large molten-salt system, performing stress-strain tests of any member or configurations not suitable for rigorous analysis, providing any special tools such as those for remote maintenance, testing all auxiliary systems such as the lube oil system, motor-cooling system, etc.

The prototype pump will then be tested in a molten-salt test facility planned for construction at phases of this test. Preliminary design of a molten-salt pump test facility is now underway.

The seller will furnish field representatives to work with ORNL personnel to install, test, and operate the pumps in the molten-salt pump test facility, the ETU, and finally in the MSBE. Additional assistance will be required to disassemble, reassemble, and diagnose and remedy pump problems. Engineers from other pump and equipment manufacturers will also be invited to participate in the tests and operation.

This section discusses the Fuel-Salt Pump, which plays a crucial role in the operation of the system. The pump's primary function is to circulate the molten salt within the reactor core, ensuring efficient heat transfer and maintaining optimal operating conditions. Proper maintenance and monitoring of the Fuel-Salt Pump are essential to prevent disruptions in the system and ensure long-term reliability. Additionally, regular inspection and servicing of the pump are necessary to address any potential issues promptly.

Although the head and flow requirements have changed, as shown in Table 7.3, the basic concept of the fuel-salt pump has not changed significantly from that shown in the last semiannual progress report. Since the reactor vessel design is directly affected by the NPSH required to suppress cavitation, and since the fuel-salt inventory of the system must be held down, a study was made of the effect of pump speed on required NPSH and fuel-salt volume within the pump.

Determine nominal dimensions of the impeller, volute, suction and discharge nozzles, and the minimum required NPSH to suppress cavitation. Pump layouts were made from which the salt volumes within the confines of the pump tank were calculated. The results are shown in Fig. 7.7. The impeller and pump tank diameters are shown to give an idea of the relative pump sizes.

Some design details of the pump have been investigated further. Those surfaces of the pump—tank, its internal structural elements, and the pump shaft that are not in contact with the molten salt—are subject to nuclear heating and will have to be cooled.

A preliminary investigation was made of the amount of shielding needed in the shield plug to protect the lubricant and other radiation-sensitive elements in the region of the bearing housing. Approximately 1 ft of Hastelloy N will limit the accumulated dosage at the lower seal to 108 rads in several years. Additional shielding will be needed to reduce the radiation level at the crane-bay floor elevation for personnel access.

A preliminary study has been made of the relationship between shaft overhang length and shaft diameter for a pump operating at 890 rpm with a shaft critical speed of 1200 rpm. It was assumed that the impeller weighed 1000 lb, and the bearing span was 24.

The Coolant-Salt Pump is a crucial component in nuclear reactor systems. It plays a vital role in circulating the coolant salt throughout the reactor core, ensuring proper heat transfer and temperature control. This pump's efficiency directly impacts the overall performance and safety of the reactor, making it a key focus area for maintenance and monitoring.

The similarity of the fuel-salt and coolant-salt pump requirements has led us to consider using the same pump design for both applications. Differences in head requirements can be taken care of by changing the outside diameter of the impeller. If the head requirements differ greatly, the coolant salt pump can be operated at the next highest speed available in induction motors, provided the shaft critical speed has been designed sufficiently high. It may be necessary to design the coolant-salt pump tank for a higher pressure, but this is compensated for by its lower normal operating temperature of 1150°F.

This facility is needed first to proof-test a prototype of the pump manufacturer's design for the MSBE fuel-salt pump in molten salt at the anticipated reactor operating conditions, excluding nuclear radiation. In addition, a total of six reactor pumps — the fuel- and coolant-salt pumps for both the ETU and the MSBE, and two spare pumps for the MSBE — will be given hot shakedown tests in the facility. Endurance testing of MSBE pumps will also be conducted. This facility will be capable of testing devices for the removal of xenon from the salt by contact with an inert gas and investigating unanticipated problems that may arise during the operation of instrumentation such as pressure, flow, and liquid-level measuring devices when they are available.

The fuel- and coolant-salt pumps will be operated in the facility with one (barren fuel) salt, as was the philosophy for proof-testing the MSRE pumps. This is possible even though the density of the fuel salt is greater than the coolant salt, and the coolant salt head and flow rate requirements may be higher.

Than those for the fuel salt. It may be accomplished by modifying such parameters as speed and pump tank gas pressure, and by using a reduced diameter of the pump impeller, thus overloading the pump drive and overpressuring the facility piping.

Design criteria for the facility have been evolving during the past several months and are believed to be firm at present. The design of the test facility will be influenced by the requirements of the MSBE. Since these are not firmly established, a reasonable amount of flexibility and overdesign have been provided in the criteria for the test facility. The facility is being designed on the basis of a 200-MW (thermal) MSBE system having one fuel and one coolant-salt pump with an AT of 300°F in both salt circuits. The design conditions for the pumps are shown in Table 7.3.

Preliminary design of the test facility has been completed. Basically, the facility will consist of the necessary salt piping system, salt-to-air heat removal system, salt flow restrictors, salt flow measuring venturi, preheaters for the salt-containing parts, and necessary controls and instrumentation. The flow diagram is shown in Fig.9. Provisions will be made to supply electric power to constant-speed or variable-speed motors up to 1500 hp in size. The necessary cover and vent gas system for the pump and salt storage tank will be.

Two fixed flow restrictors and a variable flow restrictor will be used to simulate the pressure drops expected in the MSBE heat exchanger and reactor vessel. This throttling valve will permit the measuring of the head vs. flow.

The heat removal system is sized to remove all energy transmitted to the circulating salt stream by a 1500-hp pump motor. Design studies indicate that two 14-ft-long concentric pipe heat exchangers using 5000 cfm of air at 5 psig supplied to each heat exchanger will dissipate the pumping energy. Positive displacement blowers, to be located outside the building, will supply the cooling air to the 1.

The loop piping, complete with a pump, will contain approximately 200 ft of salt. Piping in most of the loop will be 12 in. ID with a 4-in. wall. A venturi will be provided to measure salt flows of 3000 to 7000 gpm. A 1½-in. pipe-size freeze valve, identical to the MSRE freeze valve, will be used in the pipeline connecting the salt storage tank.

Salt Fuel Pump has been received from Mechanical Technology Incorporated. The scope of the study was to investigate: (1) the rotor dynamics of a long shaft (approximately 32 ft) fuel-salt pump for the two-fluid reactor system; (2) the type and characteristics of a molten-salt-lubricated bearing at the lower end of the pump shaft; and (3) the shaft seal configuration and its characteristics.

The first shaft critical speeds obtained by computer unbalance response programs for both the large- and small-diameter shafts were lower than the design pump speed of 1200 rpm, at 700 rpm and 560 rpm respectively. The study indicated that the second shaft critical speed for the large-diameter shaft is substantially above 1200 rpm and about 25% above that for the small-diameter shaft.

A certain amount of shaft bowing and eccentricity in a uniformly eccentric shaft could be accommodated singly at the shaft's critical speed. The values are limited by bearing eccentricity; a value of 0.95 was used in the computations, which means that the journal and bearing surfaces are very close to rubbing.

The transverse and torsional vibrational characteristics of the inner and outer pump casings were computed, and account was taken for the inertia of the drive motor. The results indicated the need to increase the stiffness of the outer pump casing to avoid a resonance at the pump design speed of 1200 rpm. To raise the first torsional critical speed to at least 30% greater than the design speed requires increasing the thickness of the outer casing to 1 in.

A comparison of hydrodynamic (self-acting) and hydrostatic (externally pumped) film lubrication for the lower shaft, molten-salt-lubricated bearing favored the former. The relatively high viscosity of molten salt provides excellent load capacity and also hydrodynamic film operation in the laminar regime. The inherent simplicity of the self-acting bearing contrasted favorably with the complications.

Of the many types of self-acting bearings considered, the tilting (pivoted) pad bearing design having four pads was selected, as it is by far the most stable bearing available. It should be totally free of instability when properly designed to have adequate preloading, optimum pivot location, and low-inertia pads. It is strongly recommended for flexible shaft applications where the speed may exceed twice the first shaft critical.

A seal configuration using gas-lubricated face seals was studied, and computations were made of the gas film lifting force, thickness, and stiffness, and the gas-leaking flow rates.

Studied. Subcritical operation would reduce, if not eliminate, the probability of low-speed high-amplitude whirl. It would eliminate the large unbalance response amplitudes associated with traversing the first shaft critical speed. The most practical way to achieve subcritical design would be to reduce shaft length, or shaft speed, or both.

If supercritical speed operation is required, the principal other recommendations were: (1) develop a practical means of dynamic shaft balancing and (2) build a rotor-dynamic evaluation simulator. The simulator is not a computer program, but rather a full-scale model of the pump rotor-dynamic system to evaluate its dynamic response experimentally. A reduced-scale model would probably permit a valid evaluation if tilting-pad bearings were used.

The Metals and Ceramics Division continued its investigation of the hard-coated specimens. The composition of each of the coatings was determined by X-ray diffraction. This will conclude the present plans for investigating bearing materials.

The molten-salt steam generator is a vital secondary system component required for the successful operation of molten-salt power breeder reactors. The development of an economical, reliable steam generator will require the combined efforts of ORNL and commercial designers and fabricators of high-pressure and -temperature steam generators. Our plans include developing steam generators for the MSBE with maximum industrial involvement.

ORNL will specify the design criteria and parameters of the sodium fluoroborate coolant salt system and the steam generator system for the MSBE. We will prepare a scope and plan of action for the development of the steam generator and write the specifications.

To provide ORNL and interested industrial participants with the technological background to design the MSBE steam generator, ORNL will design, construct, and operate a full-scale tube test facility to obtain heat transfer, fluid flow, and operational stability data. Components for this facility will be procured from industrial suppliers to provide some experience in fabricating Hastelloy N material components for the MSBE and future MSBRs.

Will be invited to participate in the operation of the facility during tests of full-scale tubes representative of MSBE steam generator designs.

We have produced a rough draft of a conceptual design of a facility for testing full-scale tubes for molten-salt steam generators. This facility has a sodium fluoroborate coolant salt system, space for a full-scale tube test section, and a steam system that can operate at supercritical steam conditions. The design will provide for startup, subcritical, and supercritical operating conditions. The heat rating and design parameters for the test section are given.

We are now preparing cost estimates for the full-scale tube test facility prior to initiating requests for programmatic approval, and work will begin soon on the preparation of MSBE steam generator criteria, operating parameters, and specifications to be submitted to steam generator manufacturers.

We are planning a survey of available fluid-flow computer programs applicable to molten-salt steam generator design.

A program designed to establish the feasibility of remotely cutting, beveling, and welding pipe and vessel closures in a radioactive environment was begun. We evaluated the current status of the automated welding equipment technology for application to remote handling, operation, and monitoring. We decided to investigate the necessary machinery modifications to adapt a system to our requirements.

The system chosen was one developed for the Air Force by North American-Rockwell. The system originated in 1964 from a program to develop procedures and portable equipment for fabricating rocket fluid systems by automatic fusion-welding techniques.

Equipment employs a single compact carriage unit, which is inserted over and attached to the pipe, and then carries an interchangeable cutter or welder module about the pipe. A weld programmer and a standard power source comprise the balance of the equipment. We believe that the use of a single car.

Needed to set up the equipment, especially where weldment repairs may be required. The compactness of this system is also desirable; it is about 4 inches thick radially and about 10 inches long. Considerable progress has been achieved over the past four years in converting the concept to a reliable operational machinery. The Air Force reports satisfactory cutting and welding results in recent prototype equipment trials using a variety of metals, including aluminum, Inconel, and stainless.

We were fortunate in having the AEC obtain design documentation from the Air Force to permit us to proceed to review and adapt the equipment for our remote use in radioactive environments. We prepared 26 detailed shop drawings and a specification package for our prototype mechanical assembly. Requests for purchase were issued, and delivery is expected early in 1969. It is tentatively.

Butt-welding and then performing the welds. We have designed an alternate carriage for welding lip seals. This carriage walks about a set of mating contoured seal lips, carrying the same cutter or welder inserts used with the pipe design. Selection of motor propulsion equipment for this seal joint carriage was kept compatible with that of the pipe cutter-welder carriage drive to permit operation with the same system programmer and instrumentation.

Timely completion of the feasibility portion of the weld development program now underway will permit the use of cutting, bevel, and weld machinery in the construction of future reactor facilities, including the MSBE construction. Application and use of the equipment in plant construction would be enormously beneficial for several reasons: System reliability and quality control studies could be made, and the results compared with conventional inspection methods. Base information of the weld parameters could be recorded for future reference. Substantial construction time and cost savings could result with the use of automated weld machinery.

The analysis of the dynamic response of the MSBR system as it relates to the overall plant control problem was continued. Two approaches to the problem were taken concurrently. These overlap somewhat but are in general complementary. The first was a series of studies aimed at the development of a satisfactory scheme for coupling the power generation rate of the reactor to the requirements of a variable electrical load. In these studies, the models of the major components were necessarily very rough approximations. Although the results are believed to be qualitatively correct, no great significance should be attached to the detailed numerical results. The second set of studies was intended to study, in as detailed a manner as was possible, the dynamic behavior of the steam generator during load transients. Such a study will permit better modeling of this portion of the system for future analyses of the MSBR system as a whole.

Investigation was begun of the dynamics and control of the single-fluid MSBR. This investigation has as its objective the development of a satisfactory method of controlling the reactor power and the system temperatures to satisfy the requirements of a power plant with variable load demand. In the present study, we are using a simulation which will eventually include core kinetics (including temperature-reactivity feedback and some approximation of the effects introduced by circulating the fuel), one primary salt loop, one sec.

In the first phase, the steady-state temperature profile of the system was investigated for various power levels from 30 to 100% of full power. The flow rate of the secondary salt was also included in the calculation. Steady-state jog-mean AT heat transfer and heat balance equations were used with the heat transfer coefficient on the tube side of the exchangers taken to be proportional to the 0. 6 power of the shell-side flow rate. The set of steady-state equations required that several of the variables be specified in order for a solution to be obtained. In all the cases calculated here, the temperatures of the water entering and of the steam leaving the steam generator were held constant; pressures were assumed not to vary with power level.

Maintained constant, it may be difficult to maintain the secondary salt temperature at the outlet of the steam generator above its freezing point of 725°F at the lower power levels (~30%).

We concluded that a control system arranged to maintain the secondary-salt flow rate at its 100% power value, while allowing the primary- and secondary-salt temperatures to vary with power level, should be included in those investigated further in the studies of transient conditions. The investigation of the transient conditions employing the analog computer was begun in the second phase. In this phase, an analog program.

In those which follow, a lumped system model was used, similar to that used in the analysis of the MSRE. The equations describing the system were not linearized, and the latest values for the system parameters were employed. This was accomplished by controlling the temperature of the primary salt entering the primary heat exchanger. The controller was arranged so that a 10°F error in steam temperature would alter the primary-salt temperature at a rate of 1°F/sec. With this arrangement, a 10% step decrease in power demand from 100% to 90% full load yielded a maximum steam temperature variation of about 8°F.

60 seconds for this temperature to return to within 1°F of 1000°F. In a 20% step decrease in steam load from 100% to 80% full load, the maximum steam temperature variation was about 15°F.

In order to decrease the 100 seconds required to return the steam temperature to its design point after a step change in load, an attempt was made to readjust the controller. Efforts here were unsuccessful; however, as the system proved to be unstable. It was therefore concluded that in order to accomplish rapid steam temperature control, the secondary-salt flow rate must be variable during.

The third phase of the study thus incorporated control of the secondary-salt flow rate in the system. Using this control scheme, a 10% step decrease in steam load demand from 100% to 90% full load produced a maximum steam temperature vi of about 5°F. The steam temperature returned to within 1°F of the design point in about 30 seconds compared with 100 seconds above.

The fourth and final phase of this series of analog studies will include the reactor core kinetics and a lumped model of the core heat transfer. Temperature reactivity feedbacks will be included, and an approximation of the transport lags introduced in the delayed-neutron precursor equations due to the circulation of the fuel. The secondary-salt flow rate controller will be used to alter the reactivity in the core via the control rods, given a change in the secondary-salt flow rate. Transient conditions will be initiated by varying the steam load demand in a manner similar to that.

These studies are not intended to establish absolute values for the dynamic response of the system. They are of an exploratory nature for the comparison of control system concepts. No attempt has been made at this stage to ascertain the effects of the rates of change of temperatures or of flow rates calculated here on the components of the proposed MSBR system. Further information concerning the system components will be needed in order to establish detailed control system performance requirements.

The MSBR steam generator operates in the supercritical water region. From inlet to outlet, there is a change in density of about a factor of 7. The heat transfer coefficient of the film shows considerable variation. The temperature changes in no simple way with enthalpy input; further, it is a once-through system. These characteristics not only present unusual opportunities for instabilities, but they make invalid many of the simplifying assumptions used in the analysis of conventional systems. We are unable to assume two distinct incompressible fluids, as is frequently done. Neither can we treat.

Preheating, boiling, and superheating in terms of simply defined heat capacities for water and steam and a latent heat of evaporation. We are forced to a more fundamental consideration of incompressible flow with only a few simplifications. We describe the system with the following set of equations. Equations 1 through 3 are, respectively, the mass, momentum, and energy conservation equations for water. 6 and 7 denote the equations of state of water, and 8 provides a definition. In addition, the effect of the throttle is incorporated.

Complex as this description is, it contains a large number of simplifications; for example, neglect of gravitational potential energy, of bulk kinetic energy, representation of friction by a simple "v" term, and many others. Even so, when an attempt was made to solve this set of equations at the Instrumentation and Controls analog computer facility last year, it was found that the problem exceeded the capability of the system. Consequently, the problem was stripped down to much less ambitious proportions and addressed again this time.

The major restrictive simplifications were: (1) the system was linearized, and (2) a single-tube system was modeled. A subcontract has been let to the University of Illinois to develop a program for their hybrid computer which will be free of these restrictions. A hybrid computer is considered to be essential for a full analysis of the problem. (2) Dynamic studies are limited to a small range about a steady-state condition. Steady-state control problems can therefore be studied along with linear stability. However, one cannot study control problems related to large changes in power level, nonlinear stability, or accidents.

Two classes of studies were undertaken: open-loop diagnostics and closed-loop control. In the first class, the system was operated entirely as an open loop at steady state. A perturbation was introduced into some input quantity to the steam generator (inlet water pressure or temperature, throttle setting, inlet salt temperature, or salt velocity), and the effects on certain output quantities (outlet water pressure and temperature, heat).

In the closed-loop studies, we sought to find a control scheme consistent with the following requirements. Heat output should closely follow a heat demand signal, with no more stringent than a linear demand of 5% in 1 minute. The water outlet temperature should remain within a 1°F band, and the outlet pressure within a band of a few pounds per square.

A heat rate and heat demand comparison signal were generated to control the heat output through the throttle setting. Outlet water pressure was controlled by causing an error signal to directly alter the inlet water pressure. However, when time lags were inserted which reasonably approximated the delays in the core and primary heat exchanger, the system tended toward instability, and the limit to a 1°F band simply could not be met. Since the salt velocity (and therefore the heat transfer coefficient from salt to the steam generator) can respond to an error signal with very little lag, a two-stage controller was devised. The outlet water temperature error signal was used to modify the salt velocity for prompt control. The salt velocity then generated an error which was sent, lagged, to the salt inlet temperature.

360/75 includes six delayed neutron groups and the effect of circulating fuel for both U-233 and U-235. A simplification of the circulating fuel kinetics equations of Meghreblian and Holmes was used. An analog simulation of a two delayed group approximation of McPhee's equations also was in good agreement. The equations used in these calculations do not include temperature effects or heat generation from sources other than those directly proportional to neutron density.

The integral of the relative neutron density, with respect to time after reactivity insertion, was also calculated. The results are given in megawatt-seconds per initial steady-state megawatt (for that fraction of the thermal power which is proportional to neutron density). The calculation shows that for 233U, 0.002 (see Fig. of 235U the levels are increased to 0. 53 and 0. 18 of 70 sec for insertions of -0.002 and -0.010).

The use of resistance thermometers is primarily of interest to the MSRP in reactor, engineering test loop, and research experiment applications that require measurement of small temperature differences at high temperatures. Precise measurement of certain selected temperatures may also be of interest. At intervals, attempts have been made at ORNL to develop or purchase suitable sensing devices for such applications.

Recently, several companies (Electric Thermometers Inc. , Rosemount Engineering Company, Leeds and Northrup) have marketed platinum resistance thermometers that are rated for operation at and above 1200°F and are reasonably priced. Two sets of these thermometers were purchased for test and evaluation. One set consists of a matched pair of thermometers. The other set consists of two off-the-shelf thermometers having the manufacturer's standard calibration.

Three test phases are planned. In the first phase, the thermometers will be tested for gross shifts in calibration under conditions of prolonged operation at high temperatures with occasional wide variations of operating temperature, including return to room temperature. In the second phase, a more accurate determination of high-temperature calibration and calibration drift rate will be made with one set. In the third phase, the other set will be installed in an operating molten-salt test loop to obtain data on long-term performance under field conditions. Phase 3 may be performed concurrently with phase 2. Phase 2 and 3 tests will not be performed unless the results of phase 1 are satisfactory.

Phase 1 tests are in progress and nearing completion. In these tests, two resistance thermometer elements were connected in a differential bridge arrangement and heated in a tube furnace. The thermometers were inserted from opposite ends of the furnace and butted together at a position of minimum temperature gradient so that they would be as nearly as possible at the same temperature. Bridge excitation during the tests was 5 V DC. With this excitation, the ΔT measurement sensitivity was approximately 2.7 mV/°F at 32°F and approximately 0.66 mV/°F at 1200°F. Preliminary checks showed that 5 V excitation would not cause appreciable self-heating error.

Phase 1 tests were performed by heating the elements from room temperature to a preselected temperature; operating at this temperature for varying periods of time; and then cooling to room temperature. The bridge output voltage was observed during the cycle to detect calibration shifts and to determine the degree of mismatch of the calibration of the two thermometers. Before and after each cycle, the ice bath (32°F) resistance of each element was measured to determine the magnitude of any shift which occurred.

Extended operation at high temperatures tends to restore the original calibration and to stabilize the calibration for subsequent operation at lower temperatures.

The design of molten-salt reactors requires detailed information on the transport process (heat, mass, and momentum transfer) and the thermophysical properties of the proposed fuel, coolant, and blanket mixtures. The studies on molten salts described below are a part of the effort funded at ORNL by the Special Technology Branch, Division of Reactor Development and Technology, U.S. Atomic Energy Commission, directed to advancing our understanding of phenomena common to general classes of reactors.

While molten salts may be classed as normal thermal transport media, experience during the ANP program also pointed out strongly the need for heat transfer measurements with the specified reactor salts to detect the presence and delineate the effects of such adverse factors as nonwetting or the formation of low-conductivity surface films. Recent studies in this area are described in the first of the following sections.

The second area considered in this report is that of the thermophysical properties of the molten salts, including both the estimation and measurement of these properties. A major effort was mounted during the ANP program to develop measurement techniques.

Of molten salts. With somewhat narrowed scope, these studies were continued as a part of the Molten-Salt Reactor Program during the period in response to questions raised by MSRE operation and are continuing now in support of the Molten-Salt Breeder Reactor Program.

The apparatus assembled for studying heat transfer with the molten salts is shown schematically in Fig. 1. Salt is induced to flow, first in one direction and then in the other, through a small-diameter electrically heated test section by alternately pressurizing with an inert gas.

Utilize the coolant mixture NaF-NaBF4 (8-92 mol%). Operation with this latter melt requires maintaining a BF4-argon mixture over the salt to prevent a significant change in the mixture composition (and accompanying sharp increase in melting temperature) through the loss of the volatile BF4. In turn, this is dependent on the development of satisfactory means for introducing, circulating, storing, and disposing of this toxic gas. A system for accomplishing this has been designed and partially fabricated. In view of the lower volatility of the components in the fuel mixture, argon treated to remove residual oxygen and water vapor is being used as the pressurizing and cover gas in the first experiments. The effluent gas is vented to the outside of the building.

Current flows through the tube wall. The electrodes also serve as the end plates of disk-and-donut mixing chambers located at each end of the test section. A detail of this region is shown in Fig. 9.2. In preliminary operation, overheating at the connection between the power cables and the Inconel electrodes caused severe oxidation of the copper cables. To eliminate this, a water-cooled section was installed between the cable and the wall at ~1-inch intervals. Temperature distribution along the test section is measured by sheath-type couples inserted in wells in the mixing chambers to measure the inlet and outlet fluid temperatures. The test section is insulated by vermiculite contained in a box enclosing the test unit. These wires, after passing over insulated pulleys, carried heavy loads.

Generation and the absence of effects on the thermocouple readings of the tube-wall current were established in an extensive series of preliminary tests. Following these, initial heat obtained is summarized in Table 9.1. Axial inside-wall temperature profiles are shown in the Reynolds modulus. As noted in each case graphed, the axial wall temperature pattern shows oscillations not found in previous molten-salt studies. Curves fitted to the data, as a part of the search for rational understanding, may not, at this time, be of particular significance.

Run 48, shown in Fig. 3, was performed in the laminar flow regime (Reynolds number = 738). The scatter in the wall temperature data is of the order of ±0.5% in isothermal runs at 1200°F; the temperature variation was less than ±0. 2%. Based on the mean line through the data, the derived heat transfer coefficient is 277 Btu/hr-ft^2-(°F)^-1, and the corresponding Colburn j factor is 0.0054. When compared with a plot of the Seider-Tate equation (the Colburn factor with a viscosity gradient correction), this value corresponds to the curve for a heated length-to-diameter ratio of 100. Since the actual tube length is 133, this constitutes rather good agreement. In contrast, the thermal entrance length suggested by the data is 55 tube diameters, whereas theory predicts 336 for a fluid with a Prandtl number of 9.1 at a Reynolds number of.

Figures 9.4 and 9.5 show axial temperature profiles that differ significantly from the one displayed in 9.3. The initial temperature rise is observed to be followed by a temperature decrease, and this, in turn, by an irregular wall temperature pattern. We currently believe that the first part of these curves depicts a laminar-turbulent transition, despite the fact that the mean bulk Reynolds modulus for run 47 (9.5) was ~20,000. Downstream of this, for run 35 (Fig. 9.4), the wall temperature appears to increase.

Temperatures. The data of run 47 (0. 5) were given the same treatment; the temperature pattern here appears much more erratic than noted in run 35. Further speculation at this time on these data is not warranted. Investigation of the above phenomena is continuing. In particular, we will examine the effect.

I will attempt some analyses as to the wall-temperature patterns predicted for specific postulated flows of a fluid having the properties of the MSBR single-region fuel salt. Some changes in the physical arrangement of the test channel insulation and guard heating may also be affected. The possibility of increasing the test section length.

The voltage drop across the gap is determined from thermocouples located on the axial center line in the metal surfaces defining the sample region. The position of the couples is indicated by closed dots. The sample thickness is varied by moving the piston containing the main heater; the separation of the upper surface from the fixed bottom surface is measured by a precision dial indicator. The system temperature level is maintained by a surrounding zone-controlled furnace. The salt, whose conductivity is to be measured, is generally introduced into the apparatus in powdered form. The system is then evacuated and held under vacuum conditions until the salt is melted. During operation, an appropriate cover gas at atmospheric pressure is added to the system.

The film temperature difference is of the same form as the ΔTs given in Eqs. (2) and (3). If surface films are present but of constant and known thickness, Δx, during the experiment, there is no effect on the derived sample conductivity or on the associated error. A film that grows or decays in an unknown way during the course of the measurement introduces an error in.

This apparatus has been used to obtain preliminary data on three molten fluoride mixtures. The smoothed values are given in Table 9. 2, along with calibration results obtained with 40-7-53 wt%, helium, and argon. This table also shows literature values for the calibration fluids and recommended values at the melting temperature (based on calibration and other anticipated corrections) for the three fluoride melts. We find that, in general, results with the calibration fluids are higher than published literature values; most of the observed difference can be attributed to heat losses, which become increasingly significant with decreasing conductivity.

In evaluating the present results, it must be noted that the apparatus used was designed to minimize the error with fluids having thermal conductivities in the range 0. 05 to 0. The data of Table 9. 2 show that the actual conductivities of the fluoride salts are about an order of magnitude lower than expected and that corrections must be made for heat loss. An analysis taking into account the multiple modes of axial and radial heat transfer, as well as the specimen properties, the absolute temperature level, and the capability of the guard heaters, has given corrections that are consistent with the apparatus calibrations. Final data correction should be.

Sample is axially downward parallel to the apparatus's vertical center line. However, if the adjustments are not sufficiently precise — and this is difficult to accomplish — some radial heat flow will be present. The reduced axial heat flow gives rise to a lower measured ΔT, and since Q/A is based on the measured power to the main heater, to a further reduced value for ΔT (Q/A). The consequence of this is curvature in the data plot from which k is derived, with deviations below the true straight line increasing with increasing Δx, and probably with increasing average temperature level. This is illustrated by the data from the NaBF2 measurements shown in Fig. 9.7. The detailed analysis mentioned above is also being used to provide design guidelines for minimizing this effect in a new apparatus currently being fabricated.

The natural circulation leads to k values that are incorrect on the high side. The cell is designed to weaken this effect; it is heated from above so that a stable temperature profile exists, and the aspect ratio of the sample region (upper plate radius over sample gap) is of the order of 50:1. Edge effects may exist since circulation cells set up in the annular gap around the upper (main) heater probably extend into the peripheral regions of the sample disk. We feel this effect is small, although one investigator claims that even at an aspect ratio 2%, times that of the present device, some natural convection effects were observed at the cell center line. A more serious possibility for liquid motion exists in regard to some skewness of the sample gap with respect to the gravitational vector. This would cause the hot fluid to spill off the upper surface at one edge and cooler fluid to return in counterflow along the bottom surface. Such a flow could be.

Highly complex, since the temperature distribution outside the sample region also plays a role in defining the fluid circuits. It should be noted that, while the parallelism of the two surfaces delimiting the sample region has received much attention, the “horizontalness" has been considered a second-order effect. This will be investigated further. Finally, some investigators state that all other factors being perfect are periodic.

In this context, the paragraph appears to be technical in nature. Therefore, it does not have any spelling or punctuation errors that require correction. The text is well-structured and does not contain any issues that need to be addressed.

A number of additional problems were encountered in the NaBF measurements. During the first of three sets of measurements, loss of BF caused a shift in the melt composition toward the NaF-rich side of the NaF-NaBF phase diagram, with an accompanying sharp increase in the melting temperature and probably a marked change in sample conductivity. This eventually led to the failure of the system heaters and severe damage to the apparatus. In the second set of measurements, thermocouple outputs were observed to be erratic; this condition was found to result from inhomogeneities in the thermocouple lead wires. For the final data set, a BF cover-gas system was installed to prevent melt composition changes. Despite all these problems, the total scatter of all three data sets was less than 4%.

At present, we estimate the uncertainty in our preliminary measurements to be between +15% and -35%. Corrected values should have an uncertainty of less than +15%. These studies are being continued, and with a new apparatus, the accuracy should be further improved. In addition, a planned thorough study of the effect on the thermal conductivity of composition changes in a given salt system should lead to more reliable equations.

The total error in the enthalpy was found to be of the order of 1%. This results from a standard error of +0.6% associated with Eq. (6) and a calorimeter calibration error of 0.5%. The data are summarized graphically in Fig. 8; the line shown is the above least-squares fit to the data.

Conductivities of a number of molten salt mixtures, the results are compared in Table 9.4 along with some experimental values. The agreement between conductivities predicted by Eq. (8) and experimental values is excellent for the chloride and nitrate salts listed in the lower part of Table 9. 4. This is not surprising, since the theory is.

A method for removing fission product gases from the fuel salt in a molten-salt breeder reactor utilizes cocurrently flowing small helium bubbles to strip 105Xe from the circulating fuel. The fundamental theoretical problem involved is the description of a scalar transfer within a turbulent shear-flow field as influenced by the presence in the bulk region far from confining walls of a phase interface (bubble) having either rigid or mobile characteristics. The scope of this just-commissioned study includes the measurement of mass transfer coefficients in a two-phase flow over a significant range of the controlling variables and the correlation of these coefficients with theoretical concepts.

The proposed experiment will use helium bubbles to remove dissolved oxygen (simulating 135 Ye) from room-temperature glycerin-water solutions (simulating fused salt). The choice of the oxygen-water-glycerin system was based on an earlier study showing that dynamic similarity with presently conceived MSBR designs could be easily attained. The oxygenated glycerin-water mixture will be circulated through the closed loop diagrammed in Fig. 9. The oxygen is then progressively stripped by transfer to helium bubbles introduced at the test channel inlet and removed at the test channel exit. The size, number, and spatial distribution of these bubbles will be obtained by photographic techniques. The oxygen concentration will be determined with a Beckman.

Analyzer. The range of the variables to be covered is indicated in 0.10. If the average mass transfer coefficient within the test section is constant, the concentration change between the inlet and outlet (Cout/Cin) would be some constant K (less than 1) that includes factors such as the equilibrium solution coefficient, the mass transfer coefficient, bubble surface area, test section length, and gas and liquid flow rates. Since the factors involved in K are either known or to be measured, the average mass transfer coefficient can be extracted from the slope of typical curves obtained from such experiments, which might appear as shown in 0. 11.

Flow is 1 vol% of the liquid flow; the helium bubbles are 0.01 in. in diameter. The test channel is 2 in. in diameter, and 25 ft long, and the transit time is twice that required to traverse the test section. Mass transfer coefficients were estimated by the expression taken from Calderbank.

And Prandtl moduli in heat transfer. The Reynolds modulus and percent glycerine (Schmidt modulus) are parameters in 0.11. To obtain a desirable concentration change of C/C, ~ 0.5 under the postulated conditions requires — at most — a testing time of 15 min.

The experimental system is in an advanced stage of design, and corollary experiments are underway to evaluate techniques for measuring the size and distribution of small helium bubbles in a flowing stream and to develop means for introducing and removing these bubbles.

A major share of these studies is, as in previous periods in this series, concerned with details of the Molten-Salt Reactor Experiment. Routine analysis of the MSRE fuel and coolant salts, and special analyses of fuel and pumpbowl gas samples for fission products, were continued until operations with 35U fuel were completed in March. Further information regarding the distribution of fission products (especially the more noble species) has been obtained through examination of the graphite and metal surveillance specimens and sections of the off-gas lines removed during the shutdown.

Study of fission product behavior has been continued with fuel specimens removed from MSRE, with synthetic fuel mixtures doped with radiotracer elements, and by investigation of the chemistry of molybdenum and niobium fluoride in molten fluoride mixtures.

And protactinium and their complete separation by selective extraction into molten bismuth containing dissolved thorium has been demonstrated in laboratory-scale equipment. An alternative process based on selective precipitation of protactinium and uranium oxides continues to show promise and to yield useful information concerning pertinent oxide-fluoride equilibria. Reductive extraction of the lanthanide fission products continues to prove more difficult than the protactinium-uranium extraction but may well lead to useful separations.

A broad program in solution thermodynamics, electrochemistry, and spectrochemistry, and transport processes in molten fluorides continues to supply basic data for reactor and chemical process design. Physicochemical investigations of fluoroborate mixtures continue to yield useful data for the evaluation of these materials as secondary coolants.

Research and development in analytical chemistry continue to be directed primarily toward improvement in the analysis of intensely radioactive specimens for oxide and especially for U3 in the fuel, and for impurities and fission products in the helium gas from MSRE.

The results of the evaluation are reported in a recent technical memorandum. In summary, compatibility in the reactor is moderately well assured but requires confirmation of PuF, solubility, and oxide tolerance before tests can be made using the MSRE. Although the chemical separation of plutonium and protactinium that would be desirable in a large breeder reactor has not yet been demonstrated, conceptual design of processes for effecting such separations are available for development.

An extensive program of sampling and analysis has been an integral part of all operations with the MSRE. Of the analytical chemical methods which are commonly employed, coulometric titration of dilute aqueous solutions of the fuel salt has found the most general application because of its excellent reproducibility and high precision, around 0. 5%. Notwithstanding, the precision of individual chemical assays of the uranium concentration in MSRE fuel salt samples has only been about one-tenth that obtainable from on-site computations of the reactivity balance. In addition, E.

Until recently, there appeared to be a growing disparity between the measured chemical values and those obtained from nuclear and heat balance data, as noted in the previous report. The chemical results used were obtained from radiochemical and mass spectrochemical, as well as coulometric analysis of the fuel salt, and from fluorometric and delayed-neutron activation analysis of the flush salt.

One possible explanation of the disparity was that the maximum operating power of the MSRE was about 11% greater than assumed in the reactivity balance; that is, 8. 0 rather than 7. 25 MW (thermal). Indeed, there were reasons to be suspicious of the power level. In particular, there was an anomalously pronounced temperature coefficient in the values of coolant salt heat capacity that were used to compute the heat removal. Experiments were initiated, therefore, to obtain accurate values for the heat capacity of the coolant salt. 571 ± 0. 043 cal g-1 (°C)-1 in the temperature range 500 to 700°C, about 10% higher than the values used in previous estimates.

The nominal concentration of uranium in the fuel circuit, therefore, was recomputed from the reactor operating history using a maximum power generation rate of 8.0 MW (thermal). The results of this computation are in excellent agreement with the chemical analyses and show (see Fig. 1) that the concentration at the termination of run 14 should have been 4532 wt%. The corresponding analytical value from a least-squares extrapolation of the analytical data was 4528 wt% (Fig. 1). This difference between the reactivity and analytical chemistry values corresponds to 0.2 kg of uranium out of 220 kg, which is only 0. 10%. The difference is even less when derived from a statistical treatment of analytical results. From the normalized values for uranium analysis, as shown in Fig.

The initial experiment was designed to detect any gross incompatibility in the salt-graphite system, as well as to provide information which might be useful in the design of future experiments. The experiment involved heating to 1400°C (estimated boiling point of MSRE fuel salt) a specimen of MSRE grade graphite in contact with MSRE fuel salt contained in a tube of ATJ graphite with a static helium overpressure of 1.3 atm. The experimental setup is shown in Fig. 1. The tantalum foil was wrapped around the graphite tube in order to afford some protection for the alumina container in the event of a severe leak through the graphite tube.

For examination. After each heating and cooling cycle, the container was opened in a dry box, and the graphite tube was examined for indications of salt leakage or adverse container reactions before proceeding to the next higher temperature. The pressure was followed with a Bourdon gauge (sensitivity limit ~0.5 psi) throughout each run. No gas generation was observed.

Visual examination of the graphite specimen revealed no indication of attack by the salt, and its dimensions, determined with a micrometer, were essentially unchanged. The portion which had been in the gas phase was coated with beads of salt, which were almost perfectly spherical in shape; thus, there was no wetting by the condensed salt.

Salt crystals, identified as ZrF, were found on the outside of the graphite tube in a region (4A in, 3) that was well below the maximum temperature of the experiment and considerably above room temperature. This material was identified both by x-ray diffraction and by petrographic analysis and was surprisingly free of other glass. Glass was found on the tantalum foil in a nearby region (4B, 3). No uranium compounds were detected in these colorless deposits. Since the open end of the tube was in a water-cooled connector, one is led to conclude that the ZrF, BeF, and LiF vapors must have come through the ATJ graphite tube.

The salt beads from the graphite specimen were composed of compounds of LiF, BeF2, and ZrF4; and although there was a slight greenish color, uranium compounds were not detected by X-ray or petrographic examination. The sample from the lower-temperature region (3A,. 3). The fraction of salt involved in these vapor deposits was small, but the time at 1400°C was only ~15.

The lines attributed to UF were strongest in samples taken near the liquid-vapor interface (QA, 3). Uranium trifluoride could not be positively identified by petrographic examination, but an unidentified dark-colored phase which had the hexagonal morphology typical of UF.

Spectrochemical analysis of the bulk salt (1 and 2A, 3) indicates higher concentrations of aluminum than were present in the starting salt. This, as well as the presence of AlF, mentioned previously, indicates that reaction (2) may have occurred. Reaction (3) is known to occur readily at elevated temperatures. It should be emphasized that the mechanism proposed is applicable to this experimental design, not to MSR conditions, and that most of the uranium remained in the 4 state.

This experiment seems to confirm that there is no gross incompatibility of MSRE fuel and graphite at 1400°C. However, graphite (at least ATJ variety) is permeated by the volatile components of the fuel near its boiling point and therefore is an unsatisfactory container.

The corroded cap was sectioned through the ae in holes and submitted for metallographic showed a small core of solid metal surrounded by empty spaces and flaky or granular deposits. Metallographic examination indicated that all of the metallic regions were mild steel. In places, the original nickel plate was intact. The surface of the metal had a metallographic appearance typical of corrosion and not characteristic of mechanical breaking off or abrasion.

It was known, however, that, because of the reducing nature of the fuel, due to UF6, such an amount of iron ion was not present. Hence, it was sometimes assumed that iron, if present at all, was a colloidal suspension. Now that the corrosion of the cap has been observed, we believe that there is no elemental iron present. This implies that the analytical numbers were not valid at this low concentration range, and, indeed, tests on the reduction of tracer iron have confirmed this implication. Also, if this explanation holds, there must have been no elemental chromium available, as from the addition of beryllium or even as chromium in Hastelloy N. This may be evidence that the Hastelloy N is coated with noble-metal fission products.

Superficially, the condition of an iron cap in contact with a copper capsule appears to be favorable for bimetallic couple corrosion. However, for iron to have dissolved as the anodic reaction, an equivalent reduction of cations more noble than ferrous iron at the cathode was required. The absence of such noble ions, again as a result of the presence of UF6, precludes the bimetallic couple explanation. Of course, the reduction at the copper would have been U going to U, but in this case, the cell reaction becomes the equation discussed in the last paragraph.

A more likely explanation is that an electrode concentration cell was involved. Thus, iron was removed from a high-concentration electrode, the iron cap, and deposited at a low-concentration electrode, the walls of the primary system. This could have occurred even with a very low concentration of Fe in the salt and with electrical contact between the iron and Hastelloy N.

Previous work has sought to establish the ultimate fate of nuclides generated by fission in the MSRE fuel. It was found that species with stable fluorides remained largely in the fuel. The noble metal species possessing less stable fluorides (Mo, Tc, Te, Ru, and Nb) behaved quite differently, with less than 1% remaining in the fuel salt and the remainder depositing on graphite and metal surfaces or being carried off with the helium.

Economy in an MSBR would be significantly affected if too large a fraction of the noble metal fission products deposited on the graphite core. Second, it has recently been realized that decay heat from heavy deposits of fission products might cause dangerous heating of graphite and metal surfaces in an MSBR in the event that normal cooling mechanisms failed. Third, the design of an MSBR off-gas system must provide for the appreciable quantities of non-gaseous fission products carried by the off-gas stream.

The practical solution to these problems necessitates reliable quantitative data on deposition rates and volatilization rates, along with sufficient basic understanding of the phenomena involved so that results from the MSRE operation may be safely extrapolated to an MSBR. In the current report period, progress has been made toward the first objective by a careful examination and analysis of the third long-term surveillance assembly of graphite and Hastelloy N specimens removed from the MSRE core after the completion of the 735U operation on March 25, 1968.

A third set of graphite and Hastelloy N long-term surveillance specimens was removed from the MSRE core after the March 25, 1968 shutdown and delivered to the hot cells on April 5 for disassembly, segmenting, and surface sampling. Previous surveillance assemblies contained only CGB graphite of the core and “lattice stock” varieties.

Fissioning salt only through the third irradiation period (32,000 to 64,000 MWh) and contained CGB core graphite (P-55, Y-9, and P-58), impregnated CGB core graphite (V-24, P-77, P-92, and V-28), pyrolytic graphite (PG), and Poco graphite (K-1). We have been informed by H. Cook that too low a pressure was used to impregnate the CGB samples with pitch before firing so that the surfaces of the impregnated CGB specimens were not as well.

The 12 graphite specimens were rectangular bars, each 0. 67 inches wide but varying in thickness. At least two surfaces of each bar were exposed to flowing fuel salt; the remaining surfaces were stacked against other graphite surfaces in the assembly. Each specimen was examined visually with a 30-power stereomicroscope; then it was weighed, and the length was measured.

Five of the bars (X-13, PG, K-1, P-58, and P-77) were cut across the length to provide samples for milling (3 to 6 in. long), for D. Cuneo's sanding procedure (1 to 3 in. long), for metallography and autoradiography (4 in. ), for X-ray diffraction (4 in. ), for electron microscopy (4 in. ), and for X-radiography (two 10-mil-thick slices). Both ends of each bar were cut off to exclude the region covered by the Hastelloy N straps, which held the graphite pieces in place in the assembly. The surface that had been in contact with graphite was marked with a thin abrasive wheel.

An improved procedure was developed by Stewart Dismuke and Warren Parsley to sample the graphite surfaces in the hot cell. Each piece of graphite was glued to an accurately machined length of angle aluminum in such a way that two salt-exposed surfaces of graphite faced away from the aluminum. A tared plastic sample bottle was mounted below the rotating cutter to catch the graphite powder as it was cut off the mounted specimen. Preliminary tests showed that 95 to 99% of the graphite milled off was collected in the plastic bottle. Before the surface milling was started, the same milling machine was used to corner between surfaces that were to be sampled. This eliminated the problem of contaminating.

Through a hot-cell window, it proved difficult to locate the graphite surface with the cutter within a precision of % mil for the first cut. The best procedure proved to be to approach the surface ½ mil at a time with the rotating cutter and, through a Kollmorgen periscope, watch for graphite powder falling off the cutter. A few first cuts several mils thick were taken before this procedure was settled upon. There were no problems in controlling the depth of cuts beyond the first. This milling procedure for sampling, while more laborious and time-consuming than the previous planing procedure, was considered superior in controlling contamination, in providing thinner first cuts, and in assuring parallel cuts.

Ten cuts on two faces were made on samples X-13, PG, and K-1. One deep cut on the wide face was made on sample P-55. The sampling scheme was designed to yield more complete information on the more interesting.

The milled specimens were weighed and shipped to the analytical laboratory. Since analyses were desired for some short-lived fission products (in particular, ^99Mo and ^15Te), the hot-cell operations were carried out as speedily as possible. It was later decided to mill samples from two more impregnated graphite specimens (P-77 and P-92). It was not possible to determine ^90Mo, ^132Te, and +311 for these last.

Results of Hot-Cell Examination of Graphite. The program of graphite examinations and analyses was similar to that carried out for previous surveillance specimens. The hot-cell examinations were repeated mainly to see whether the previous results were confirmed for several new types of graphite specimens, and whether any new observations turned up. The only new type of hot-cell test was the examination of the graphite surface.

Under examination with a 30-power stereomicroscope, the graphite specimens appeared similar to those from previous surveillance assemblies. There was no sign of corrosion or chemical attack. Occasional droplets or flakes of flush salt adhered to the surface, more frequently on the faces in contact with other specimens. Flat flakes of dark-green fuel salt were sometimes found on these back faces. Quite a few scratches and gouges were visible on the graphite surface, but these appeared to have been freshly made, probably during the mechanical operations of disassembly of the package. Most of the specimens lost between 1 and 9 mils in length out of a total length of 9 in. Adhering salt probably accounted for the 5- to 6-mil gain for two were not wiped or scraped before weighing and measuring since it was important not to remove any adhering films before analysis. Except in the case of Poco graphite, a slight loss in length was expected because of the neutron fluences experienced by the graphite samples. Contractions were larger for the more centrally located specimens where the neutron flux was higher.

The graphite surfaces were examined carefully under the 30-power stereomicroscope with various kinds of lighting to detect any surface films. A brown dusty-looking film was discerned, covering about half of the fuel-exposed surfaces. No shiny films were observed.

Surface films were also sought with the hot-cell electron microscope. Cellulose acetate tape was dampened with acetone and pressed against a fuel-exposed surface of a 1-inch-long sample from each graphite bar. After it was dry, the tape was torn loose. A visible thin film of surface graphite adhered to the tape. The examination of these screens by the electron microscope showed only graphite diffraction patterns, although later.

Surveillance specimens. Many of the salt-exposed surfaces and some of the other surfaces appeared to have a thin film of heavy material, less than 10 mils thick. The only specimen showing cracks was the pyrolytic graphite. The cracks were parallel to the graphite planes. Some of the empty cracks may have occurred during the cutting of the thin samples of this fragile, brittle material. However, a halo of heavy material, presumably fuel salt, was observed in the vicinity of some of the cracks, while the cracks themselves were empty. This may have been a filled crack that opened wider on cutting. The white band across the end of the specimen was identified as a ledge of graphite that remained on the specimen when it cracked off the bar, when the cutting wheel had nearly cut through.

Radiochemical Analyses of the Graphite Surface Samples. The program of graphite analyses was similar to those for previous surveillance specimens. Twelve specimens were analyzed rather than the usual three since four types of graphite were represented in the third surveillance test. The objectives of the rather thorough analytical program were (1) to confirm previous results for CGB graphite; (2) to compare concentration profiles and total deposition of 12 nuclides on CGB, impregnated CGB, Poco, and pyrolytic graphite; and (3) to provide more accurate deposition data needed for solving practical reactor problems.

During the dissolutions, traps were provided to catch volatilizing activities such as Ru and I. The traps were analyzed separately. Radiochemical separations were made before each species was counted, except in the case of rare earths, where the whole group was isolated and the individual components determined by a computer analysis of the gamma spectrometer scan.

From these analyses and the depth of milling for each sample, concentration profiles to a depth of 50 mils were drawn for each nuclide and each surface sampled. The depth of cut was determined by dividing the volume of the sample (measured weight divided by density) by the sampled area (measured length times measured width). For the thinner samples, this procedure was more accurate than direct reading on the milling machine. Since there were more than 1200 data points and more than 120 profile curves, it is not practical to report them in detail here. A few concentration profiles will be shown to illustrate particular points in the ensuing discussion of the general features of most interest.

Four concentration profiles were determined on three specimens of CGB graphite, all located near the middle of the MSRE core. Profiles were obtained on the wide face of specimens Y-9 and P-58 (single exposure) and on both a wide and a narrow (Mwhr) face. The profiles were in general similar in shape to those observed for the two previous sets of surveillance specimens. Because the first few cuts were thinner than could be taken with the previous sampling method, the initial slopes of the profiles were seen to be steeper than previously indicated. The concentrations of the noble metals 99Mo, 103Ru, 106Ru, 95Nb, and 111Ag usually dropped by about four orders of magnitude in penetrating 5 to 10 mils into the graphite. The four sets of profiles were by no means identical; however, Figure 2 shows the variations for 103Ru between the wide and narrow faces of the X-13 sample. For these nuclides and several others, the initial concentration gradient for penetration from the wide face was less steep than for the narrow face. As previously, variations of this kind were interpreted to indicate the variable porosity of CGB graphite even between different faces of the same specimen.

As previously observed, the 13Te and Te profiles showed a more gradual initial drop than the other noble metals. Among the latter, Mo dropped less precipitously than the Ru or Nb concentrations. Thus, the noble metals appear to be diffusing independently of one another, rather than as combined particles or, for example, deposits on microscopic graphite particles. The X-13 profiles leveled out at deep penetrations, but the P-58 profile kept decreasing.

The 95Zr profile was similar in shape to those of the noble metals, but its activity was lower by about two orders of magnitude than that of its daughter, 95Nb (Zr). It is clear that 95Nb, evidently as metal, penetrated preferentially from the fuel salt into the graphite. The MSRE pump bowl gas analyses (and other tests) have shown that 95Nb (like other noble metal fission products) has a tendency to concentrate in the gas phase above molten salt, much more so than 95Zr.

Other species with stable fluorides suggest that the same escaping tendency caused 95Nb to leave the fuel and enter the pores of graphite more readily than 95Zr. Once in the pores, the 95Nb (and other noble metals) apparently deposited readily.

It had previously been reported that the plots of the logarithm of concentration vs. penetration depth for these elements were straight lines. This remained true for Sr beyond about 2 mils and for Ba beyond about 5 mils, but the initial gradient was much steeper in all cases. The initial gradient may have been due to Sr and Ba entering as the element rather than as the precursor gas. The linear portions showed a considerable variation.

For the first time, complete profiles were obtained for 141Ce and 144Ce in CGB graphite. These are shown for X-13 wide face and P-58 in 5. For 141Ce, there is a steep initial drop for a few mils, then a flattening to a linear slope. The linear slopes are only slightly steeper than for 140Ba, whereas the half-lives of the Xe precursors are 1. 7 sec and 16 sec for 141Ce and 140Ba, respectively. This suggests that 144Ce has a mode of diffusion other than as 141Xe.

The Ce-141 curves for X-13 and P-58 are unaccountably different. Both show a steep initial drop, but the curve for X-13 wide face levels out at 6 x 10^8 dis min^-1 g^-1, while that for P-58 continues dropping to 1 x 10^6 dis min^-1 g^-1. The profile for Y-9 behaved like P-58, and that for X-13 narrow face like X-13 wide face. Cerium-144 has a very short-lived Xe precursor.

CGB graphite specimens P-77 and P-92 showed ^144Ce profiles more like those for X-13. The profile for pyrolytic graphite for penetration perpendicular to the planes leveled out as for X-13, while that for penetration parallel to the planes continued dropping as for P-58. The Poco graphite profiles had a shape intermediate between the two types. The initial slopes for ^95Zr were much steeper than for ^144Ce for all.

Salt. The total of this information leads to no clear explanation of 144Ce behavior. It can perhaps be tentatively concluded that CGB-structures vary in such a way that the low-capacity, high-speed mechanism leading to flat tails is sometimes but not always blocked for 144Ce.

The concentration profile for 1941 in specimen P-58 was similar to those previously reported, with a steep initial drop by a factor of 20 in the first mil; then a progressively less steep gradient, as for many Te profiles. The profile for X-13 wide face was less steeply sloped in all parts of the curve. That for X-13 narrow face was quite different; in fact, nearly duplicating the curve for 95Zr on the same face. It dropped sharply through nearly four orders of magnitude in 7 mils, then suddenly leveled out. This again shows clearly a difference in graphite structure for the two faces.

Only selected CGB samples were analyzed. Samples were taken from X-13 wide face and P-58. The **137Cs** dropped by a factor of 15 in the first 5 mills, then leveled off. Both Ag nuclides dropped by more than three orders of magnitude in 5 mills. The **91Y** concentration decreased by a factor of 5 in 5 mills, then became level. The **47Nd** dropped steeply by more than a factor of 100 in 5 mills.

Many of the Y-9 profiles were unusual in that they exhibited a rise by as much as a factor of 5 after the usual initial drop in concentrations. Beyond the broad hump, concentrations again decreased. The rise was at 10 mils penetration for 9°Mo, 95Nb, and 1341, but at 5 mils penetration for these humped profiles are shown in Fig. 6. There was no discernible hump in the profiles for which an explanation has been found for the unusual humps. It is very improbable that analytical error accounts for the humps, since most of the profiles were rather smooth, monotonically decreasing curves with less than one point in ten significantly out.

Impregnated CGB Concentration Profiles — Even though the impregnation of CGB graphite specimens P-77 and P-92 was not completely successful, an effect on fission product penetration was measurable. Most profiles were quite similar in shape to the CGB profiles, resembling the P-58 profiles more than the X-13 profiles, in that the curves tended to continue dropping at 50 mils penetration, rather than leveling off like most of the X-13 profiles. For most isotopes, the impregnated CGB profiles were steeper and reached lower final concentration than the CGB profiles.

But the differences were not large. However, pronounced differences were observed for 89Sr and 140Ba. The slopes for 89Sr were a factor of 10 per 50 mils for P-77 and P-92, while those for the CGB specimens were factors of 1 to 2 per 50 mils.

Pyrolytic Graphite Concentration Profiles — These profiles are of interest since pyrolytic graphite represents the ultimate in decreasing the porosity of graphite. The density of the specimen used (P-103) was 2.225 g/cc. In accordance with expectations, the penetration of all fission products in the direction perpendicular to the graphite planes was greatly reduced. All of the profiles except those of Sr. and Ba were essentially identical, showing an initial steep drop of three to five orders of magnitude in 7 mils, then leveling out. The drop was even steeper than indicated here since the first cut was excessively heavy, with a thickness of 4.5 mils (due to difficulty in locating the surface with the milling cutter).

The Sr and Ba profiles, as depicted in Fig. 8, exhibited significant differences compared to the corresponding CGB profiles. The Sr profile in CGB plateaued around 10^11 dis min^-1 g^-1 at 8°C, whereas the pyrolytic graphite profile continued to decrease to 7. An intriguing observation from Fig. 8 is that the Sr and ^140Ba profiles almost overlapped each other. Among all the specimens analyzed, ^140Ba exhibited a notably steeper concentration gradient than Sr. This notion is bolstered by the considerably higher concentrations of noble metals in disintegrations per minute per gram compared to those of ^89Sr and ^140Ba at deeper penetration depths (20 to 50 mils). Conversely, this trend was inverse for all other graphites studied.

For the pyrolytic graphite specimen, concentration profiles were also determined in the direction parallel to the graphite planes (narrow face). For all nuclides except Sr-90 and Ba-140, the profiles were qualitatively similar to those for CGB specimens, usually somewhat steeper and often reaching.

Face profiles showed similar initial slopes and slightly higher final (40 to 50 mils) concentrations than the perpendicular (wide face) profiles. The face profiles were much more like CGB profiles than like the wide face ones, less steep.

The curves for Sr and Ba shown in Fig. 8 clearly show the difference in diffusion behavior in the parallel and perpendicular directions.

Also, the usual difference in slopes for Sr and 140Ba is observed. It seems clear that in the parallel direction, we are dealing again with the diffusion of rare-gas precursors. A final conclusion may be drawn from the above observations that the in graphite depended much more on the presence of porosity than did the diffusion of the noble metals and Zr. Since the analytical data for 144Ce were often questionable and showed much scatter, its placement in the above grouping is in some.

Poco Graphite Concentration Profiles. This variety of graphite was included because of its resistance to radiation damage and because its structure varied from the CGB structure in the opposite way from pyrolytic graphite. Poco graphite has relatively large pores of a uniform diameter and is isotropic in all its physical properties. Concentration profiles were determined from two faces of the same specimen.

The species Mo-99, Ru-106, Ru-102, Nb-95, and Zr-95 had profiles qualitatively similar to those for CGB, with steep initial drops of several orders of magnitude in a few mils, and then a sharp transition to a less steep slope. The profiles from the two faces did not duplicate themselves any more precisely than for CGB graphite. The profiles from the narrow face were usually slightly steeper at deep penetrations, started at higher initial concentrations, and dropped to lower final concentrations.

In CGB graphite, this concentration was observed in the linear range of the profiles at depths of 20 to 30 mils. The relatively large pores of Poco graphite are undoubtedly responsible for the unique flatness of these Ba profiles, but it is not clear why the profiles for CGB should start at a higher level before crossing those for Poco graphite.

The **141Ce** profiles for Poco were markedly different from those for CGB graphite. The initial drops were much steeper, and the linear tails were much less steep than for CGB graphite. The final concentration was higher for Poco graphite. The linear tails are probably characteristic of Xe precursor diffusion and should be flatter for the larger pores of Poco graphite. The diffusion mechanism responsible for the initial slope must be faster in CGB graphite.

The behavior in Poco graphite was within the considerable range of behavior observed for the several CGB profiles. The profiles were not nearly identical for the two sides of this supposedly isotropic graphite. The initial slope was much steeper for the narrow face profile. The final slopes were downward like Y-9 but very much unlike X-13 narrow face.

Overall Deposition on Graphite Surfaces. For most of the practical uses of the data on penetration of fission products into graphite, the shape of the concentration profiles is of less significance than the total amounts deposited on or in the graphite. Since, in most cases, the bulk of the nuclide is deposited within a few mils of the graphite surface, the total depositions are reported in terms of disintegrations per minute per square centimeter of graphite surface. The activities were calculated back to the time of shutdown of the MSRE before the removal of the surveillance specimen package (1 AM, March 25, 1968).

The number of disintegrations per minute in each milled sample of graphite was obtained by multiplying the analytically reported disintegrations per minute per gram by the sample weight.

Per minute per square centimeter. In many cases, the first few cuts contained 99% of the nuclide, and the contributions of deeper cuts could be neglected. In the case of Sr and other species with flat concentration profiles, the calculated totals were low, since they did not include the significant quantities at depths below 50 mils (the maximum depth of sampling of each graphite surface). The only cases where the error is significant are for Sr in most specimens and for 140Ba in Poco graphite. The surface concentration results obtained in this way are shown in Table 11. 1, which also lists the sample distance from the bottom of the core, the type of graphite, and the exposure in megawatt-hours. 

A number of regularities added credibility to the results. The average agreement between wide and narrow faces for the same specimen was well within a factor of 2. For the three isotopic pairs (19Te and 19Te, 109Ru and 106Ru, 141Ce and 144Ce), the deposition results were nicely parallel when plotted as a function of.

By a factor of about 3 from the bottom of the core to the middle, then decreased by a somewhat larger factor to low values for the specimens at the top of the core. This humped pattern was not observed for the other six fission products. The most obvious parameter which varies with the core.

Positioned in a similar humped pattern is the neutron flux. It is conceivable that flux-dependent processes like fission recoil might drive some fission products into the graphite, but it is not clear why only half the nuclides should be affected by it.

The deposition on the doubly exposed CGB specimens (8000 to 64,000 Mwhr) was not significantly different from that for the CGB specimens exposed only during the last 32,000 Mwhr. However, the deposition of most nuclides on the doubly exposed specimen at the top of the core (MR-10) was usually slightly lower than on any other specimen. It might indeed have been expected that the 1.06-year-half-life Ru would have accumulated to a greater extent for the longer exposures. The deposition of long-lived 144Ce (285-day half-life) also showed no increase with longer exposure. For nuclides with half-lives short compared with the exposure times, the material deposited during the first exposure would have decayed away before the end of the second exposure. The lack of increased deposition for long-lived species for longer exposures possibly implies that early deposits slough off as new material deposits. Another optimistic interpretation of the behavior is that deposition rates gradually decreased with time.

It was disappointing that the total deposition of all nuclides on impregnated CGB graphite was not significantly lower than on untreated CGB graphite, even though the impregnated CGB concentration profiles often showed steeper initial slopes. However, the uniform behavior of all types of CGB graphite provided a convenient reference curve for comparison with the deposition on Poco and pyrolytic graphite.

It was expected that deposition on pyrolytic graphite, particularly in the direction perpendicular to the graphite planes, would be low compared with deposition on CGB. The plots show that this 5Zr, and 44Ce. The species with low deposition are those which appeared to diffuse as if they or their precursors were gaseous. The others usually had very steep initial concentration profiles and behaved as if gaseous transport or porosity were not involved in their mobility.

The deposition results on Poco graphite were rather puzzling. The deposition of 133Te, 130Te, and 131I was higher than the CGB norm, but the other nuclides showed deposition in line with that on CGB. Since the concentration profile of 140Ba in Poco graphite was flatter than for CGB, 140Ba would be in the group with Te and I if the deposition calculation included the material at depths greater than 50 mils. The same cannot be definitively stated for 89Sr, since the profiles in CGB were also flat. The low deposition of 90Sr and 141Ce on Poco graphite is not explained.

On average, then, the type of graphite appeared to have a relatively small effect on surface deposition. It appears hardly worthwhile to attempt to develop a more impervious graphite from the standpoint of decreasing surface deposition. On the other hand, the more permeable Poco.

Type of graphite appeared to be nearly as satisfactory as CGB as far as surface deposition was concerned, except for the 5Xe problem. It might therefore be possible to relax the permeability specifications in developing molten-salt reactor graphites for other desirable physical and.

The last row in Table 11. 1 provides the average deposition for all nuclides on all types of CGB specimens (untreated, impregnated, and doubly exposed). With four specimens near the top, nine near the middle, and four near the bottom, the averages are not heavily influenced by the values in a specific axial region of the core. In cases where certain species display a flux dependency, it is anticipated that the averages across the entire core would be significantly lower.

Diffusion and Deposition of Uranium in Graphite. The presence of uranium in graphite to any appreciable extent would indicate an instability of the fuel salt and possibly cause chemical damage to the graphite. Also, if a substantial concentration of 235U were present in graphite during irradiation, fission products might be born inside the graphite.

The two Poco profiles agreed very well with each other and were about 20% lower than the Y-9 curve, except for the first-cut sample on the wide face. This had the highest individual 35U concentration of any of the samples, 250 ppm, which may have been due to a particle of fuel salt on the specimen surface. The two X-13 (doubly exposed graphite) curves agreed poorly with each other. The wide face profile started at 100 ppm and decreased only to 6. 5 ppm at 50 mils. This was the only instance where the final concentration significantly exceeded 1 ppm.

The file of X-13 started at 166 ppm and dropped steeply to 1 ppm at 15 mils. The P-58 profile was lower than the Y-9 profile by about 40% over its whole course. The profiles in impregnated graphite specimens P-77 and P-92 were similar to each other and matched the Y-9 curve over most.

In most cases, the total range of variation of the 235 concentration in 50 mils penetration was less than two orders of magnitude. This moderate slope indicates a higher mobility for uranium in graphite than for most fission products. The profiles were all rather similar except that for diffusion in pyrolytic graphite perpendicular to the planes. All but one of the profiles showed a leveling off at 1 ppm at deep penetrations. If this concentration persisted throughout the thickness of the graphite moderator, it would represent only.

The presence of uranium deep in the graphite led, naturally, to the speculation that some of the fission products found in the graphite might have been born there by fission of some of this uranium rather than by diffusing in from the fuel salt. Even before a quantitative comparison was made, it was obvious that the slopes of the concentration profiles for the fission products and for uranium were quite different. However, it was of interest to see whether internal fission might account for the flat tail regions of the profiles, and the data existed in convenient form for a quantitative comparison, so it was carried out. The calculation takes into account the power history of the MSRE, dilution by flush salt and the heel in the drain tank, etc. The computed fission product concentration per gram of salt (in disintegrations per minute per gram) at the time of the March 25, 1968, shutdown was converted to disintegrations per minute per gram of uranium by multiplying by the known number of grams of salt per gram of uranium.

Corrected for flux by multiplying by the known ratio of the flux at each specimen position to the average flux used in the computation. The corrected disintegrations per minute per gram of uranium value, when multiplied by the number of grams of uranium per gram of graphite for each analyzed sample, could be compared with the observed value for that sample. This method of calculation assumes that the uranium was in the graphite for the total power history; thus, the calculated values should be high by at least a.

Rather than show the results of this comparison in detail (over 1800 numbers), the results are summarized in a chart showing which milled cuts gave calculated values equal to or greater than the observed values (Table 11. 2). The first point which stood out was that the calculated values were much smaller than the observed values for the large majority of cases. For the first cut, the ratio of observed to calculated was usually greater than 103 and fell off to lower values for the deeper cuts. The observed Sr and Ba values were also higher than the calculated ones, except for pyrolytic graphite.

Direction perpendicular to the graphite planes. For the remaining isotopes, the calculated concentrations often equaled or exceeded the observed concentrations in the deeper cuts, but the ratio of calculated to observed concentrations usually was near 1 and seldom exceeded 3. Pyrolytic graphite was exceptional in this regard, with some of the deep-cut ratios exceeding 10 for 95Zr, 90Sr, 140Ba, and 141Ce. This may indicate that it took a longer time for uranium to diffuse deep into pyrolytic graphite than into the other graphites. Table 11. 2 shows that the calculated concentrations of most isotopes exceeded the observed values more frequently for pyrolytic graphite (perpendicular) than for any other specimen. This, of course, is consistent with the concentration profiles. They showed unusually steep initial drops for all fission products, but the uranium profiles were not as different from those for other specimens. These all happen to be species which showed little indication of independent mobility (or gaseous behavior) in the concentration profiles.

For these species, then, it is possible that the flat tails at the deep ends of their concentration profiles may be accounted for by fission of uranium already in the graphite. Iodine-131 may also belong in this group. However, the profiles near the surface require a different diffusion mechanism. For the other species, different mechanisms are required to account for the whole course of the profiles.

The uranium concentration profiles show that a considerable fraction of the total uranium in the graphite is concentrated near the surface. It is, therefore, meaningful to calculate surface concentrations of uranium, as was done for the fission products. These values are shown in Table 11.1, last column, and are plotted as a function of core position in. 15. The points for all types of CGB graphite are in a narrow band covering a factor of 2 in concentration except for a single point that corresponds to the unusual profile for X-13 wide face previously discussed.

One of the points for Poco graphite is outside the CGB band; this is due to the previously discussed single high value for the first cut of Poco's wide face. The total deposition on pyrolytic graphite for diffusion perpendicular to the graphite planes (PYL) is about 4 times the CGB norm.

The deposition and diffusion of uranium in graphite appear to depend little on graphite structure and porosity. Even in the most impermeable direction in pyrolytic graphite, the uranium concentrations are about 5% of those in more pervious graphites.

The last row in Table 11.1 indicates that the average uranium deposition on CGB graphite amounts to 0.800 pg/cm. Multiplying this by the total graphite surface area in the MSRE, 2 x 10^6 cm, the total surface deposition of ^235U on the graphite in the MSRE is 1.6 g.

Spectrographic Analyses of Graphite Samples. Spectrographic analyses of the dissolutions of the graphite samples were requested on each of the deep-cut (50 mils) samples and on the first two cuts on the other specimens. Analyses were made for Be, Zr, and Li, in the hope of determining the extent of surface contamination by bulk fuel (or flush) salt. Analyses were also made for Mo, Fe, Cr, and Ni after concentration of the original very dilute graphite solution.

The Mo results are of most interest since they furnish a check on the conclusions regarding Mo deposition drawn from the observations on ^90Mo. No other fission product was detected spectrographically. It may be noted that Mo deposition was detected only on the specimens near the middle of the core. The samples in Table 11.3 are listed in order of distance from the bottom of the core. The average of the Mo values listed is 10 pg/cm. It may be easily calculated that 136 g of stable Mo nuclides were formed during 32,000 MWhr of MSRE operation. If the percentage of this Mo depositing on the 2 x 10^6 cm of core graphite is the same as for ^90Mo, 9. 0% (see Table 11. 4), then there should be 6 g/cm of stable Mo on the graphite.

Value is gratifying, particularly when it is recalled that the deposition of 99Mo was higher near the middle of the core than near the extremes.

The results showed that only a few micrograms of fuel salt or flush salt per square centimeter adhered to the sampled graphite surfaces. It is interesting that the deposition of Cr and Ni was detected only near the middle of the core, as for.

Analysis of Hastelloy N Surveillance Specimens. The deposition of fission products on Hastelloy N is of concern primarily due to the decay heating problem on metal surfaces of an MSBR in the event of a coolant system failure. Previous results indicated a significant amount of scatter, prompting the need for more precise data to assess the gravity of the decay heating issue.

The Hastelloy N specimens on which fission product deposition was measured in the first two surveillance packages were sections of the perforated tube in which the graphite specimens were contained. Since the tube was to be reused this time, we used instead sections of the 4-inch-diameter Hastelloy N tube used to contain the dosimeter wires.

Top of the package (62 inches) probably did not contain holes in which droplets of salt. A better metal specimen on which to observe deposition since the surface was relatively smooth. Also, the salt flow pattern past the smooth surface was probably more typical.

Specimens After 32,000 MW, the ½-inch tube was segmented so as to obtain seven equally spaced 3-inch-long sections from the Micrograms per Square Centimeter bottom to the top of the core. This spacing had Graphite of Specimen to be slightly altered to avoid the portions of the Sample Be Mo Cr Ni ½-inch tubing that had been covered by the straps which held the surveillance specimens together. The results are shown in Table 11.5 and in Poco-N 0.62, 10.5 square centimeter are plotted as a function of the Pyr I distance of the specimen from the bottom of the Pyr II core. It is seen that two distinct patterns prevail. MR-10N and 131I curves were remarkably flat, with the Mo and Nb curves dropping off toward the top. Table 11. 4. Fission Product Distribution in the MSRE on March 25, 1968 Percent in Percent in Percent in Percent Nuclide Percent in Fuel Cover Gas Graphite Hastelloy ne Total These values represent the percentages of the daily production rate lost to the cover gas per day. Calculated on the assumption that deposition on the surveillance specimens was representative of that on all of the graphite and metal surfaces in the MSRE.

Of the core, the other nuclides showed definite maxima near the middle of the core, with the lowest values near the top of the core. It is possible that humped profiles were produced in every case by fission recoil but were overshadowed by heavy deposition from the salt in the cases where level profiles were obtained. In previous surveillance tests, the results showed much more scatter, and trends as a function of core location were difficult to discern. Previous results also showed distinctly more deposition of all species by an average factor of about 3. Certainly, this discrepancy is at least partly due to the different type of Hastelloy N specimen analyzed in the current test. It was mentioned above that the 1-in. -diam tubing was probably a sample more representative of the metal surfaces in the MSRE. The larger number of samples and the much better quality of the analytical results also argue in favor of the current test as a better measure than previous tests of fission product deposition on MSRE metal surfaces.

For the nuclides whose profiles were level over the length of the core, there is no problem in choosing an average value for deposition. For those with maxima in the middle of the core, it is likely that the lower values at the inlet or outlet of the core were more typical of deposition on the reactor metal surface outside the core. However, the nuclides which showed maxima were also those with low deposition on Hastelloy N, so the averages shown in the last row of Table 11.5 were conservatively calculated using data from all seven specimens.

Fission Product Distribution in the MSRE. Using the new averages for deposition on CGB graphite and on Hastelloy N, together with the previously reported data for the amounts of each nuclide in the fuel salt and in the cover gas in March 1968, a new material balance was calculated, as shown in Table 11. 4. The total inventory of each fission product in the MSRE on March 25, 1968, was taken from a computer calculation using a recently developed program. The revised estimate of 8.0 MW as full power for the MSRE was used in the computation.

The material balance in Table 11.4 differs from the previous one mainly in that the fractions of noble metal fission products deposited on Hastelloy N are considerably lower. This is desirable from the standpoint of the fission product heating problem but undesirable from the standpoint of removing noble metal neutron poisons from the reactor core. The principal changes in the graphite data are for 89Sr and 40Ba. This is because their concentration profiles were more level in the current test and samples as deep as 50 mils were included in the deposition calculations.

The pattern of behavior of the noble metals was not uniform. The deposition of 105Nb on graphite was distinctly heavier than on Hastelloy N, and only 11% was lost to the cover gas.

The total material balance (last column) was much nearer 100% for each nuclide than in previous balances. The fair approximation to a 100% balance in most cases is not to be taken as a true measure of the reliability of the percentages listed. At least three-fourths of the percentages listed are uncertain by a factor of about 2.

Conclusions: The results reported in this section indicate that some progress has been made toward the objective of reliable quantitative information on fission product deposition on graphite and on Hastelloy N. Although the concentration profiles of fission products in graphite showed considerable variations in shape for different specimens of CGB graphite and even for different faces of the same specimen, the total deposition showed much less scatter, usually less than a factor of 2 at a given core location. It is believed that the agreement obtained was not limited by the experimental techniques used but rather by the variability in the graphite itself. Even Poco graphite occasionally showed differences in diffusion and deposition behavior between.

The quantitative data for deposition of fission products on Hastelloy N are less reliable. Deposition on smooth Hastelloy N tubing was lower than in previously reported values for perforated Hastelloy N sheets by factors from 2 to 10, averaging about 3. It is believed that differences in surface roughness and perhaps in fuel salt turbulence near the metal surfaces may account for the discrepancies. The deposition data on the smooth tubing when plotted against sample location gave either level or humped profiles with small variations between adjacent sample points. The regularity and smoothness of the profiles suggest that the precision of the data is well within a factor of 2. It is not possible with data from only one test to estimate the absolute reliability of the deposition data. However, for deposition on smooth surfaces of similar roughness to that of ½-in. Hastelloy N tubing, the data reported for the latter type of specimen are to be preferred over previous data.

Acknowledgments: The authors wish to acknowledge the large contributions to the work on the surveillance specimens by several groups. The Hastelloy N specimen was carried out by graphite specimens; the surface milling and the hot-cell examinations were carried out by E. Kings personnel in Building 3525. We are indebted to a group for some of the graphite and metal specimen dissolutions, and to J. Emery for analyses by delayed neutron counting. Particular thanks are due to E. I. Wyatt's group for the high quality of their radiochemical analyses of a very large number of samples.

On March 25, 1968, shutdown samples were collected to analyze the fission product distribution from a pyrolytic graphite specimen and one core each from specimens labeled as P-55 (unimpregnated CGB) and V-28 (impregnated CGB). These specimens had undergone exposure to MSRE fuel salt during 8. 0 MW of operation. Precision grinding was used to extract small increments from these cores for analysis, and the fission product distributions were evaluated through gamma spectrometry utilizing a germanium crystal to measure individual activities in the graphite powder. Our observations generally aligned with the previously documented fission product distribution in samples retrieved during the May 1967 shutdown. Through this analysis, we may have uncovered a potential explanation for the earlier reported anomaly concerning the observed increase in fission product concentrations.

A specimen surface to a depth of several mils. Comparison of results for the impregnated and unimpregnated CGB material shows that impregnation of the type used for specimen V-28 is not of value in inhibiting penetration of fission products into CGB graphite. As we recognized early in these investigations, effects of cracks or voids in a specimen can cause great uncertainty in interpretation of results.

The cores obtained by boring through the graphite surveillance specimens perpendicular to the surface exposed to MSRE fuel salt were difficult to obtain from the pyrolytic specimen. This material is fabricated in layers and tends to peel apart quite easily when worked after irradiation at high temperature. We found that the first core of pyrolytic graphite was missing within some 25 mils of the end, which was on the back or stagnant-salt side of the specimen. The core was intact, that is, full length, before transferring from the hot cells to a vented glove box for grinding. Because of the undetected loss of ~25 of one end of the core, our last sample. The approximately three weeks of cooling needed for the other samples from this core. It was found to exist from 135 mils from the hot salt surface to the back side of the.

A second core from the pyrolytic specimen was drilled and sampled. The results of analyses are shown in Fig. 18. In all cases in this discussion, the numerical values given for nuclides are calculated back to the time of MSRE shutdown, March 25, 1968. The left ordinate represents the specimen surface which was exposed to free-flowing fuel salt. If it is real, it is peculiar to the pyrolytic material. Following the usual sharp drop in concentration for the first few mils of depth, we see the surprising rise in concentrations for the three nuclides which have persisted as deep as 15 mils. (The 95Zr disappeared below 6 mils. ) Between 15 and 30 mils, the 144Ce concentration increases by a factor of 5, and the 103Ru and 105Nb increase an order of magnitude each. By a depth of 45 to 50 mils, the concentrations are back on their original curves. Almost certainly, this finding would be explainable by a crack or pocket into which a channel to the surface allowed salt seepage. Previously, we reported a similar situation for a core sample removed from a specimen from which some 60 mils had been removed by milling.

Resampling of the same specimen in a different location did not produce duplicate results. Again, we find this to be true: the first core from this pyrolytic specimen did not show similar behavior between 15 and 45 mills; hence, our belief that a short localized crack could cause this result.

Cerium-141, -144: The 141Ce isotope is seen to have penetrated to a greater depth from the free-flowing salt surface (left ordinate) than the 144Ce, actually being found in all samples (3. 7 hr) precursors, while all precursors of 144Ce are “short only. " Since we find no 144Ce beyond 15 mils from the left ordinate, perhaps the difference in precursors for the two cerium isotopes is a clue to the mechanism of cerium migration in some types of graphitic.

The nuclide concentrations, omitted for ease of illustration (from 70 to 340 mils), are flat over this interval. Comparison with results in figure 19 shows that fission product penetration was not appreciably inhibited by the shallow impregnation used for this specimen.

Fission product concentrations in the two pieces of CGB graphite were similar. One exception was that 95Zr was found as deep as 285 mils in the V-28 specimen, but only to a depth of 95 mils in the P-55 specimen, both measurements being from the free-flowing salt surface. Another difference between the two is noted for 144Ce; apparently, this isotope penetrated the impregnated specimen more easily than the unimpregnated one.

During grinding of the core from this specimen, we noted a crack across the face of the core following removal of 1 mil between 4 and 5 mils from the back (stagnant salt) surface. This was evident for two or three more mils in approach to the surface, and most likely accounts for the sharp drop in nuclide concentrations near the surface. This conclusion, of course, presupposes that the crack was empty, which could reasonably be expected since loose material would fall out easily from a crack that opened out at the surface.

In Table 11.6, we find a summation of atoms from 1 cm of specimen surface through to the other side of the specimen, as represented by a core for the May 1967 specimens. These are repeated to allow comparisons with the March 1968 specimens. As noted, the first core taken from the pyrolytic graphite was missing one hot surface: that surface in contact with the stagnant MSRE fuel salt. The amount of 105Zr is seen to be far less in the more recent samples, while the 105Nb is larger. Values for 101Ru are all similar. Ruthenium-106 was detected in only one surface of pyrolytic graphite, to a depth of 15 mils. Except for the pyrolytic specimen, which contained virtually no 137Cs, values are identical. The 141/144Ce values are fairly comparable. As expected, 140Ba was quite mobile in the CGB material. We plan to obtain a uranium profile on samples from the V-28 specimen to allow us to adjust the nuclide concentrations we found by the amounts that could have been made by fissioning in place.

Exposure was moved across a beam of 2.06-MeV protons collimated through a slit of 0.0075 cm width. The protons were from the ORNL 3-MeV Van de Graaff accelerator. Measurement of the resulting prompt gamma rays from 19F(p,αγ)16O showed that fluorine varied from 350 ppm near the surface to 60 ppm near the center. The observed ratio of fluorine to lithium was near that characteristic of the MSRE fuel. The lithium and fluorine concentrations did not show a simple dependence on depth.

The method and apparatus were the same as those described earlier, with minor adjustments of technique and data handling. A 3x3 in. NaI(Tl) spectrometer with a 2.5-cm lead filter was used for the gamma-ray measurements. An attempt to use a new standard of graphite mixed with known amounts (in the ppm range) of LiF was unsuccessful due to inhomogeneities, which caused yield changes of up to 100% for changes in beam spot location of 0. 0075 cm. Thereafter, the standard used was a crystal of LiF.

The concentrations of lithium and fluorine in the sample (X-13 from the middle of the core) showed substantial variation and fluctuation from position 11.22. They are for a freshly abraded cross-section from a cored sample. This was prepared by carefully abrading away 5-15 mils. The motion against the abrasive paper was kept parallel to the surface exposed to fuel to avoid possible carry-over of material from one depth to another.

Dispersions of metals of colloidal dimensions have been prepared in lithium-beryllium fluoride by three methods: reductive electrolysis, Bredig molybdenum, and nickel colloids have been prepared. The idea is to reduce the metal. Satisfactory results, however, were achieved by striking an arc between one electrode and the solution interface. Alternating-current electrolysis gives by far the most stable sols and is surely the most novel and interesting, although the mechanism of formation by this method is still quite obscure. We discovered it quite accidentally while running the blank for the Bredig arc method.

Output of a 110-V Variac through a series resistor across the electrolysis cell. The cell is (again) two identical wires 1 to 1% cm apart immersed in molten Li₂BeF₄. Helium is usually swept through the solution to provide both an inert atmosphere and agitation.

None of these colloids were particularly stable, but if the sol were filtered immediately after formation, most of the dark material readily passed a sintered glass D (5-μm nominal pore size) filter. Platinum and titanium sols coagulated readily in less than 20 min. Nickel and niobium sols were more stable, but they generally lasted less than an hour. The molybdenum and gold sols were the most stable. Gold formed a particularly satisfactory sol since, due to the reddish-purple color, we knew we were dealing with a metal sol. Sols made by the reductive electrolysis method seemed noticeably less stable than those made by the other two methods.

Samples of the molybdenum sols were centrifuged at high temperatures. After cooling, the end of the frozen salt ingot was cut off and examined microscopically and also subjected to electron microscope examination. The ingots were also analyzed spectroscopically. The usual molybdenum content was 20 to 30 ppm overall; however, the lower end of the centrifuged specimens often ran as high as 50 ppm.

The three quantities calculated are: s, the distance traveled by a particle of radius in 1 hr, calculated from Stokes law; x, the displacement of a particle of radius r due to Brownian motion; and A, the height at which after infinite time (sedimentation equilibrium) half the particles will be below the height and half will be above. Sedimentation equilibrium cannot be hoped for in the currently available centrifuge because of vibration. The table serves to show that centrifugation cannot concentrate aggregates much less.

We obtained only one picture of the particles from the AC electrolysis. It showed one agglomerate about 10,000 Å across. The individual particles were again quite small, 100 to 200 Å in diameter. While we were unable to discern the electron.

In the diffraction pattern of molybdenum, we could see than 1000 Å across. We expected that the aggregates would be flocs of smaller particles which could be distinguished by electron microscopy. The analysis of the top portions of the centrifuged ingots showed either that many of the particles were below this size or that there were some soluble molybdenum compounds in these preparations. The electron microscope picture showed that reductive electrolysis produced irregular size particles which varied from the smallest discernible, ~200 Å in diameter, to large square particles 15,000 Å across.

Mechanisms whereby these colloids get into the gas phase have also been studied. An extensive literature search was completed and supplemented by a scouting experiment. Generally, jet droplets from bursting bubbles, which are an important factor in entrainment, are one-tenth the volume of the bubble and rise to considerable heights above the liquid surface. We were able to show that this height for a molten salt (LiNO3-KNO3 eutectic) was 10 cm, and further that the droplets would also act as a surface microtome, skimming finely divided carbon from the melt surface. The jet droplet behavior of the salt melts was nicely approximated by a 50% glycerol-water mixture. An ORNL report has been prepared on this subject.

Previously reported studies of molybdenum fluoride chemistry in the Reactor Chemistry Division, along with the reasons for initiating this work, may be found in references 1-8.

The system leaves the pure MoF. Additional studies of this process have revealed that the solid resulting from the disproportionation of MoF depends on the pressure of MoF maintained in the reaction vessel. If the MoF pressure was kept in the micron range, the solid produced was MoF. If much higher pressures, in the order of an atmosphere, were maintained, the solid product was MoF, which displays 20 values for the three most intense x-ray diffraction peaks (copper radiation). The pattern for this material is very similar to that incorrectly reported for MoF several years before a satisfactory preparation was studied. Analysis of the MoF gave 55. 9 wt% Mo and 44. 0 wt% F, compared with calculated values of 55. 8 and 44. 2, respectively. The results for temperatures above 2000°C are somewhat uncertain because the Pyrex container was attacked by the fluorides. Accordingly, these stability studies must be repeated in a metal container.

It was indicated above that the products of an MoF synthesis were unusually dependent on experimental conditions. Apparently, the RuF and MoF compounds are analogous in this respect. The RuF produced will be used in investigations of the rate of removal of Ru3 from molten 2LiFBeF and MSR fuels, paralleling the Mo3 kinetic.

It has become apparent that the initial removal rate at 700°C is strongly enhanced by the hydrogen firing step, which was used on new batches but not thereafter. This observation will require a reinterpretation of earlier data. Experiments without hydrogen firing will provide a better reference system for kinetic studies involving MSR materials since the gas is not involved in the reactor chemistry. The most stable conditions encountered thus far are 500°C with a static helium atmosphere in which the concentration of Mo dropped by a factor of 4 in 1400 hr. The previously reported evidence that Mo was not removed from the solution by reaction with the copper container indicated that a disproportionation reaction was involved.

Compounds are thermally unstable in bulk at temperatures well below 500 to 700°C. It was proposed that the reaction 2MoF → Mo + MoF₂ occurred. However, efforts to collect the volatile species by trapping it in aqueous caustic solution were unsuccessful. In one case, the spectrophotometric cell was at room temperature, obviating the detection of species not volatile at room temperature.

Known from our own work in cooperation with J. P. Young that MoF does not have a high enough vapor pressure at room temperature to be detected in a 5-cm quartz cell by absorption spectroscopy. In the second case, a windowless cell was used; the optical path was at melt temperature.

Clearly volatile material could easily escape from the path. Mass spectrometric studies of pure MoF have shown that the gas escaping from a Knudsen cell in the temperature range 500 to 700°C was predominantly MoF, with lesser amounts of both MoF and MoF. Also, on opening the systems used for the kinetic studies, a blue coating typical of MoF hydrolysis product was found in the portion of the gas outlet line that was warmer than room temperature. This observation suggests that a volatile molybdenum compound did escape from the melt, condensed at lower temperature in the hot line, and hydrolyzed when the system was exposed to air at the end of the run. Further attempts to identify these gases will involve collecting them from hot exit lines rather than at room temperature and monitoring LiF-BeF-MoF mixtures with the mass spectrometer.

Even though many details of the behavior of Mo3 in molten 2LiF-BeF2 are poorly understood, the system is stable enough to serve as a reference for kinetic studies involving MSR fuels, graphite, and INOR-8; which we will now run in parallel with studies of the simpler system.

Phase diagrams of the systems of principal interest as possible coolants for molten-salt reactors have been published, but additional data have been obtained, and in some cases, the studies are still not complete. Part of the need for continuing the investigation of some systems results from the fact that much of the data was obtained with NaBF preparations less pure than that now available. The influence of impurities in the NaBF on liquidus and solidus temperatures is, unfortunately.

In the previous progress report, it was noted that our data on the system NaF-KBF4 provided evidence of non-ideality. The conclusion was based on one liquidus temperature in the high-NaF portion of the system that was considerably below the liquidus curve we had drawn for this diagram.

The system NaBF |-KBF. Differential thermal analysis data with compositions containing 80, 85, and 90 mole % NaBF (high-purity material) showed liquidus and solidus temperatures about 3 to 5°C higher than values obtained earlier with less pure NaBF. The minimum solidus temperature in this solid solution system is now believed to be 396 ± 2°C, and the minimum melting composition contains approximately 90 mole % NaBF.

Preparation and Thermal Properties of KBF3OH. Since oxygen was an impurity in all NaBF3 preparations made by aqueous methods, and these preparations exhibited low melting points, we suspected that hydrolysis products such as NaBF3OH might be responsible for the observed melting-point lowering. The hydroxy fluoroborates, if present in coolant mixtures, would be expected to be more corrosive than the pure fluoroborates. Although prepared the latter first because it proved to be easier to synthesize.

Pawlenko reported a melting point of 332°C for this compound. The DTA curves that we obtained with our preparation were difficult to interpret, but the liquidus temperature appeared to be 355°C, and other thermal effects on heating were observed; an undercooled liquidus break may have been interpreted by Pawlenko to be the liquidus temperature. Pawlenko investigated phase relations in the system.

Fluoroborates undergo pronounced crystalline transitions. Sodium tetrafluoroborate crystallizes from melts as a cubic phase, which inverts on cooling to temperatures below 240°C to an orthorhombic form, which is "20% more dense than the higher-temperature cubic form. " Such behavior indicates that the crystal chemistry of the alkali fluoroborates may be of significance in molten-salt reactor coolant technology and has prompted a reexamination of the structure of NaBF4. Lattice parameters and atomic parameters of the compound were remeasured. The refined parameters were found to be only slightly different from those determined by Weiss and Zohner from two-dimensional Weissenberg data. The orthorhombic form of NaBF4 crystallizes in the space group Cmcm, refined values for the unit cell.

The structure is shown in Fig. 12. 4. The BF₄ tetrahedra are slightly irregular, with two F(1)− ions 0. 006 Å more distant from the B⁺ ion than the two F(2)− ions. The Na ions are coordinated by 8 F⁻ ions at the corners of an irregular polyhedron, which is neither a cube nor an antiprism. The Na polyhedron shares opposite edges with BF₄ tetrahedra, four corners with BF₄ tetrahedra, and edges with two other Na polyhedra.

The entropy of the transition of KBF2 is almost double that of NaBF3. This is explained qualitatively on the basis of the differing structures of the low-temperature solids; whereas the high-temperature solids both presumably have the cubic structure.

In a closed apparatus of known volume, BF, pressures in equilibrium with the melt were measured manometrically in the composition range 15.7 to ~100 mole % KBF4. For each composition, pressures were measured over at least a 140° temperature interval within overall limits of 628 to.

The derived enthalpy and entropy were 29,800 cal and 26.4 cal/°K. The relative magnitudes of the thermodynamic quantities for the two reactions (1) and (4) seem plausible. In both reactions, ΔS° is mostly due to the expansion of a mole of BF3 in the melt to a mole of vapor; hence, it is not surprising that the reaction entropies are virtually the same. The larger values of ΔH for reaction (1) can be explained in terms of the fluoride-donor prop.

Properties of the two alkali ions. In forming the complex ion BF₆²⁻, the potassium ion, with its weaker electric field strength, donates fluoride ions more easily than sodium. Therefore, BF₆²⁻ ions are more stable in the presence of potassium ions. This margin of stability is approximately equal to the difference in the enthalpies of the dissociation reactions.

The activity coefficients of KBF4 and KF were derived at several temperatures from the vapor pressure data. 12. 6. In fact, it is usually true that binary melts which consist of a common alkali cation and differing univalent anions exhibit positive deviations.

The basic method was to determine the top surface of a column of melt. The nickel vessel containing the salt was a cylindrical cup at its lower section and a conical top welded to a relatively long chimney as its upper section. The purpose of the conical top was to permit easy escape of gas bubbles from the melt. The vessel was loaded with enough salt so that the melt filled the lower portion of the chimney. The probe, a sharp-pointed nickel rod, entered the chimney through a Teflon bushing tightened to the top of the chimney. At each fixed temperature, the probe was caused to contact the liquid surface several times, each point of contact seen by the deflection of a pointer of a vacuum-tube volt-ohmmeter. From machined lines on the probe (above the chimney), the vertical displacement of the probe was determined to 0.1 mm by means of a cathetometer.

In a series of tests which sought to determine if the proposed MSRE substitute coolant, NaBF c NaF (92-8 mole %), reacted with Hastelloy N or any of its major constituents, it was found that chromium was the only metal to exhibit a significant degree of corrosion. In this test, shiny chromium chips were immersed in the melt for 837 hours at 600°C.

In a nickel vessel, which was open only to a pressure measuring device, in the course of the test (at 600°C), the vapor pressure of BF3 rose from an initial 170 torrs to a final pressure of 280 torrs. Post-exposure examination revealed two reaction products: (1) gray material adhering strongly to the surface of the chromium chips, and (2) green crystalline Na2CrF6 mixed with the unreacted fluoroborate salt.

The oxidation of chromium to the trivalent state in Na2CrF6 required that a chemical species in contact with the chromium metal be reduced. The most likely species was boron; that is, some of the trivalent boron in NaBF4 was reduced to elemental boron or to a boride. Spectroscopic analysis of some of the gray surface material showed 2 to 5 wt% boron.

CrB represents the gray material and is a compound or mixture of undetermined stoichiometry. X-ray diffraction analysis failed to identify the gray material in terms of known chromium-boron compounds. The second reaction not only described the observed formation of NaCrF3 but also indicated a decreased thermodynamic activity of NaF in the melt, which resulted in an increased vapor pressure of BF3.

The chromium metal was also examined metallographically. The photomicrographs showed that the corrosion was confined to a rather shallow depth, approximately 10 mils. Further, the uncorroded metal did not exhibit voids; that is, vacancies which formed in the corrosion layers did not serve as a sink for chromium atoms diffusing from the unreacted portions of the lattice. Thus, the metallographic examination suggests that in chromium metal, the corrosion product (represented as CrB) acts as an impediment to further reaction by fluoroborate.

To examine this problem, cerous fluoride containing 44Ce (285-day) tracer was used to determine the solubility of CeF2 in a variety of molten fluoride salt mixtures. This material was prepared from cerous chloride solution to which 10 mc of 144Ce was added as the chloride. Ammonium bifluoride was added to precipitate CeF2, which was.

An excess of the labeled CeF2 was added to about 200 g of experimental salt, and the mixture was then melted and purified to remove oxides by passing through HF, He, and H2. The equilibrated clean solution was sampled at temperature using a copper frit filter stick technique. Recovered specimens were then analyzed.

Counting and by wet chemical analysis for their cerium content. From this information, the composition was calculated and plotted as the log of concentration vs the reciprocal of the temperature. There appears to be very good agreement between the results obtained by the two methods of analysis.

Temperature range in each case starts 50° above the melting point. The range of temperatures examined was from 525 to 800°C. The solubility of CeF2 increases regularly with increasing temperature for all the cases examined. Results are listed in Table 12.2 along with the heats of solution calculated from the relation.

We have previously reported that we observed the solubility of thorium metal in molten LiF-ThF2 (7327 mole %) at 620°C to be approximately 2. 0 mole %, with no visible sign of alloying of the nickel of the container by the thorium through the medium of the melt. This result was contrary to the findings by Barton and Stone of extensive alloying. A possible explanation of the discrepancy was the absence of gas-stirring in our experiments. Repeating the experiment with continuous argon gas-stirring, we have now corroborated the findings of Barton and Stone. In the products of the extensive attack by the dissolved thorium on the nickel container, two nickel-rich phases of the five known intermetallic nickel-thorium compounds have been positively identified: namely, ThNi, as the major and ThNi as a minor constituent, with some x-ray reflections still remaining to be identified. The great importance of the stirring reflects the low solubility of the thorium metal in the salt melt.

The particular form in which thorium metal dissolves in the fluoride melt is yet to be determined. A mechanism has been proposed whereby alloying with the nickel of the container takes place by disproportionation of a soluble subvalent thorium species formed by the reaction of thorium metal with Th ion in the melt. However, while thorium species of lower valency have been reported for chloride and iodide melts, the presence of sub-valent thorium species in fluoride melts remains uncertain.

The specific heat of the liquid is then the derivative of the last equation, or 0.324 cal g-1 (°C)-1, with an estimated error of +2%. There is no isothermal heat of fusion for the mixture. According to the phase diagram, initial melting begins at about 445°C and continues as the temperature is increased to 500°C, at which point it is completely liquid. No experimental points were obtained in the temperature interval 445 to 500°C. However, if the heat content of the solid is extrapolated to 500°C, a heat of fusion of 59 cal/g can be calculated by treating the data as if all the melting occurred at this liquidus temperature.

The specific heats and heats of fusion of various fuel salt mixtures have been estimated. The validity of our methods of estimation has been confirmed by comparison with our measurements as well as those for a number of other mixtures containing fluorides of lithium, beryllium, and thorium.

For measurements of conductance in molten fluorides, the entire assembly shown in Fig.9 was immersed in a stirred molten KNO bath. A specially constructed measuring bridge containing a series-component balancing arm determined resistance as a function of frequency. With this experimental arrangement, the measured resistance was stable, independent of the depth of cell immersion, and varied less than 0. 5% over the frequency range 1 to 10 kilohertz; the variation being approximately linear in f1/2. 3% lower than the 10-kilohertz values.

The variation of activation energy for conductance at low temperatures has been interpreted by Angell in terms of a model based on a theoretical glass transition temperature, which incorporates a non-Arrhenius form for the temperature dependence of transport properties. While there is as yet no completely satisfactory theoretical justification for the proposed equations, they have led to striking correlations in a number of systems. Since the eutectic composition of 52 mole % BeF presents the largest temperature range, we have estimated the glass transition temperature for this composition.

The conventional Arrhenius energy of activation for specific conductance, E, and the expansivity, a, should be linear with slope kR and pass through the origin. Ty is the zero mobility temperature (in °K), and k is a constant related to the potential energy of minimum-sized cooperatively rearranging groups. Figure 12. 12 shows such a series of plots for different values of Ty. (Values of Ty were obtained from density data in fused fluoride melts. ) These plots result in a fit of the data corresponding to Ty = 325 + 25 K.

In conjunction with a report on the physical properties of molten salts of interest to the Molten-Salt Reactor Program, the electrical conductivities of six fused fluorides have been estimated as functions of temperature. The results are listed in.

Data on analogous or related molten-salt systems provided a basis for the estimates. Often the assumptions were not those which seemed chemically most reasonable, but those which resulted in the best correlation of the available data for the analog systems. Therefore, estimated values of specific conductance, σ, are believed to be relatively accurate.

Where (1/a) is the cell constant. As has been pointed out previously, for a given apparatus and set of experimental conditions, the measured value of resistance can vary with the frequency of the applied potential waveform. The values of k listed in the table are valid for resistance extrapolated to infinite frequency (denoted as R∞). Thus, predicting the resistance of a melt, which will be measured in a particular experimental arrangement, not only requires a value for conductivity (σ) but also presupposes knowledge of the frequency dispersion characteristics of the measuring device.

As reported previously, the Be|Be and the HF, H2|F7 electrodes are stable reference electrodes for use in LiF-BeF2 mixtures. However, both electrodes have disadvantages. Because of the strong reducing power of the Be|Be electrode, it is easily poisoned by impurities or solutes which are reduced and deposited as metals on the electrode surface. Hence, it is necessary to maintain the melt in the vicinity of this electrode quite free of such reducible substances. This electrode can also develop dendritic crystals of beryllium metal on its surface as a result of mass transfer, and these can short the electrode to the cell wall if adequate clearance has not been provided. A more serious disadvantage of this electrode is that hydrogen is a reactive, rapidly diffusing gas which is hard to confine to the vicinity of the electrode.

Since all the reactants and products are of fixed activity, the measured cell potential should be the standard potential E°, which is a function only of temperature. X-ray analysis has confirmed that NiO, BeO, and LiF-BeF2 (66-34) are indeed the only constituents in the Ni2|Ni electrode compartment.

The reaction vessel used for our experiments was constructed of 24-inch nickel pipe separated into two compartments by a ½-inch nickel sheet welded down through the center. Melt contact between the two compartments was provided by a ½-inch-diameter compartment of the reaction vessel was fitted with an entry port for an electrode, a gas sparging line, and a thermocouple well. The Ni|Ni electrode was further compartmented to contain the oxides and the dissolved NiF2. The beryllium electrode was used without any compartmentation.

Our early potentiometric measurements of the above cell were made using a Ni2|Ni compartment constructed of copper tubing with a copper frit (25- to 40-porosity) welded on the lower end. Excess BeO and NiO were added to the nickel electrode compartment. The LiF-BeF2 solution was then forced by a small gas pressure into the compartment through the copper frit. A nickel tube served as the nickel electrode and also permitted.

Cell potentials were erratic, but on various occasions, we were able to achieve stable potentials for as long as 24 hours. The major difficulty encountered was that the cell potential would reach a maximum value, then would begin drifting toward a low value. Two possible causes of this behavior.

The nickel electrode was polarized by intermittent shorting to the copper compartment, resulting in the reduction of Ni2 on the copper to form a Cu-Ni alloy, or Ni2 diffused through the copper frit at too rapid a rate. To investigate the first possibility, a compartment was constructed of nickel tubing sheathed in copper containing both nickel and copper frits. Cell potentials obtained using this compartment were somewhat more consistent, but potential drifts toward a low value were still encountered. To address the second possible difficulty, we have recently obtained a much denser (6- to 14-y porosity) copper frit material fabricated by the Gaseous Diffusion Development Division at K-25 and are having compartments fabricated using this material. It is hoped that these less porous frits will reduce or eliminate any appreciable diffusion.

The Ni-Ni electrode described above shows promise for use as a reference electrode in molten fluorides.

Of ions in molten fluoride solvents. There is, however, a need for a container or cell with fixed transparent windows. Such a container would provide a fixed and easily determined path length, the facility to bubble the melt with reactive gases, and better containment of volatile species. The problems encountered with such a cell have been to find windows that were optically transparent in the spectral range 200 to 2500 nm and which would resist the extremely corrosive action of molten fluorides. Also, it must be convenient to use so that the long-term applications of it to fluoride problems would be practical.

Diamonds, a sleeve that holds the retainers in place, and a nut to secure the sleeve. The optical path length between the diamonds is 1.0 cm. The diamond windows are approximately 5 x 5 x 1 mm type IIa plates. Some variation in the diamond size from the above nominal value is unavoidable. Consequently, the cell design allows appreciable variations in the window dimensions.

Positioning of a window in the cell is achieved by means of a horizontal groove on the body, which fixes the vertical position, and a vertical groove on the retainer, which fixes the horizontal position. The depth of each groove is one-half the window thickness (nominally 1 mm); while the width of each groove is, of course, the same as the width of the window, 5 mm. With this arrangement, the windows are not sealed gastight to the cell body but merely fit flush to the body with a force of a few grams exerted upon them. Fluid leakage around the windows does not occur because most molten fluoride salts do not wet graphite. The advantages of this arrangement are the simplicity of design, ease of assembly and disassembly, and no significant danger of window breakage due to loading stresses.

This cell was successfully used in a number of tests. A spectrophotometric baseline for LiF-BeF2 (66-34 mole %) and the spectra of NiF2 and UF2 in the LiF-BeF2 solvent were recorded. Because of the reproducibility of the baseline achieved with the diamond cell, a broad peak centered at 2.06 y in the UF2 solution spectrum was identified for the first time in a molten fluoride in non-corrosive systems before but has not been.

Spectral studies of dilute solutions of MoF2 in molten LiF-BeF2 (66-34 mole %) (hereafter referred to as "LB") have continued in order to demonstrate both the valence state and coordination of the molybdenum species. Peaks at 472 and 353 nm with molar absorptivities of about 8 and 12 liters mole−1 cm−1, respectively, have been observed. The positions of these two transitions are consistent with what is predicted from the spectrochemical series. On this basis, it is possible to say that MoF2 in LB is present as Mo3 ions, which are octahedrally coordinated to fluoride ions.

For these studies, the melts have been contained in windowless cells made from graphite, platinum, molybdenum, or copper. The variety of container materials was used in an unsuccessful effort to maintain stable MoF solutions. Molybdenum was invariably lost from the solution after 24 hours at 700°C due to an unexplained mechanism. Experience with the system has led us to believe that impurity reactions were involved.

K₂MoF₆ was prepared by mixing stoichiometric quantities of KF and MoF₅ (ref. 65), and fusing in a sealed platinum tube at 880°C for half an hour. A low (about 5%) yield of the product was obtained in the form of small crystals, which measured approximately 0.3 mm in diameter. These crystals were handpicked and washed with ethanol and/or acetone.

The diffuse reflectance spectrum of the crystals reveals peaks at 264, 344, and 430 nm. The latter two peaks are assigned to the same two transitions as the bands at 350 and 470 nm in the LB solutions of MoF mentioned in the previous section. The 264-nm peak in the crystal spectrum is assigned to the highest-energy spin-allowed transition of a 4d3 ion in octahedral symmetry. In the LBMoF melt spectrum, this band is hidden by the foot of an intense charge-transfer band.

With the crystal structure determination, the Mo3 ion in KMoF6 is surrounded in octahedral symmetry by six fluoride ligands as MoF63-. A comparison between its spectrum and that of the high-temperature MoF6 in LB gives concluding evidence that the species present in the MoF6-LB solution is MoF37.

We sought to support this argument by measuring the spectrum of MoF in the gas phase over a solution of MoF in LB. MoF has a strong charge-transfer absorption in the 200-nm region (ε = 10% liters mole−1 cm−1), with a vibrational structure that provides a fingerprint for identification.

Initial attempts to measure MoF directly over the melt in a windowless container at 550 to 700°C revealed no vapor species contributing a charge-transfer spectrum. Because we knew neither our sensitivity limits nor the reason for losses of molybdenum from the MoF solutions, we refined our approach in the following manner.

The second-order rate constant data of Weaver, Hess, and Friedman indicates that 1000 ppm of MoF in LB would have an equilibrium pressure of at least 1 torr. A calibration of our system with MoF gas showed that we could detect MoF at pressures as low as 0.020 torr.

The procedure was simply to maintain an LB solution of MoF at 700°C or greater in an appendix tube attached to the 10-cm-path-length gas cell fitted with quartz windows. The gas cell was kept at room temperature and fitted into the sample compartment of a Cary model 14 spectrometer. Any MoF generated in the hot appendix tube was then expected to diffuse into the gas cell where its spectrum could be measured.

First, MoF was introduced to demonstrate that pressures as low as 0.020 to 0.050 torr were stable in the appendix tube and held at 700°C. Afterward, visual observation indicated that these solutions were stable. Under no conditions was MoF evolution from the solution observed — not even when the solution temperature was raised to 900°C.

When such is equilibrated with Li, BeF2 containing up to 7 mol% ThF4, this two-phase distribution, which may be viewed as a solvent extraction system in which one of the phases is a solid solution, is being studied further because of its obvious relevance to the oxide chemistry of a single-fluid MSBR fuel and because of its potential value as a fuel reprocessing method.

In the present measurements, a stirred, gas-tight vessel is being used. The cover gas is argon, which is recirculated at 10 psig in a closed system by means of a finger pump. This gas system includes a drying tube and an infrared absorption cell, which can be used to detect the CO produced by any inleakage and reaction of air with traces of graphite present in the salt. A titration procedure is being used in which UO2 or ThO2 is added in increments to LiF-BeF2-ThF4 (72-16-12 mole %) in order to vary the composition of the oxide phase. The fluoride phase is sampled frequently to determine the course of the U-Th distribution.

The values of Q (as defined above for reaction (1)) were calculated from the analytical value of the U4 concentration in the salt phase, Xen, and also the values of Xucoy, Xencoy, and Xonct, which can be deduced quite accurately by material balance. The value of Q finally reached here is consistent with the previously reported estimate.

In the steps, the U concentration in the salt phase was found to decrease, rise, and then decrease again, but equilibrium probably was not obtained in these steps because of the large amount of oxide to be equilibrated and the small concentration of uranium-70 in the fluoride phase. The interesting kinetic behavior observed following both UO2 and ThO2 additions probably reflects the combined effects of nonuniform oxide composition and changing particle size before equilibrium is reached. In future measurements, an effort will be made to hasten the approach to equilibrium by the use of more vigorous stirring as well as lower oxide-to-fluoride phase ratios.

In continuing these studies, we have measured the lower equilibrium partial pressures of SiF4 produced when the ratio of BeO/SiO2 in the solids is increased. With the BeO/SiO2 ratio near 2 (the composition of phenacite), the system was very slow to reach equilibrium.

Combining the heats of reaction (1) and (3), the slope of the lower dashed line in 0.15 is given by ΔH(2), while the intercept of the line is fixed by the requirement that it intersect with the upper line corresponding to reaction (1) at the temperature at which phenacite decomposes by the reverse of reaction (3). Morgan and Hummel report this decomposition temperature to be 1560°C. The resulting calculated expression for the partial pressure of SiF2 is.

The data actually obtained above 700°C are seen to agree quite well with the predicted behavior. Below this temperature, however, the measured pressures are increasingly higher than the predicted values. One explanation for this effect would be the appearance of a new solid phase below 700°C, one in which the BeO/SiO2 ratio is greater than 2 and which perhaps contains fluoride. Silicates of Ca, Ba, and Sr are known in which the MO/SiO2 ratio is 3, but such are not known for Mg or Be. Furthermore, we have been unable to produce readily detectable amounts of such a new compound in mixtures of SiO2, Be, SiO2, and BeO equilibrated with Li, BeF2 at 625 to 650°C for as much as 30 days.

Another possible explanation is the existence of a previously unsuspected solid-state transition in BeO occurring at or below 700°C with a transition heat of ~4 kcal/mole. To our knowledge, however, no other evidence of such a transition exists. In fact, in our measurements, the same powder pattern has been found for BeO samples equilibrated above and below 700°C, and it agrees with that reported in the literature. Hence, the possibility of a transition in BeO seems unlikely.

Whatever the explanation of this somewhat high value of P, below 700°C in the latest measurements, the chemistry of silica in LiF-BeF2 melts is now fairly well defined. In future measurements, we plan to study the ion exchange properties of Be, SiO2, which has an open structure. Further, we wish to explore rare-earth-containing silicates, which might be produced by equilibration of Be, SiO2 with LiF-BeF2 melts containing rare earth.

It was shown earlier that protactinium could be extracted successfully from the two-region molten-salt breeder reactor blanket salt, and that in transport between two salts through a metal, the material balance could be maintained. The extraction of protactinium at tracer level from the single-region breeder salt mixture into bismuth has now been demonstrated as well.

Added to an all-graphite vessel containing 3. 00 kg, by the end of this time, 70. 4% of the protactinium was in the metal, and 23. 4% was in the salt, for an overall. When all was restored to normal, the salt was hydrofluorinated to reoxidize the protactinium. Only about 67% of it could be gotten into the salt. The experiment was continued at 700°C, but the balance was only 65 to 83% of the original and began to fall when D reached 2. In the thought that some iron from the vessel top had reached the liquids by refluxing vapors during the temperature excursion, 189 g of tin was added to raise iron solubility. It seemed that this experiment, which had started so promisingly, had been ruined by the temperature.

The experiment was repeated with 3.15 kg of the same salt containing 0.3 mol% UF. Again, 3 kg of bismuth was used in an all-graphite apparatus. Thorium metal was added as a reductant, and samples were taken at 600 and 700°C after each addition. The uranium balance remained good throughout the experiment. The protactinium balance was very good until about 40% of it had been extracted (D50 ~ 2); then it began to decline rather sharply. It was thought that thorium solubility had been reached, and the experiment was terminated, but it turned out that this was not the case, at least if thorium solubility in a mixed system with uranium is the same as in bismuth alone.

In this experiment, contrary to what had been found earlier, the valence 3 fitted uranium better than 4. It also fitted protactinium somewhat better, but 4 was used in the calculations. The apparent thorium valence, compared with the lithium valence of 1, was about 1. 5 throughout the experiment from Dow = 0.00018 to 0.017. There were some rather larger discrepancies in some of the lithium and thorium analyses performed by two different methods on the same samples, and this may account for some of this strange behavior. It may not be entirely unreal, however, since several rare-earth extraction experiments show an apparently low thorium valence at high thorium mole fraction in bismuth. In comparison with the results reported earlier for the two-region blanket salt, the thorium-protactinium separation is harder but is still quite feasible, while the protactinium-uranium separation is easier. Because of the thorium valence anomaly, its values should be used cautiously.

Inasmuch as the composition of the single-region breeder fuel salt has not been definitively established, a protactinium extraction was carried out in a salt with a lower free fluoride concentration, LiF-BeF2-ThF4 (68-20-12 mole %). About 4.14 kg of this salt containing 41 g of UF6 was extracted in an all-graphite vessel with 3.00 kg of high-purity bismuth using thorium metal as a reductant at 600 and 700°C. At several points in the experiment, the phases were sampled at about 2, 4, and 20 hr after the metal addition to see whether there was any loss of reduced metals with time. The only change of significance was at the highest thorium concentration when the protactinium distribution tripled over this period of time, most of the rise coming between the first two samplings. This is perhaps due to slow dissolution of thorium bismuthide in the high-thorium solution. No significant losses of reduced metals were detected at any point.

These tracer-level experiments indicate that protactinium can be extracted from single-region salts of various compositions. The protactinium activity is rather strongly influenced by the salt composition, and further work will be needed to define the nature of this dependence. The problem of protactinium balance is still with us, but protactinium disappearance seems to vary from experiment to experiment. In the first of the above, the balance was quite good; until the accident in the second, it persisted to a very high distribution ratio. Since there is no consistent pattern to the disappearance, we suspect that the tiny amount of material is attaching itself to some speck of contaminant and that this will not be a problem when reasonable amounts of protactinium are used.

Since beryllium does not form intermetallic compounds with bismuth and is essentially insoluble in bismuth at temperatures of interest to this program, its presence in the salt mixture does not have a direct effect on the reductive extraction process. Separation factors obtained from Eq. However, separations obtained from Eq. (2) are less favorable and may only be marginally feasible for removing certain of the rare-earth fission product species. In addition, the degree to which rare earths can be extracted per equilibrium stage depends on the concentrations of reduced species in solution in the bismuth, a measure of the reduction potential of the system. Since thorium metal forms an intermetallic compound with bismuth, the reduction potential of the system is limited to relatively low values which correspond to its solubility in the bismuth pool.

Since separation factors and distribution coefficients for the reductive extraction process are based on chemical concentrations, not thermodynamic activities, they may be altered by imposing changes in the activity coefficients of the chemical species in the two liquid phases. Accordingly, this experimental program is currently directed toward a chemical evaluation of the reductive extraction process with respect to salt solvent composition and metal phase composition for the various important rare-earth fission products.

The selection of the fuel solvent for the single-region molten-salt breeder reactor will consider not only the nuclear and physical characteristics of the salt mixture but also its chemical properties with respect to the reactor environment and the chemical reprocessing plant. The ternary system LiF-BeF2-ThF4 has been chosen for this application with probable thorium concentrations of 10 to 12 mol%, beryllium concentrations of 16 to 20 mol%, and the balance lithium fluoride. Within these restraints, however, activity coefficients for the individual salt constituents may be quite varied. The results of this investigation demonstrate these variations by their effects on the reductive extraction of cerium from several salt mixtures into bismuth.

When beryllium fluoride and thorium fluoride are mixed with alkali fluorides as a molten solution, they form coordinated compounds, which can be explained by a fluoride-bridging concept. This coordination may be visualized as the chemical equilibria.

In the highly ionized fluoride melt, basic ions of BeF2 and ThF4 would be formed; any unassociated ions furnished by LiF would be considered acidic. Although quantitative estimates of these coordination reactions are not available, their presence should affect the activity coefficients of the salt-phase constituents, which should, in turn, alter the equilibria of the reductive extraction process. This reference scale.

The experimental procedure was directed primarily toward the evaluation of pertinent equilibrium data according to Eq. (3). If the activity coefficients remain constant during each individual extraction experiment, then the concentrations of reaction constituents may be equated to a constant by the relation.

Of samples taken from the salt and metal phases for cerium and from spectrochemical analyses of the metal phase samples for lithium and thorium, changes in the reduction potential were made by adding lithium metal (thorium metal in two experiments) directly to the molten metal phase in small tared increments until apparent saturation of the bismuth phase by thorium was achieved. Although emphasis was placed on measurements at 600°C, experimental data were obtained over the range 500 to 800°C for some of the extraction systems.

Since the experimental data were not necessarily obtained up to the solubility limit of thorium in bismuth, the values calculated for the equilibrium quotients are useful in establishing limiting parameters of the extraction process. The solubility of thorium in bismuth has been reported by several investigators.

The composition of the fuel salt mixture will be strongly influenced by considerations other than that of optimum reprocessing. On the other hand, the metal-phase composition is subject to no restrictions except that it be noble and containable. There are two possible ways to improve the separation. If the rare-earth activity could be lowered and the thorium activity left unchanged, then a higher fraction of rare earth would be removed before thorium bismuthide precipitation. Both the amount removed and the separation would be improved. Thorium solubility can be increased somewhat by raising the temperature of the bismuth, but rare-earth removal is only about doubled. In 100°, a change of metal phase might help much more. Both of these possibilities are being investigated.

There seems to be no good theoretical basis for choosing a metal solvent in which rare-earth activities will be lowered still further with respect to thorium. It is quite obvious that the strong intermetallic compound formation by bismuth and rare earths is the only thing which lets the separation even be close, since reduction to the pure metals would take thorium out much earlier. Some very limited experience with extracting rare earths from LiF-BeF2 (66-34 mol %) into lead implies that a rare-earth—thorium separation would be worse in this system than in bismuth. Lead is less electronegative than bismuth and forms weaker intermetallics. This finding suggests that more electronegative metals should be tried as solvents or as major additives to the bismuth.

One metal that should form stronger compounds is antimony. Its melting point of 630°C is too high for it to be used pure, but it can be dissolved in bismuth in large amounts. An LiF-BeF2-ThF4 (72-16-12 mole %) salt containing EuF3 was added to a graphite vessel containing Bi-Sb (79. 4-20. 6 mole %), and small amounts of metallic thorium reductant were added at 600 and 700°C. Radiochemical analysis indicated that only about 0. 4% of the europium.

Was extracted, but even this may be due to background examination of the spectrum. Taken on a multichannel analyzer showed only background at the prominent 355-keV peak of 15-154Eu. However, four measurements were made of the lithium and thorium distributions and the beryllium electrode potential. Since no absolute beryllium potential measurements have been made in this solvent, only the standard potential difference can be determined.

In the same salt with pure bismuth, the addition of antimony to the metal phase has further lowered the activities of both lithium and thorium. Though the data are not extensive enough to make these values very accurate, it seems that the thorium activity was lowered more than the lithium. In a similar experiment, an LiF-BeF2-ThF4 salt (65-23-12 mole %) containing CeF3 was extracted, and cerium was used as reductants. Potential readings were not taken. The cerium distribution, however, was measurable. It was less than half that obtained in pure bismuth with this salt. At both 600 and 700°C, the separation factor (D2/D1) was about 0. 4 at the thorium solubility limit (which was perhaps twice the reported solubility in bismuth). Table 13. 3 shows these distributions. The lithium-thorium equilibrium constant made no sense unless equal valences were assumed for both metals so no comparison with the europium experiment could be made. Antimony does not look like a good additive.

The thorium distribution at saturation at 600°C leads to a maximum neodymium distribution of 0. 05 and a separation factor of 1. 33. Thorium saturation was apparently not reached at 700°C, but a D of 0. 104 was found. The distribution of neodymium between the salt and pure bismuth is not yet known. However, an experiment now in progress using LiFBeF4-THF (72-16-12 mole %) indicates that the latter is a more favorable salt for rare-earth extraction. If D (salt B)/D (salt A) equals D (salt B)/D (salt A), then in the 72-16-12 salt we would expect D with the bismuth-gold at 700°C. This is a significant improvement even though the separation factor has been slightly reduced. The effect of gold concentration and of chemically similar but less precious additives is an object of studies to be made.

In the previous report, it was shown that the protactinium distribution that occurred when a single-region fuel composition LiF-BeF2-ThF4 (72-16-12 mole %) was equilibrated with a bismuth-thorium alloy was less favorable than when the salt phase was the blanket composition LiF-BeF2-ThF4 (73-25 mole %). This difference in protactinium behavior was apparently due to an unexplained, fairly rapid loss of thorium from the bismuth phase in the single-region fuel experiments.

In one experiment, 850 g of bismuth containing 4.25 g of thorium, part of which was irradiated to provide a tracer concentration of 233Pa, was heated to 630°C in a graphite-lined nickel pot. During the early part of the equilibration period when the bismuth was stirred with 200 cm3/min of helium, the 233Pa concentration in filtered samples increased sharply to a maximum in the 6-hr sample. There was a lower rate of decrease in the 233Pa during the next 70 hr when the cover gas was changed to static helium, thus indicating possible contamination of the helium with oxygen or water vapor. Variations in the thorium concentration in filtered bismuth samples were also noted, with a maximum value of 1680 ppm being attained, but all samples contained less thorium than the literature or than our previous experiments would predict. A graphite specimen exposed for 24 hr in the bismuth-thorium alloy was examined by x-ray diffraction. No evidence of carbide formation was found, and most of the thorium was accounted for by analyses of the bismuth ingot and the samples that were removed. We concluded that this experiment provided no indication of thorium carbide formation at 630°C.

The insoluble thorium was still effective in reducing protactinium. The uranium content of filtered bismuth ranged from 47 to 57%, and the uranium balance was much better than that of protactinium. It appears that mild steel has no advantage over graphite as a container for liquid-metal—single-region-fuel-salt equilibration experiments.

There were no obvious differences in technique between the very successful experiment with a blanket composition as the salt phase (run 1-8) and subsequent less successful experiments with single-region fuel. We made a number of improvements in our experimental technique to reduce the possibility of oxide contamination, and we decided to repeat run 1-8 under current glove box conditions to try to confirm our belief that the difference in salt composition, rather than faulty experimental technique, was the cause of different protactinium distributions. The resulting experiment (run 6-11) gave very encouraging results. The protactinium distribution data in Fig. 4 show that after 18 hours of phase contact, 58% of the protactinium was in the filtered bismuth and 35% in the filtered salt, making a total of 93%. The insoluble protactinium making up the balance was in the bismuth.

The thorium concentration in bismuth, also shown in 0.4, underwent an initial rapid drop of greater magnitude than expected from the concentration of uranium and protactinium (50 and 7 ppm respectively) initially present in the salt phase; but the rate of loss after the first hour was slow in comparison with that observed in experiments with single-region fuel salt.

The distribution of uranium in this experiment was similar to that of protactinium, except that the thorium added after 19% hr contact caused an increase in the uranium concentration in bismuth, as well as a decrease in the salt-phase concentration. The uranium balance was near 100%. The drop in protactinium balance following the addition of thorium probably indicates that part of the protactinium coprecipitated with insoluble bismuth-thorium intermetallic compounds.

With data from run 1-8, it shows that the reduction and transfer of uranium or protactinium to the bismuth phase was much slower in the recent experiment. We found that the graphite dip leg had broken at the point where the graphite was sealed to 4-in. nickel tubing.

In this experiment, we again demonstrated that protactinium and uranium can be returned to solution in the molten salt by HF-H₂ treatment in a mixture containing bismuth. After the re-solution part of the experiment was completed, we treated the mixture with hydrogen and then added enough thorium turnings to make a 1% Th-Bi alloy. The protactinium concentration in the filtered salt was down to about 3% of its initial value 30 hr after adding thorium, but a maximum of 19% was found in the bismuth.

We further tested the oxide contamination theory by conducting an experiment with the single-region fuel composition LiF-BeF2-ThF4 (72-16-12 mole %), in which we took many precautions to prevent any oxygen from entering the apparatus. The entire system was carefully leak-tested and pumped for 24 hours at room temperature. The traps were pumped overnight at about 100°C. The system was operated at a helium pressure of 12 psig. The apparatus was heated initially under vacuum, and crystal bar thorium was used as the reducing agent in place of.

The protactinium distribution in this experiment (run 7-2), shown in Fig. 13.6, indicated very little reduction during the first 30-hr equilibration period; a little more reduction during the 22-hr period following the addition of more crystal-bar thorium; and finally, a substantial increase in protactinium reduction in 24 hr after the addition of thorium turnings.

Quite similar to the protactinium data, the thorium metal content of filtered bismuth samples, also shown in Fig. 6, was quite low. This accounts for the slowness of reduction but raises the presently unanswered question of why the thorium did not dissolve in bismuth. Nickel was present as an impurity in the bismuth, resulting from splashing of the bismuth on nickel tubing well above the liquid level. Although there was evidence that insoluble nickel-thorium intermetallic compounds were formed, comparison of the results of this experiment with data obtained in the latter part of run 6-11, where the nickel concentration was more than ten times as high as in the present experiment, makes it seem unlikely that the nickel impurity alone could account for the low thorium solubility. It is known that crystal-bar thorium dissolves more slowly than turnings, and it appears that the reaction, whatever it may be, that converted the thorium into a form insoluble in the bismuth proceeded more rapidly when the metal was present as a pure solid phase than when it was dissolved in bismuth.

The final experiment, and the most successful we have conducted to date with single-region fuel salt, was performed in a molybdenum-lined vessel containing a molybdenum dip leg. Chemical Technology workers had previously demonstrated the compatibility of the material involved in this experiment, as reported elsewhere in this report. The experiment has been completed, but only preliminary data are available at present for most samples.

Protactinium distribution data, together with thorium concentrations found in the bismuth, are given in Fig. 13. 7. It is apparent that the reduction of UF6 and PaF5 was not complete when the first samples were taken about an hour after the mixing of the phases.

The very slow rate (approximately 50 ml/min) and the mixing were less vigorous than in earlier experiments. The protactinium concentration in the 2. 2-hr bismuth sample, based on the 35Pa count on the solid sample, the most reliable value available for this particular sample, was a little higher than counts obtained with subsequent samples indicated. The argon gas flow was shut off shortly after taking the 2. 3-hr salt sample, and the vessel was maintained under a positive pressure of argon for a period of 90 hr. Argon was then allowed to flow through the vessel at 50 ml/min for two days and then helium at the same rate for another day. As the data in Fig. 7 show, the protactinium concentration in both salt and bismuth remained virtually unchanged from 19 hr to the end of the equilibration period. The importance of the helium test is that it indicates that our helium supply is almost certainly free of oxygen impurities. The only purification treatment that it had received was passage through charcoal cooled with dry ice, and no change in protactinium distribution resulted from its use.

After having confirmed the long-term stability of protactinium in bismuth contained in molybdenum, we treated the mixture with H2 and HF to oxidize and dissolve the metallic uranium, protactinium, and thorium in the salt. This was followed by hydrogen reduction and by argon sparging to remove HF. We then repeated the thorium reduction process, but this time we added the thorium in increments, allowing about 24 hr between additions, with gentle argon flow to mix the phases, to assure that equilibrium was reached. The protactinium distribution data are presented in Fig. 8 as a function of weight of thorium added. The calculated weights of the phases at the first addition of thorium were 212 g for the salt and 177 g for the metal. As the data in Fig. 8 demonstrate, the protactinium content of the phases remained essentially unchanged until the thorium added was sufficient to reduce nearly all the uranium. The salt samples removed after the first two additions of thorium had a distinctly bluish color, indicative of the presence of UF3.

The calculated value for this experiment was about 1570 with a thorium concentration in the bismuth of 1400 ppm. This value is considerably lower than data reported by other investigators would indicate, but since their data show considerable scatter in the calculated Q value, it is not clear whether the difference in distribution coefficients between their experiments and ours is significant. We will get additional values for this quotient when the remaining samples from the experiment are analyzed.

Because the earlier analyses by the hydrofluorination method had established that a low and essentially constant concentration of oxide could be maintained in the MSRE fuel, the determination of oxide in the reactor salt samples was assigned a lower priority during this period of operation. The results of the two oxide analyses performed on the fuel are reported in Table 14. 1. Also included for comparison are the results obtained for an earlier sample (FP-7-9) whose analysis was deliberately delayed to accentuate the effects of radiation and the average result of all fuel analyses since the reactor achieved power operation.

While the reproducibility (+8 ppm absolute) of the combined sampling and analysis procedure is quite satisfactory, the accuracy of the method for radioactive samples is difficult to establish. A possible source of error is the loss of oxygen via evolution by radiolytic fluorine that is generated.

During the approximately 8-hour interval between sampling and analysis, Sample FP-14-53 was transported in a carrier designed to maintain the sample at a temperature above 500°F to eliminate the radiolytic generation of fluorine. Because of a crowded sampling schedule, it was not possible to perform repeated analyses on samples transported in the heated carrier before the scheduled reactor shutdown. The absence of any significant differences between the results of a sample handled to minimize and that handled to maximize the effects of radiation, together with the overall reproducibility, strongly suggests that the activity of the samples introduces no determinate error in.

During the period when the reactor was not in operation, the hydrofluorination apparatus was used to analyze a number of radioactive and non-radioactive samples. Solvent salt samples for the In-Pile Test Loop were analyzed in an effort to determine the source of oxide contamination. The results are summarized below.

The first five analyses were run to establish the optimum sampling techniques for the processing equipment on samples from a test preparation of concentrate prepared from normal uranium. The initial samples were taken in a special sampling system designed to withdraw a filtered sample in a small copper ladle. It was necessary either to transfer the sample to a standard ladle or to couple a copper sleeve to the ladle to ensure that HF-H.

The mixture bubbled through the molten sample. To provide larger and more representative samples, the molten salt was drawn into a ½-inch-OD Inconel tube. After freezing, 1-inch sections cut from the salt-filled tube were taken for analysis. These sections were placed in standard ladles that were prefitted with a welded delivery tube, which extended to the bottom of the ladle. The results confirm the effectiveness of the preliminary hydrofluorination step in the removal of surface contamination from atmospheric exposure.

The evaluation of the effects of radiation on the components of the hydrofluorination apparatus is of considerable interest because of plans to adapt the technique to the in-line analysis of radioactive salt streams. In general, the experience has been satisfactory. In this period, the third year of operation, the repair of in-cell components was needed on only three occasions. Two of these failures — leaks in the remote coupler resulting from the corrosion of nickel ball joints by fumes from an adjacent cell and an open circuit in the valve-compartment heater system — do not appear to be associated with radiation damage. The cause of the desensitization of the electrolytic moisture monitor cell, the third since the apparatus was installed, is subject to question. The first and last (present) of these cells, which were used primarily for the analysis of samples of relatively low radioactivity, survived at least 20 analyses and an 8-month service life. Conversely, the other cells, which were used for samples taken during extended power operation, failed after 4.

All failures have been of the same general type: plastic components exhibited some evidence of non-critical radiation damage, and the PO electrolyte was removed from the electrodes. In an attempt to reproduce these failures under controlled conditions, a moisture-monitor cell was operated in the vertical position at 65°C. After the repeated analysis of a series of relatively large SnO standards had failed to reduce the cell's efficiency, it was removed and subjected to ~107 rads of Co radiation. The irradiated cell continued to function for several months and finally was desensitized after the passage of a total of about 1.5 g of water. This treatment represents an exposure to both radiation and water that is at least an order of magnitude greater than that which produced in-cell failure. Although the in-cell failures may have been due to the characteristics of the individual moisture monitors, it is desirable to investigate other techniques for the measurement of water for application to in-line oxide analysis of molten-salt reactor fuels.

The theory of this method and the initial evaluation of the experimental results have been previously described. It was noted at that time that the results of the U determinations did not reflect the beryllium additions which had been made to the MSRE fuel salt for the purpose of reducing fractional percentages of the U to U.

The computer program has since been modified, and the experimental results reevaluated. The new ratios of U to total U are plotted in Fig. 14.1 and are compared with the calculated ratios that would be expected to exist by virtue of the beryllium additions and the fuel burnup. After the first sample was run, a rod of beryllium metal was lowered into the fuel in the reactor. The beryllium is oxidized by the fuel; this reaction produces an increase in the U3 concentration.

All of the increases in the calculated U concentrations are a result of more beryllium additions and corrosion of chromium, whereas the decreases are a result of fuel burnup. The analysis of the sixth and seventh samples gave HF yields in the hundreds of micromoles, which has no correlation with U concentration. At this point, difficulty was experienced with the sampler station, and the reactor was shut down for about a month and a half for maintenance. The first two U3 results determined after the reactor was brought back to power were close to the calculated values, and the result for the third sample was low.

As a result of the radiolytic production of fluorine, this hypothesis was discussed in a previous semiannual report. To eliminate this source of error, a heated sample carrier was made to transport the fuel samples from the reactor to the hotcell facilities. The carrier maintains the temperature of the sample at about 500°F to eliminate any fluorine production. Due to sampling problems at the reactor, only one U sample transported in the heated container was taken before the final reactor shutdown. The U result for this sample was low compared with the calculated value. However, due to the experimental difficulties of this method, it would be unwise to place too much credence in any single.

Work was continued on the development of the method for the remote measurement of ppm concentrations of HF in helium and in hydrogen gas streams. The construction and calibration of the dual trapping system for the continuous absorption and desorption of HF on sodium fluoride were completed. The trapping system consists of a dual selector valve, a special Monel thermal conductivity cell (Gow Mac model 9454) with nickel filaments, and two sodium fluoride traps. This arrangement permits the simultaneous absorption of HF on one trap at room temperature and the desorption of HF from the alternate trap at 300°C by means of self-resistance heating. Figure 14. The initial smaller peak is due to a small amount of water impurity and is almost completely resolved from the HF peak. As shown in Fig. the number of micromoles of HF desorbed from the traps is linear over the range of interest (1 to 50 micromoles of HF).

It will be necessary to have some means to check periodically for any deterioration in the thermal conductivity-cell response. We have found that the sampling of a helium gas stream will serve for this purpose. At a cell current of 270 mA and a flush-gas flow of 100 cc/min, the agreement of the cell responses for repetitive samplings of a pure helium gas stream was better than 0.1%. A 10% change in the flush-gas flow causes a change in the cell response of only 1%.

Provisions are now being made to use the trapping system for the analysis of the HF evolved from the hydrogen reduction of standard fuel salt mixtures.

Not applicable to radioactive samples because it requires a finely powdered sample, and no facilities are available to pulverize radioactive samples under a controlled atmosphere. A modification of this technique is being developed in which an unpulverized solid sample is dissolved in a sealed tube in an HCl-H2O mixture. We have demonstrated that concentrates are completely disintegrated by a 24hr treatment at 250°C. The sealed tube is protected by an overpressure of CO2 during the dissolution. In the hot-cell determination, the evolved hydrogen will be mixed with a standard addition of helium, and the H2/He ratio will be determined mass spectrographically. To simulate the hot cell.

Cell operation: Samples were added to a tube that was fitted with a break seal and that contained a thin-walled ampoule of deaerated acid. The tube was evacuated and sealed off by using a small (~300 W) platinum-wound furnace. The acid ampoule was then broken by shaking, and the dissolution was completed successfully. Since all these operations appear to be feasible by remote manipulation, an apparatus is being fabricated to perform the dissolutions and standard additions of helium within.

Uranium(IV) is oxidized to uranium(V) at a pyrolytic graphite electrode and at platinum-10% rhodium at ~+1.2 V vs a platinum quasi-reference electrode. The voltammograms are characteristic of catalytic waves; that is, a charge transfer followed by a chemical reaction. This is evidenced by: (1) No voltammetric currents occur that are due to the reduction of U(V) at slow scan rates (V << 1 V/sec), and (2) the peak currents for the oxidation of U(IV) and rereduction of U(V) are approximately equal at fast scan rates (V >> 1 V/sec). For the uranium case, this appears to be an oxidation step followed by a second-order disproportionation.

In a 7° vs. 12° plot, an average line through the points exhibited a negative slope at the lower Rs values and became horizontal at the larger values, in agreement with Fischer and Drackas' prediction. Because of the poor reproducibility, particularly at the longer transition times, the rate constant may only be stated as ~160 liters mole^1 sec^1 (at 500°C). Again, the effect of cylindrical diffusion was found to be negligible according to the criteria of Peters and Lingane. It is believed that the poor reproducibility is caused in part by the attack of UF, probably produced in the disproportionation reaction, on the electrode material.

In view of the catalytic nature of the U(IV) = U(IV) electrode reaction, this reaction is less useful analytically than the U(IV) > U(III) electrode reaction. It is also interesting to note that although the crystalline fluoride complexes of U(V) are stable at 350 to 400°C, an increase in temperature to 500°C, accompanied by a change to a liquid phase and a medium of relatively low free fluoride ion activity, results in the decomposition of U(V).

Work has continued on the development of a practical reference electrode for use in molten fluorides. In the course of this work, it became desirable to obtain additional quantitative data on the reversibility of the Ni(II) + 2e + Ni electrode reaction. It was decided to use one of the relaxation methods since a fast charge transfer was expected on the basis of available kinetic data in other molten-salt solvents. The voltage-step method of Vielstich and Delahay was selected primarily due to the simplicity of the instrumentation. The experimental procedure was similar to that of Laitinen, Tischer, and Roe who applied the method to the study of kinetic constants in.

The experimental setup for containing the melt was described previously. The circuit for the voltage step is essentially that of Laitinen, Tischer, and Roe. Two mercury relays (Clare HG 1003) were used to make sure that the short circuit between the electrodes was broken before applying the voltage step, usually 4 mV. The oscilloscope (Tektronix 549) used for recording the current-time curves is triggered by the signal.

Where I is the zero-time current, V is the known voltage step, and R is the total resistance of the system. The kinetic constants for the nickel-nickel(II) couple are shown in Table 14.3. Kinetic constants for metal-metal-ion systems in molten fluoride solvents are, for the most part, nonexistent. Therefore, comparisons are not possible, although it is believed that the reported values are of the correct order of magnitude. The exchange current is, in essence, a measure of the ability of a metal-metal-ion couple to pass current without becoming polarized. In view of the value obtained for nickel, and since high-impedance potential-measuring devices are normally used, it does not appear that the molar exchange current value for the Ni-Ni(II) couple imposes a restriction on its utilization as a reference electrode.

Well-defined voltammograms were obtained with pyrolytic graphite and glassy carbon indicator electrodes at a potential of about -0.9 V vs an Ni-NiF reference electrode. Linear plots of peak current (I_p) vs concentration were obtained over the concentration range studied, 0.008 to ~0.03 F Cr(II). Linear plots of I_p vs (scan rate)^1/2 obeyed the Randles-Sevcik equation from about 0.02 to 1 V/sec. The diffusion coefficient calculated from the slope of the line is of the order of 1 x 10^7 cm/sec at 500°C. In the presence of U(IV), the chromium wave is enhanced because the chromium reduction occurs at the foot of the U(IV) > UClD reduction wave.

In cooperation with T. R. Mueller of the Analytical Instrumentation Group, a first-derivative circuit was assembled for the controlled-potential, controlled-current cyclic voltammeter. The use of the derivative circuit resulted in much better resolution of the chromium waves in the presence of uranium; however, the derivative peak current for the Cr(II) = Cr(0) reduction was still enhanced by U(IV).

The facility can be used with solid, liquid, or gaseous samples at temperatures up to 800°C. As pointed out previously, the facility is designed primarily for use with molten fluoride salts and will be used to demonstrate the spectrophotometric.

Equipment has been designed, and techniques are being developed so that a sample of fuel can be taken from the MSRE reactor and divided into several (up to five) portions, and the portions can be transferred individually to a spectrophotometric furnace assembly for melting without any exposure to the atmosphere or to temperatures below 200°C for periods longer than 30 min. Exclusion of air is necessary to prevent the possible reaction of U(IV) with H2O and/or O2. An elevated temperature is required to prevent the radiolytic evolution of fluorine, which would alter the oxidation state of uranium on remelting the sample.

The apparatus required for this sample transfer has been designed with the assistance of F. L. Hannon and E. F. Marguerat (General Engineering Division, ORNL). It consists of six separate components: (1) sample ladle, which removes a 5-g molten-salt sample from the pump bowl of the reactor; (2) transport container, which receives the sample ladle and maintains it under inert gas; (3) heated transfer carrier, which receives the transport container, provides radiation shielding during transfer of the sample from reactor to hot cell, and heats the sample to ~200°C during the transfer; (4) sample-loading furnace, which receives the transport container in the hot cell. Within this assembly, the 5-g sample is melted and divided into as many as five containers for spectrophotometric study; (5) spectrophotometric furnace lid, which fits both the sample-loading and spectrophotometric furnaces. The lids receive the spectral sample for transfer between the two furnaces.

All of these sample-handling operations, of course, must be carried out with manipulators behind suitable shielding. The apparatus is designed in such a way that the manipulations required at the reactor site fall within their routine procedural requirements. At the hot cell, the apparatus can be operated, and general maintenance can be performed with master-slave manipulators. All of these components, except the sample-loading furnace, have been completely designed. Components 1, 2, 5, and 6 are presently being fabricated for testing prior to hot-cell use. The orientation of the apparatus within the hot cell is being evaluated so that all operations, sample handling, and maintenance can be carried out properly. The obvious applicability of this installation to other types of samples is also considered in this design.

It was found that Na, UF, at a temperature of 550°C undergoes a rapid and vigorous reaction, possibly with graphite, when it is in contact with molten LiF-BeF2 contained in a graphite windowless spectrophotometric cell. A gas is evolved in the process, and a clear and visually colorless solution results. The spectrum of this solution has been identified as that of U(V). Over the wavelength range of 250 to 2000 nm, this spectrum of U(V) consists of two overlapping peaks centered (molar absorptivities are approximately 6, 3, and 15, respectively).

Not stable and slowly converted to U(IV). The molar absorptivities given above were calculated from the measurement of the decrease of absorbance of U(V) and the corresponding increase of U(IV), and the known absorptivities of U(IV). The assumption was made that the only two uranium species of any significant concentration in the melt at any time were U(IV) and U(V). By means of the sharp absorption peak at 1465 nm, it should be possible to detect U(V) in MSR fuels at levels of approximately 10% of the U(IV) concentration.

The loss of U(V) concentration appeared to follow second-order kinetics in which the initial concentrations of the reacting species are equal. This would suggest that the U(V) was lost by disproportionation. At 550°C, the rate constant was calculated to be approximately 0.005 liter mole/sec. Second-order rate constants for the disproportionation of U(V) at an electrode are orders of magnitude larger.

Spectrally. Although LaF has a slight solubility in the solvent, this container material should not be oxidized by U(VI), and indeed, no observable reaction was seen in this melt, unlike the case in graphite. Intense absorption in the ultraviolet region was observed, with shoulders in the region of 315 and 270 nm. Some U(IV) and U(V) were observed, and apparently were produced by reaction of U(V) with impurities in the melt. The addition of chromium metal to the melt caused the disappearance of the ultraviolet absorption and produced the partially interfering spectrum of U(V) and U(VI). It is assumed that the initial spectrum observed is that of a very low concentration of U(V) of the form UFO77. The absorbing species is not UO, which has been observed in other studies. It is also interesting to note that no spectral evidence for UO is observed when UO2 is reduced by Fe; only U(IV) is produced.

The spectra of several 3d transition metal ions, these ions were dissolved in several molten fluoride salts, which are essentially the stoichiometric mixture Li, BeF, with and without excess F as LiF. The spectra were obtained in the temperature range 540 to 650°C. The samples were contained in graphite, windowless containers for the study. Iron(II) exhibits a peak and shoulder absorbance envelope with maximum absorbance at 9800 and 5500 cm-1. The spectrum appears unaffected by a change in solvent composition. The spectrum of Ni(II) at a temperature of 550°C consists of three peaks at 23,100. Cr(III) exhibits three peaks, and molar absorptivities are ca. 10, 10, and 7. The spectral results would suggest that, in general, these ions are situated in O symmetry in these melts with little tendency to change if the free fluoride ion concentration is reduced over the range studied. Iron(II) is a possible exception to.

The study of the electrochemical generation and spectral identification of solute species in molten fluoride salts has continued. It has been apparent that melt impurities, primarily hydrolysis products, must be absent for the generation of the desired solute species.

Pretreatment at 450°C. Of these methods, the vacuum pretreatment proved to be the most effective. It was noted that the removal of HF from molten LiF-NaF-KF was best achieved by evacuating the melt at 860°C, whereas SiF4 was removed at 500°C. Silicon tetrafluoride is highly soluble in molten LiF-NaF-KF, and its dissolution is an endothermic process. An increase in pressure and changes in the forms of the voltammograms of the melt indicated that the HF and SiF4 had been removed at the temperatures cited.

The reduction of Ta(V) in molten LiF-NaF-KF at a platinum electrode appears to be at least a two-step process to the metal, as was reported by Senderoff et al. Attempts to verify the reported oxidation of Ta(V) to Ta(VI) have yielded inconclusive results. The anodic dissolution of a copper electrode in molten LiF-NaF-KF produces at least two oxidation states of copper. An insoluble form of Cu(I) was produced at +1.1 V vs. the platinum quasi-reference electrode, and at +1.

A helium breakdown voltage detector is being studied for use in a gas chromatograph for the determination of permanent gas impurities in the helium blanket gas of the MSRE. The breakdown voltage of pure helium was of the order of 500 V and was decreased by approximately 50 V by a 1-ppm concentration of impurities. The minimum detectable limit of impurities is controlled primarily by the helium purity and the noise level in the detector. A minimum noise level was obtained with a smooth glow discharge on the anode probe. This condition was affected by the current level, amount of contaminants, and the spacing and alignment of the electrodes.

The addition of mercury vapor by the presence of a small source of the metal in the tip of the anode stabilized the discharge, but temperatures above 50°C gave high concentrations of mercury, which greatly decreased the sensitivity of the detector. A method of adding a smaller amount of mercury vapor by passing a controlled flow of helium through a heated tube containing HgO and a catalyst (Fe2O3) was not completely successful due to the gradual increase in temperature required to maintain a constant evolution rate.

A more practical solution is adding a contaminant into the detector through the anode probe. When a 1000-ppm H2-in-He gas mixture was used, it was difficult to maintain a constant low pressure on the capillary for a constant low flow rate. The use of a 100-ppm H2-in-He gas mixture allowed the use of higher pressures, which gave more constant flow rates and less fluctuation in the helium breakdown voltage. The hydrogen was not as effective as mercury in stabilizing the discharge, but some other gas may give an optimum effect. A 50-ppm Xe-in-He gas mixture was tested, and xenon was found to be ~10 times as effective as H2.

A system for continuously measuring the total hydrocarbon concentration in the radioactive offgas of the MSRE has been installed in the gas sampling station. In this system, the reactor off-gas is passed through a combustion tube that contains CuO maintained at 700°C. This combustion converts hydrocarbons in the helium to CO and H2O. The oxidized gas stream is passed through one side of a thermal-conductivity (TC) cell, through a 3A molecular sieve—Ascarite—Mg(ClO4)2 trap, which removes the CO and H2O, and back through the reference side of the TC cell. A length of brass tubing is installed upstream to the reference side of the TC cell. After the gas stream is switched by means of valves to bypass the trap, a step response in the TC signal is obtained. This plateau represents the period required to equilibrate the oxidized surface of the brass tubing with moisture. By use of standard gas mixtures, it was demonstrated in a laboratory system that the relative step heights are proportional (within +10%) to the ratio of CO to H2O.

The initial tests of the system on MSRE off-gas have shown that the fission-product activity in this stream causes serious interference. This interference is largely the result of the radiolysis of traces of absorbed water in the trap rather than.

Tests have been made on the materials contained in the trap to determine the effect of radiation. Samples (5 g) were sealed in 20-cc glass vials filled with helium at 50 mm pressure and were subjected to 2 x 10^7 rads of Co-60 radiation. Mass spectrometry showed that hydrogen is the major radiolysis product from Ascarite, while oxygen was produced from both wet and dry samples of Mg(ClO4)2. Wet molecular sieve gave some H2, N2, CO, and O2. Dry molecular sieve produced very little contaminant gas on irradiation. The large trap that contained the combination of absorbing materials is being replaced with a small trap that contains only molecular sieve. A heater on this trap will keep it free of water and CO2 by a bakeout between tests. The amount of contaminant gases produced by radiolysis in this small dry trap should be greatly decreased.

Products that deposit on components (principally the heat exchanger) of the MSRE. A knowledge of the deposited fission products is important primarily for estimation of the heat generated by the fission products after reactor shutdown and for purposes of remote maintenance. In addition, there is a specific interest in determining if 95Zr deposits.

Measurements of the fission products were made by gamma spectrometry using a highly collimated Ge(Li) diode. The collimator consisted of a lead cylinder with a diameter of 19 inches and a length of 33. 5 inches. By means of the collimator, the detector could be focused on an area about 3 inches in diameter on the reactor components (a source-to-detector distance of 15 feet). Pulse-height spectra were taken with a 400-channel analyzer. Measurements were begun on March 28, 1968 (five days after reactor shutdown) and continued at intervals.

The major fission products found in the heat exchanger and input and output fuel salt lines of the heat exchanger were 19Te, 137I, 103Ru, 99Mo, and 95Nb. Minor amounts of 100Ru and 140Ba were found. Fission products detected in the pump bowl and off-gas line included those listed above and 141Ce, 131I, and 137Cs. No 95Zr was detected. Quantitative results were obtained in terms of curies per square inch of area contacted by the fuel salt. Table 14.4 lists the mean deposition values found in the heat exchanger for the fission products 95Nb, 100Mo, 103Ru, and 132Te, 132I. Table 14.4 also lists the percent of total inventory for each fission product.

Assistance is being given to the Reactor Chemistry Division in a study of in-pile penetration of fission products into MSRE and pyrolytic graphite. Cylindrical specimens were obtained from blocks of graphite (removed from the reactor in the spring of 1967 and March 1968) by core drilling. These specimens were repeatedly sanded to obtain samples (on emery paper) as a function of depth in the graphite. The thickness of graphite represented by the samples was varied from about 0.001 in. near the surface of the specimen to about. The first series of samples were measured by NaI(Tl) spectrometry.

Several innovations in the technique resulted in the improvement of the precision by a factor of 2. A more reproducible decay time was obtained by increasing the pressure of the air propelling the "rabbit" from 10 psi to 20 psi. The irradiation time was increased from 60 to 120 sec, and the decay time from 20 to 25 sec. Under these new conditions, the total count is a little less dependent on variations in the decay time. The relative standard deviation on samples was improved from 0. 5 to 0.

The electronic resolution of this system is still the one single problem in improving the accuracy of this method. A new current-sensitive preamplifier has been developed by the Instrumentation and Controls Division, which holds good promise of improving the time resolution of this.

The instrument is capable of taking 20 polarograms of a single solution in 25 min with a relative standard deviation of 0. 1%. Uranium peak heights of the derivative polarograms are measured as voltage on a digital voltmeter, as it is virtually impossible to measure a polarogram traced on a recorder chart with this precision. 1%; however, a negative bias of approximately 0. 5% has been observed. The use of the standard addition technique together with a maximum suppressor (Triton X) has not eliminated this negative bias. W. L. Maddox recently found that a 60-cycle AC signal is present in the electrode system. This could account for the difficulty in obtaining accurate results. The study will be resumed when this AC pickup has been eliminated.

A unique method is under development to increase the precision of the remote determination of uranium in the MSRE fuel. The current method, which consists of a direct measurement of uranium in a sulfuric acid solution of the fuel by controlled-potential coulometry, has a precision of about 1%. It will be difficult to maintain this precision when the concentration of uranium is reduced to 0.13 mole % for 23°U operations. For optimum control of the reactor by chemical analysis, the precision should be approximately 0. 1%.

The method under investigation is based on the preliminary separation of the uranium from the balance of the fuel by fluorination at 600°C and collection of the UF6 on a trap of NaF. The UF6 and NaF are dissolved in a sulfuric acid–boric acid mixture, and the uranium, now free from interfering ions, is determined with a high-sensitivity controlled-potential coulometric titrator. Preliminary tests have shown that >99% of the uranium can be volatilized from a 50-g fuel sample in a 1-hr fluorination period. The coulometric titration technique has been used in the laboratory to determine uranium in solutions with precision.

A precision of better than 0. 5% would be quite difficult if it were necessary to pipette and titrate an aliquot of the sample remotely within the hot cell. Whether or not the trap, which contains the separated UF, can be removed from the hot cell for a more precise uranium determination depends on the amount of radioactivity (e. g. , ruthenium, niobium, tellurium, iodine, etc. ) carried over to the trap. To reduce the high level of activity, a pre-trap containing NaF and heated to 400°C was positioned between the fluorination reactor and the collection trap. The UF is not retained in the pre-trap at this higher temperature.

A fluorination apparatus was constructed and placed in a hot cell. The design is such that all manipulations may be made with little or no difficulty within the cell. All gas-flow and temperature-adjustment controls are mounted outside and at the front of the cell. Several runs were made with simulated MSRE fuel before fluorination of an actual MSRE sample was attempted.

Initial recoveries were low due to an apparent loss of the high-density UF6 between the inner wall of the fluorination pot and the liner which contains the sample. The apparatus was modified by the reduction in diameter of the pot and the addition of an inert-gas flush line with an inlet at the bottom of the pot. Since recoveries were now better than 97%, a series of MSRE samples were fluorinated in order to recover and purify the uranium for isotopic examination. Although the original samples read between 500 and 600 rems, the collection traps seldom exceeded 20 millirems after fluorination and were removed safely from the hot cell for the uranium analysis.

In order to further increase the accuracy and precision of the method, provision was made to flush fluorine also through the inlet at the bottom of the pot. Several hot MSRE samples have since been analyzed. Results are encouraging in that the uranium values for these samples agree within 0. 2% with values for similar samples which were analyzed remotely. The precision of the analysis of replicates of the fluorinated samples is better than 0. 2%. Known amounts of uranium will be added to barren salt samples to further evaluate.

Budgetary limitations have necessitated the suspension of the ORR convection loop program during fiscal year 1969. As such, no further development of the third loop has occurred. However, some peripheral investigations have been carried out during this period.

Investigations of the wetting of graphite by salt, prompted by the observation that salt had wetted the graphite in the second ORR loop, were continued. The results suggest that this wetting occurred during the multiple sample-withdrawal drain operation, since wetting was shown to be promoted at points of three-phase contact of salt, graphite, and gas at substantially lower moisture levels than was the case for the ORR loop, and wetting does not occur when the graphite is totally immersed.

Coolant salt in spent HFIR fuel elements was evaluated. No stability or compatibility problems were observed after 1460 hr exposure under conditions of temperature and gamma radiation intensity approximating those in an MSBR heat exchanger. Considerations of the effects of delayed-neutron fluences indicate that consequent fluorine generation will be tolerably low.

A removable section of the MSRE off-gas line, located 2 ft downstream from the pump bowl, was examined as part of the continuing effort to establish the fates of fission products in molten-salt reactors. The results confirmed other studies that have shown unexpectedly large amounts of noble metals in the off-gas, but they did not reveal any macro deposits of such isotopes.

The susceptibility of molten salts to traces of moisture in the cover gas was studied by Kreyger, Kirslis, and Blankenship, who associated wetting of graphite by salt with three-phase contact of gas, graphite, and salt at moisture levels in the gas as low as 10 ppm or lower. We observed wetting of.

Fuel channel surfaces in graphite were examined for salt interaction in the second molten-salt in-pile loop. The salt was drained from the loop using pressurization with high-purity argon (<4 ppm H2O). Additionally, droplets of salt were observed to have melted on the graphite.

Similar problems due to low levels of moisture or other contaminants in gas could arise in molten-salt reactors, in reprocessing experiments, and in other situations involving molten salts containing lithium and beryllium fluorides. The studies reported below have been conducted in an effort to find experimental operating conditions and procedures in which the interaction of salt with trace moisture in the cover gas does not occur, and wetting does not ensue.

We tested the tendency of graphite to be wetted if entirely immersed in salt. Two squares of graphite were connected in a T arrangement and fixed in an inverted position in a clean copper dish. The dish was filled with Li, BeF, salt, which was melted under vacuum in a glove box so that the horizontal piece of graphite was covered with molten salt without exposure to gas. Helium was then admitted, and the system maintained molten. After one day, the copper was wet by salt, and after one more day, salt began to creep up the exposed part of the vertical graphite piece. The salt crept outside the cup. The graphite pieces were lifted from the salt, and the salt was frozen. Microscopic examination of the graphite showed that all areas in contact with gas had been wet and covered with a film of salt, but no evidence of wetting was found on any region of the immersed graphite.

Similar behavior was apparent in droplet experiments reported below. When a droplet, for various reasons, moved away from its original location, it was observed that the graphite surface initially coveted by the molten salt was not wetted. Only subsequently would the salt interface creep over.

These experiments indicate that in molten-salt reactors, graphite should not be wetted by salt while it is immersed, but is very susceptible to wetting during draining and filling operations. The observed importance of the three-phase contact area suggests that moisture-promoted wetting is lateral only and should not proceed inward from a graphite surface, since salt which has covered the surface will prevent moisture-containing gas from getting to a deeper contact area and furthering the penetration. It seems likely that wetting of the graphite in the ORR loop occurred during the multiple sample-withdrawal drain operation in which tank argon (~4 ppm H2O) was used to move the salt in the equipment at intervals.

A qualitative indication of the rate of moisture absorption by salt from such gas was provided by an experiment. Helium containing approximately 4 ppm H2O was passed through three bubblers in series, each containing 30 g of molten Li2BeF4 salt. The flow was maintained for ten days at about 100 cc/min, which was adequate to raise the oxygen content of one bubbler by 140 ppm if all the moisture were absorbed in it.

The oxygen contents of the salt from the respective bubblers were found to be in the range of 60 to 65 ppm (original salt was 42 ppm), indicating that about 15% of the inlet oxygen was taken up in each bubbler. Simple nonconvective diffusion to a rapidly absorbing wall should almost completely deplete the moisture in any bubble of reasonable size (approximately 7 cm/sec). Consequently, the wall did not absorb rapidly, and the reaction rate is indicated to have been limited by liquid film or surface reaction rate factors rather than by gas film.

The incomplete but definite nature of moisture removal in this experiment was substantiated by observed wetting times of molten-salt droplets on graphite planchets in heated quartz tubes. Immediately before and after the bubblers upstream, wetting time was 7 hours, while in the downstream tube wetting occurred overnight.

Conventional techniques were tested first using a vacuum glove box: heated traps filled with sponge titanium, preconditioned molecular sieves at room temperature, and liquid nitrogen traps containing molecular sieves or activated charcoal were used to further treat high-purity helium to develop a glove-box atmosphere in which wetting did not occur. These techniques, including long-term flushing and recirculation, did not inhibit the wetting, probably because gloves, large metal surfaces, and other factors provide a countervailing source of moisture. This was exemplified by an experiment in which a copper dish containing 50 g of Li,BeF, was heated in the box while helium was recirculated through a molecular sieve trap and a trap containing heated titanium sponge. A moisture meter in the circuit showed 4 ppm H2O. However, in 24 hr, salt had crept out of the dish sufficiently to short the furnace leads below.

To contain 376 ppm oxygen (original salt, 42 ppm), an order of magnitude more water is being absorbed than indicated by the moisture meter to be in the gas. This indicates an appreciable source of moisture in the box, reacting rapidly enough to compete successfully with the 3-hr recirculation turnover.

We installed a second heated quartz tube containing titanium sponge upstream of the first in an effort to establish nonwetting conditions under flow. After melting under vacuum, flow was started, and the salt rapidly became covered with a milky film. The experiment was repeated with new materials, and a film developed on the salt within 20 hours. This suggested that system surfaces in between could be contributing moisture.

Quartz tube containing the molten salt droplet between the gas inlet and the graphite planchet. After melting the salt, helium flow was started at 10 cc/min. The salt remained in unimpaired condition for a week. Flow was increased to 500 cc/min; then lowered to 100 cc/min, and the upstream trap cooled. The salt remained clear and non-wetting for a day.

Thus, it was demonstrated that wetting of graphite by salt can be prevented by stringent treatment of the cover gas. The precautions and length of pretreatment periods required to develop non-wetting conditions indicate that even the low levels of moisture that can be desorbed from tubing walls are sufficient to promote wetting.

In the above experiment, flow was continued after cooling the titanium sponge. After two days of flow, during which time enough moisture entered to cover the estimated titanium surface only a few times, wetting of the graphite by the droplet was observed. This confirmed that the protective action was associated with heated titanium sponge and also indicated that the activity of cold titanium sponge was probably limited because the active surface was not renewed and became saturated.

The proposed use in molten-salt breeder reactors of coolant salt mixtures based on fluoroborates could be questioned if significant decomposition of the salt occurred as a result of exposure to delayed neutrons and gamma radiation from the fuel salt circulated through the heat exchanger. Neutrons would cause a 10B(n,c) reaction, yielding from NaBF4 an alpha particle, 7LiF, NaF, and F (or excess free F atoms). The high-energy alpha and 7Li fragments (2. 4+ MeV) could decompose other fluoroborate ions, presumably yielding in such a case elemental boron and fluorine and fluoride ions. Intense gamma radiation could have a similar effect. The (n,) reaction is calculable and appears to be trivial. The high-energy fragment decomposition of molten fluoroborate is not known explicitly, nor is the gamma effect. Since these would be expected to have similar results, the gamma effect has been evaluated first in order to permit discrimination if required.

An experimental rig to expose molten fluoroborate salt to intense gamma radiation was described previously. An argon-filled aluminum container with a heated capsule containing the salt was placed in the center hole of a freshly spent fuel element from the High Flux Isotope Reactor in the reactor.

The first fluoroborate irradiation assembly, reported earlier, was exposed at 600°C for 533 hours, accumulating a dose of 2 x 10^10 r. The temperature profile in the capsule appeared to have been uneven, attributed to some water collected in the containment.

The gamma dose rate to these experiments fell as the element decayed, in accord with estimates based on the Way-Wigner or Untermyer-Weills equations. The HFIR elements were generally run at 100 MW for 23 days. We inserted our experimental assembly into the center hole of the spent element after a cooling period after shutdown of from about 1 to 4 days, removing it only to insert it into the next freshly spent element.

The gamma flux was determined by the reduction of 0. 02 M Ce(SO4)2 solutions exposed in the center hole before and after the exposure of the experimental rig and was determined during exposure by observing the added electrical heat (per unit of heated system mass) required to maintain a constant temperature (to be compared with the requirement in the absence of gamma radiation). Results are shown in Fig. 1, where electric heat requirement is plotted against a time scale based on decay heat as a fraction of operation power computed using the Way-Wigner equation. Electric heat requirement was extrapolated to zero decay heat, and gamma heat was measured from this as the origin. Using the definition that 100 ergs/g = 1 rad, the dose rate was calculated. Thus, the radiation intensity varied between 140 x 100 r/hr (0. 4 w/g) for an element cooled 1. 5 days to 17 x. Values obtained by ceric sulfate dosimetry, also shown, scattered more but were in agreement.

Prior to exposure, the 32 g of NaBF4-NaF eutectic mixture (92-8 mole %) was melted in the Hastelloy N capsule under argon, and the capsule was sealed under argon. The capsule was then vacuum-pumped at 150°C, valved off under vacuum, and heated to 600°C. The observed pressure of ~142 mm Hg is as anticipated from Cantor's data. Upon cooling.

During irradiation, which was uneventful except for a plugging problem discussed below, an argon atmosphere was maintained in the container around the capsule. In contrast to the first experiment, no evidence of water in the container was found.

To 600°C following a short power interruption to the capsule heater. The tube was opened by heating the capsule slowly to ~650°C (F, pressure, ~% atm). The capillary tube remained open until it plugged a second time after 26 days of operation. This plug occurred when the salt temperature was decreased from 600°C to 370°C when power to the electric heater was interrupted.

Near the end of the irradiation period, argon gas (300 mm Hg pressure) was added to the pressure tube in an attempt to relieve the plug so that the residual gas in the capsule could be removed for analysis. When the capsule assembly (with pressure tube and transducer intact) was removed from the fuel element and transferred to Y-12, the pressure had decreased from 300 mm to 105 mm, indicating some leakage of argon into the capsule past the plug in the tube. Mass spectrographic analysis of the gas (argon plus residual) removed.

The droplets found in the gas regions are attributed to spray developing as the system boiled under vacuum during heat-up. We heated the salt similarly in a quartz tube and observed boiling and spray. The increasing gas pressure is believed to have forced some droplets into the capillary, ultimately resulting in the observed plugging.

None of the findings were indicative of any radiation decomposition of fluoroborate. It is consequently concluded that no incompatibility between the fluoroborate salt and Hastelloy N was caused by gamma irradiation to a dose of 7.7 x 10^10 r with an average intensity of 0. 15 W/g and a maximum intensity of 0.5 W/g. For comparison, the average intensity of absorbed gamma radiation estimated for the MSBR heat exchangers is ~0. 25 W/g, and for the MSRE, it is ~0. 02 W/g.

An open and documented literature search revealed no studies of radiation or neutron effects on fluoroborate salts. A study on BF4 (gas) appears relevant. MTR exposure of four capsules containing BF4 to various integrated thermal neutron fluences up to 8 x 10^79 nvt resulted in decomposition of up to about 50% of the BF4, with about twice as many molecules of BF4 being decomposed as there were helium atoms produced.

This amounted to about 24 molecules of F being produced per boron fission (2. 4+ MeV), or about 14 molecules of F by the fission-fragment action. The resulting apparent G value is 0. 6 x 10-4 molecules of F per 100 eV for the high-energy alpha and Li particles. The low value is indicative of vigorous recombination of any BF3 fragments.

To be demonstrated, a useful means of removal and recovery of some of these substances could be developed. In any event, the understanding of fission product behavior in molten-salt systems would be increased. Examination of material deposited in the off-gas system would be the most direct approach.

After the shutdown of MSRE run 14 on March 25, 1968, a section of off-gas line, the jumper section of line 522, was removed for examination. This line, a 3-ft length of 4-in. -ID open convolution flexible hose fabricated of type 304 stainless steel with O-ringed flanges on each end, is located about 2 ft downstream from the pump bowl. The upstream flange is a side-entering flange which attaches to the vertical line leaving the pump bowl, while the downstream flange is a top-entering flange which attaches to the widened holdup line. The jumper discussed here, the third used in the MSRE, was installed prior to run 10, which began in December 1966.

Being retained by the building charcoal trap, the jumper section was removed from the container and placed on fresh blotter paper. Some dust fell from the upstream flange. This dust was recovered, and a possibly larger amount was obtained from the flange face using a camel's hair brush. The powder looked like soot when it fell but drifted somewhat in the moving air of the cell, as if it were a heavy dust. An ~8-mg sample read about 80 r/hr at contact. The downstream flange was tapped and brushed over a sheet of paper, and similar quantities of black powder were obtained from it. Chemical and radiochemical analyses of these dust samples are given later.

The flanges each appeared to have remaining on them a smooth, dull-black film but no other deposits of significance. Some unidentified bright flecks were seen in or on the surface of the upstream flange. Where the black film was gently scratched, bright metal showed through.

Short sections of the jumper-line hose were taken from each end, examined microscopically, and submitted for chemical and radiochemical analysis. Except for rather thin, dull-black films which smoothly covered all surfaces, including the convolutions, no deposits, attack, or other effects.

Other portions of the upstream and downstream powders were analyzed chemically for carbon and spectrographically for lithium, beryllium, zirconium, and other metals. In addition, 75U was determined by neutron activation analysis. This could be converted to total uranium by using the enrichment of the uranium in the MSRE fuel salt, which was about.

Analyses of the dust samples show 12 to 16% carbon, 28 to 54% fuel salt, and 4% structural metals. Based on activity data considered later, fission products could have amounted to 2 to 3% of the sample weight. Thereby, 53 to 22% of the sample weight is not accounted for in these categories or spectrographically as other metals. The discrepancies may have resulted from the small amounts of sample available. The sample did not lose weight under a heat lamp and thus did not contain readily volatile substances.

1297 and 1311 (The daughter). These analyses were obtained on samples of dust from upstream and downstream flanges, on the ~1-inch sections of flexible hose cut near the flanges, and on the first flexible shaft tool used to probe the pump off-gas exit line.

Amounts such as MSRE inventory. Direct comparison between samples of different types requires the establishment of a relationship between the types, which has not been done; however, relative comparisons might be made. The MSRE inventory decay rate of each isotope (referred to as run 14 shutdown) was computed from the detailed power history of the reactor (8. 0 MW full power) by summation.

Of power-weighted saturation factors for each period. Inventory decay rates were also calculated for daughters of rare gases based on the amount of the short-lived rare gas that could be stripped from the circulating fuel salt into the pump bowl gas space.

Rare gas, which enters the pump bowl either dissolved in salt or in entrained bubbles, is entirely stripped into the purge gas stream, and effectively none of it is returned to the main circulating stream in any re-entrained bubbles. More complex assumptions regarding mass transfer characteristics to bubbles and their entrainment and stripping are not attempted here.

On such an inventory basis, the salt constituents can also be included in the comparison, as can carbon if a lubricating oil leak rate (such as a reported value of 1. 58 liters in 5 months) is assumed to persist for the full period of operation. These data are thus presented in terms of MSRE inventory in Table 17. 2. Similar behavior of the various kinds of constituents should yield equal values for all data for a given kind of sample. Table 17. 2 is discussed below from this point of view.

Proportions of Li, Be, and U agreed within each sample within a factor of 2, with Li always high. Zirconium varied between agreement and values of about % of the others. Thus, to a fair approximation, the fuel ingredients appear to have been transported as particles, presumably droplets of a spray. Uranium does not appear in any sample to have been carried over by any mechanism more than other constituents. For the flexible tool, the relatively higher values of lithium and beryllium may indicate pickup of some residual LiF, BeF, flush salt, which had entered this line as overflow in 1966, just prior to the installation of the present jumper.

Deposition of soot over all areas is not surprising. With a mean residence time of 6 min in a gas space at 600 to 700°C, with beta decay energy of the order of 100 W/liter, substantial pyrolysis-radiolysis of lubricating oil leaking into the pump bowl should result in tars and coked soot. Some soot appeared.

Not greatly below the relative yields of the daughters of the rare gas fission products. This is compatible with the hypothesis of aerosols of these elements, and with a portion of these elements depositing on internal surfaces. Tellurium and iodine, regarded as a tellurium daughter, could be included in this.

The relative amount of 95Nb in dust samples appears to be significantly higher than that of salt and higher than its parent 95Zr. However, it is considerably lower than the levels for noble metals. Niobium may be transferred by a different mechanism.

Our irradiation testing in the HFIR is an integral part of this program. It is quite likely that we shall need graphite with a low surface diffusivity for fission products, particularly 155Xe. The target diffusivity of less than 10 cm/sec is best obtained.

The primary fault with the type of Hastelloy N used in the MSRE is that its strength and ductility are reduced by irradiation. We have demonstrated that a slight modification of the chemical composition improves the resistance of this alloy to neutron damage. We are working on the scale-up of this alloy and are confronted with some problems that are not at all foreign to nickel-base alloys. Two such problems, a high-temperature metallurgical instability, and poor weldability, are under study.

Our corrosion program is concerned primarily with the compatibility of Hastelloy N with the proposed fluoroborate coolant salt.

Cores were removed, and two new stringers were inserted. Also, one stringer of the vessel surveillance specimens consisting of two Hastelloy N tensile specimen rods from ~5 in. outside the core vessel was removed, and a new stringer was inserted. 1.

The core surveillance specimens were received at the Hot-Cell facilities on April 3, 1968. The salt had drained cleanly from the container basket and specimens, and the assembly of metal and graphite specimens appeared to be in excellent physical condition. Disassembly and reassembly of this complex rig of three stringers of graphite and Hastelloy N were routine.

107° neutrons/cm (>50 keV), respectively (see Table 18. 1). They included several special types of graphite in addition to the MSRE-grade CGB graphite to obtain more detailed information on the behavior of the fission products. These were pitch-impregnated grade CGB, pyrolytic graphite, and isotropic graphite, grade AXF-5QBG. The results of the fission product studies on these materials are given in Part 3 of this report.

Graphite specimens appeared unaltered in diffused lighting; however, under special high-angle lighting, there was a very thin film of material visible that was more clearly seen on the graphite having the longest exposure. The appearance of this film on the graphite in stringer RR2 is shown in Fig. 18. 2; it is nearly invisible on stringer RS3. The films were on the surfaces of the graphite that were exposed to the laminarly flowing fuel salt along the full vertical length of the surveillance specimen's assembly. Where pieces of graphite were in intimate contact and the flow of salt was restricted, films were not visible. Note in Fig.

Two new stringers, RS4 and RR3, of graphite and modified Hastelloy N for the core, and one modified Hastelloy stringer (two rods of tensile specimens), X3, replaced those removed (see Table 18. 1). The graphite specimens continued to be predominantly grade CGB for the continued monitoring and study of the MSRE core graphite.

A new feature of the two new core stringers is the placement of a 0.004-inch-thick foil of Hastelloy N at some of the strap positions, as shown in Fig. 3. This type of specimen was requested by the Reactor Chemistry Division to allow the use of more convenient and accurate techniques for determining the fission product deposition on the Hastelloy N.

Figure 18. 4 shows some fabrication modifications that have been made to allow flowing salt on all four sides of the graphite rather than on only three. A comparison of the fission products deposited on different sides of these samples should give qualitative information on how flow rate affects fission product deposition. Our graphite specimens are routinely machined with surface finishes of less than 32 μin. We have included some identical graphite samples with the 32-μin. surface and with polished surfaces (Fig. 18. 4). The polished surfaces may enable a better delineation of the fission product distribution since, in most cases, 90 to 95% of each nuclide was found in the first 10 mils from the graphite surfaces.

Solid Graphite Specimens for the Controls and Test Surveillance Specimens: (a) Top and Bottom Controls; (b) Middle Control; (c) Middle Test; (d) Top and Bottom Controls. Specimens shown in (b) and (c) have notches machined in them to allow flowing salt on all four sides. The top surface of the specimen in (c) has been polished to produce a more accurate reference for fission product sampling.

We have reported previously the properties of two groups of Hastelloy N surveillance samples removed from the MSRE. The properties of the third group of specimens, removed on April 3, 1968, give further information on the behavior of Hastelloy N after long periods of exposure to a neutron flux, salt, and N2 plus 2 to 5% O2 environments. Rods of standard Hastelloy N were removed from the core, and the vessel surveillance rods positioned outside the vessel closely reflect.

The properties of the vessel after 72,441 MWh of operation. The only Hastelloy N parts that have had an exposure comparable with that of the rods removed from the core (thermal fluence = 9.4 x 10^20 neutrons/cm) are the control rod thimbles, which are under a slightly compressive stress and can be replaced relatively easily. The vessel would only reach a thermal-neutron exposure of this magnitude after 40 years of operation, so the results on these specimens are of interest primarily for future reactors.

The excellent compatibility of Hastelloy N with respect to the surface modification resulting from exposure to salt for 15,300 hours is less than 0.001 inches deep and is quite similar to that noted in specimens removed after 4800 hours of exposure. The samples exposed to the cell environment (0.6) were oxidized to a depth of about 0.001 inches, and the microstructure was modified to a total depth of about 0.002 inches. The profuse quantities of grain-boundary carbide precipitates were formed.

As a result of the long nuclear and thermal exposures and having no relation to the environment, we ran a wide spectrum of tests on these materials but shall present only the results of particular concern to the MSRE. We have shown that this alloy is subject to a type of high-temperature radiation damage which reduces the creep-rupture strength and the strain at fracture. This is due to the helium produced by the thermal 10B(m, a) transmutation. A second potential problem that has been pointed out by our surveillance program is that the fracture strain at ambient temperature (25°C) continues to decrease with exposure. Thus, our program is directed strongly at measuring the changes in the properties of our Hastelloy N surveillance specimens at 25. The tests that have been shown in 7. Generally, a thermal fluence of 1.3 x 10° neutrons/cm, and about 85% is transmuted at 9.4 x 102° neutrons/cm. The variation in rupture life due to different fluences is greater, the higher the stress level.

The strain at fracture measured in both creep-rupture and tensile tests at 650°C is shown in Fig. 8. The scatter band is for the same heats of material irradiated in the ORR. The fracture strain at high strain rates (e. g. , 12 and 300%/hr) is very dependent on the thermal fluence, but most creep specimens with a thermal fluence of £13 10° neutrons/cm fractured at 1 to 2.5% strain, regardless of strain rate. The surveillance samples seem to be immune to the ductility minimum as a function of fracture strain established for the same materials when irradiated for shorter times (~1000 hr) in the ORR. The samples irradiated to 9.4 x 1020 neutrons/cm exhibit extremely low fracture strains under creep conditions.

That the magnitude of the ductility reduction is dependent upon time and fluence. It is not clear whether thermal or fast fluence is the most important since both change simultaneously. Our metallographic observations of carbide precipitates.

Ductility can be restored by a post-irradiation anneal of 8 hr at 871°C (Table 18. 3). Indicate that the reduction in fracture strain is likely due to carbide precipitation. This precipitation is controlled largely by thermal annealing (indicated by the control samples in Table 18. 3), and the neutron irradiation enhances the process. To date, the lowest fracture strain observed is 28. 9%, a very acceptable value for operation. Two heats of modified Hastelloy N were removed.

That looks more like a deposit than a corrosive attack. This portion of the sample may have been in contact with graphite, and the coating may be a carbide layer. Moderate grain-boundary precipitation has occurred in the alloy. The post-irradiation properties of these materials are better than those of standard Hastelloy N. The improvement is illustrated by the creep-rupture results. The rupture life is improved markedly, but the most significant improvement is in the fracture strain. We are continuing the development of these alloy systems.

We have continued the procurement of special grades of graphite for MSBRs for (1) the determination of the physical and mechanical properties before and after irradiation; (2) sealing research with pyrolytic carbon; (3) graphite-to-metal joining studies; and (4) fabrication of test assemblies.

For use in building engineering experiments, several pipes of the H337 graphite are shown in Figure 1. There are no detectable cracks in this material, and the physical and mechanical properties look reasonably attractive. Grade JOZ is the base stock for grades H337 and H364. The latter was laboratory processed and should be essentially the same as grade H337. Grade H364 has shown relatively good stability under the preliminary behavior of JOZ, and H337 should give some indication of the effects of heavy impregnation on the stabilities of graphite under irradiation.

Development Department of the Y-12 Plant. The general status and goals of the program to date are summarized in Table 19. 2. The anisotropic materials are used primarily for comparison with data obtained in other irradiation facilities. The terms mechanical, mechanical-chemical, and chemical refer to the techniques used to obtain isotropic bodies. The mechanical technique obtains isotropy by randomizing the orientation of anisotropic or near-isotropic filler materials.

And sized to make isotropic filler material, which is blended with a suitable binder and fabricated with standard processes. Isotropic grades AXF and 2033 have been fabricated this way. The preliminary data indicate that the extruded bodies have properties equal to those of the special starting materials.

We run a set of very cursory property tests on new graphites to determine whether they are potentially useful for use in MSBRs or whether they can contribute to our understanding of irradiation damage in graphite. Those that are of interest are tested more thoroughly. Our basic requirements are that the material be isotropic, that it has a density >1.85 g/cc, that the maximum pore entrance diameter be <1 μ, and that the helium gas permeability be <10 cm/sec.

Design and build a wide-range gas permeability apparatus to measure permeabilities from 10^-1 to as low as <10^-12 cm/sec. The measurement is based on the pressure rise method. The apparatus is a welded all-metal system in which all valves have metal poppets and seats except two that use Viton O-rings. On the vacuum side, the pressure rise side, pressures are measured with a capacitance manometer for the high-permeability measurements and are monitored with a calibrated helium leak detector for the low-permeability measurements. The system is designed to measure hollow cylindrical specimens, such as the HFIR irradiation specimens, and solid disks.

Ties of several grades of graphite that we are studying at this time. Mechanical property measurements on a number of these are reported in samples, and the structural variations normally found in graphite relegate these to being representative.

The mechanical properties of several types of graphite are being studied since the properties are very sensitive to the structure. We are performing bend tests at room temperature and using a small specimen because we are limited in the quantity of material and wish to make selective samplings. Comparative tests of samples varying in size have been made and demonstrate that the sample size is adequate for the finer-grained MSBR grades. The sample is wide and is loaded in a four-point bend apparatus.

With 1% in. between the outer supports and 4 in. between the inner supports, although we have confidence in these data, they should be considered only as relative values and should not be used as engineering data without further testing to determine size effects.

Table 19. 4. The anisotropy of the graphite is easily observed in the fracture stress and elastic modulus values obtained for grades 1425, ATJ-S, and 9567. However, the work to fracture, which is more representative of the defect structure, appears to be isotropic.

There are several factors in the fabrication of the graphite that must be considered in interpreting the results. One is the effect of impregnation, which significantly alters and improves the mechanical behavior of the material. An example of the influence and difficulty of controlling the impregnation process is seen in the results obtained for.

Graphites H337E, H364, and H337PL. These three materials originate from the same base stock. H337E was fabricated in the laboratory; H364 in a small pilot facility; and H337PL in larger, more commercial equipment. The apparent inability to easily control the impregnation processing clarifies why it is one of the more proprietary areas, and very little information is obtained from the vendors. Although some improvement has been observed by impregnation, not all of the various impregnants used to improve the mechanical behavior will retain the necessary binder integrity under irradiation to yield an extended life.

Another factor is a duplex type of defect structure caused by multiple forming operations during processing. This type of structure can be identified by dense, low-porosity regions of coke particle clusters bound to one another with a fairly large defect structure between the clusters. The mechanical test is quite sensitive to the large defects, and the work to fracture will be small, as observed from the results for grades HCTE 21 and HCTE 22. It is very probable that these large defects will limit the life under irradiation; however, this type of duplex structure will very likely have a greater life than materials having the same size defect uniformly distributed throughout the structure.

In general, the bend test does yield information about the quality of the binder structure in the graphite. However, these data must be interpreted with regard to the fabrication procedures and resulting structures. There likely will not be a direct relation between the mechanical properties and irradiation lifetime; however, we believe that extended lifetime under irradiation will not be obtainable from materials exhibiting a low work-to.

One of the problems associated with the collection and interpretation of X-ray data on graphite is the low absorption this material has for X-rays. This property results in the broadening of the diffraction maxima and an effective sample displacement from the center of the X-ray diffract.

On the "c" than on the "a" parameter. Thus, the results will depend on the sample thickness and can give rise to incorrect conclusions about the perfection of the crystalline structure or the crystallite size. Techniques are being investigated to eliminate or limit the errors which arise because of the low absorption graphite has for X-rays from a copper target.

Graphites are being studied in our HFIR irradiation program. Three grades of graphite furnished by Y-12 have been checked for anisotropy using an integrated intensity ratio of the diffraction from the basal planes taken from the longitudinal and transverse directions of the material. These materials show a high degree of preferred orientation, as shown in Table 19. 6. Nonuniform distribution of basal planes may also be present in materials fabricated by other techniques. A pole figure technique for determining the distribution of planes in the material is being investigated.

One of the requirements for graphite to be used in a molten-salt breeder reactor is a surface with low permeability to prevent xenon absorption. Calculations suggest that a helium permeability of less than 10^-8 cm/sec at the graphite surface will be required to keep the xenon concentration in the core to the desired level. It is necessary to consider sealing the graphite surface by some means, since commercially available fine-grained graphites usually have permeabilities some five or six orders of magnitude higher than this required level.

Carbon is the preferred surface sealing material because it does not impose the parasitic neutron absorption penalties associated with refractory metals. Since the crystalline character of a pyrolytic carbon deposit is likely to be different from the base graphite, the pyrolytic carbon, if applied simply as a surface coating, may spall during irradiation due to different rates of neutron-induced dimensional changes. However, if the carbon can be deposited in the pores beneath the surface, the sealant may stay intact during irradiation.

The gas-impregnation method we are studying employs a chamber that is cycled between vacuum and hydrocarbon atmospheres while the graphite substrate is inductively heated to temperatures of 800 to 1000°C. The important variables under consideration are substrate temperature, frequency of the vacuum and hydrocarbon exposure cycles, and substrate porosity. By using this vacuum-pressure pulsing technique, we have sealed graphite specimens to helium permeabilities of less than 1. 3 x 10^7 cm/sec, a level which was retained even after 3000°C heat treatments.

The specimen geometry was selected to meet the requirements of the HFIR irradiation facility; a hollow right cylinder of nominal dimensions. The graphites used for substrates are either Poco grades selected to provide irradiation dimensional stability and to study the effects of different pore-size materials upon the total processing times required to seal the specimens.

ATJ-SG graphite has approximately 60% of its pores greater than 0. 8 μ, while the pores of the Poco are nearly all less than 0. 8 μ. The ATJ-SG has at least a factor of 10 greater permeability than the Poco and appears to require about twice as long to seal as the Poco does at a given temperature.

We have reduced the total process time required to seal a specimen by studying the effects of varying process parameters. The process is quite sensitive to temperature, with the rate of deposition generally increasing with increasing temperature. However, high temperature favors the formation of surface coatings with little penetration into the substrate. These factors limit the temperature range of interest to 800 to 1000°C.

Great increases with increasing vacuum pressure cycle frequency, but there is a practical maximum above which loss of penetration results. Increasing the hydrocarbon exposure from 1 sec to 1 sec slightly shortens the process time needed for sealing. We increased the sealing.

For evaluating the depth of carbon impregnation, we have developed a procedure employing subsequent mercury impregnation and then radiographic examination. Disks 5 to 20 mils thick are cut perpendicular to the axis of the carbon-impregnated specimen and then subjected to various pressures of mercury. At certain pressures (1000 to 5000 psi for Poco), the mercury will penetrate only the pores not impregnated with carbon, making those sections opaque to X-rays. The carbon-impregnated areas are then clearly visible. At 100 psi, the mercury penetrates all pores larger than the mercury pressure; we can observe where the effective carbon sealant is located. Figure 19. 3 shows a 10-mil-thick section from a specimen that has been carbon sealed at 800°C. The disk was pressurized to 1000 psig in mercury and then radiographed.

At higher mercury pressures, the darker rim became thinner, indicating that the effective sealant is located near the surface of the substrate. The maximum depth of carbon penetration, as shown in Fig. 3, is about 15 mils. The depth of penetration needed for effective sealing must be determined from results of irradiation behavior.

We prepared 12 specimens for irradiation in the HFIR. The substrates were machined from Poco grade AXF graphite, and some were heat treated to 3000°C prior to impregnation at various temperatures. The samples are being irradiated in the HFIR to a fluence of ~1 x 10^72 neutrons/cm. The behavior of these specimens should provide us with information as to the type of sealant and depth of sealant penetration needed to maintain a sufficiently low permeability during high fast-neutron exposure.

Finally, these samples verified that most of the air-fired samples could not be sealed sufficiently by an acceptable amount of molybdenum (0. 2 mil). A differential pressure coating technique for depositing the molybdenum in the graphite pores had been attempted previously but was hampered by the inability to obtain a vacuum seal around the graphite during heating. A technique for brazing specimens to a molybdenum tube was developed by the Welding and Brazing Laboratory. The time of deposition varied from 5 to 20 min, and all samples were annealed at 600°C in argon prior to coating. Despite the anneal, four samples had fingerprints which destroyed the effectiveness of the coating. Inhomogeneous nodular deposits formed on some samples, but we obtained sufficient data to predict that 0. 2 mil.

More molybdenum would be necessary for even a completely homogeneous coating to reduce the helium permeability to the desired range. A radiograph of a 20-mil section of a coated sample showed that very little penetration into the graphite was achieved with the differential pressure.

Before the radial spacers could be removed to slide the specimens off the stainless steel support tube, there was also a graphite-stainless steel interaction, and some of the graphite specimens were bonded to the stainless steel support tubes. This required excessive force to remove the specimens, and some were broken, cracked, or chipped. However, only one specimen was too badly broken for length measurements to be taken.

Graphite support structure is used in place of the stainless steel. Unfortunately, the time required for design and fabrication would cause a serious delay in the irradiation schedule, and the specimens from these two experiments are being recycled in a similar stainless steel assembly. We plan to construct future experiments with a graphite support structure. Dimensional measurements have been made on the samples from the first two experiments. The results of the linear dimensional changes are given.

Before discussing the trends indicated by the data, we emphasize that the curves were obtained from a maximum of three points, and that further irradiations are required to confirm the indicated trends. The materials that have the smallest volume change are grades AXF and H364 (both have the highest degree of isotropy). Both of these materials seem to expand slightly and then begin to densify with increasing exposure. These two grades are high-quality products with a very fine evenly dispersed porosity and a structure which appears to be very well binded. In the case of the AXF grade, the binder cannot be identified, and the structure appears to be a well-integrated single phase. In the H364 material, we cannot identify the initial coke particles by metallographic examination. The structure is also very well binded, with evidence of heavy impregnations. We expect these well-binded products to exhibit very small volume changes and even a small expansion under irradiation. However, this tendency for densification after a large exposure has not been observed previously in other graphites, and at present, the rationale for such behavior is not understood.

The AXF samples chosen to examine the influence of final heat treatment and impregnation have produced results of considerable significance. There is a slight effect of graphitizing temperature and impregnation; however, the main significance is the lack of difference in behavior. These results amplify the importance of isotropy and binder integrity in obtaining a dimensionally stable product. These factors appear to overshadow the effects of high-temperature graphitizing treatments. This conclusion may be premature in that long-term stability may be influenced by heat treatment.

The dimensional changes of the other two fairly isotropic graphites, grades UK-Iso and H315-A, are quite similar. Both of these materials are more stable than the common anisotropic reactor grades such as AGOT. These two materials, along with AGOT, were placed in this experiment primarily to have a direct comparison with previous data from other reactors.

Of raw materials and fabrication on the dimensional stability under irradiation. A comparison of the grades BY-12, RY-12-29, and RY-12-31 indicates an anomalous behavior. It would be expected that both RY-12-29 and RY-12-31, having a less graphitic structure, would have a shorter lifetime than BY-12. However, the data indicate that RY-12-29 and BY-12 attained their minimum volume and began to expand, and thus may or may not have a shortened lifetime, depending upon the rate of expansion.

The diffraction and scattering of X-rays by crystalline substances can be used to learn many things about the arrangement of atoms within the crystal. When the crystal is perfect, X-rays will be diffracted only when the Bragg law is satisfied, and there will be some low-intensity scattering due to thermal vibrations. However, real crystals normally contain imperfections which cause diffraction to occur under conditions other than those specified by the Bragg law. Measurements of this scattering, called diffuse scattering, can be used to characterize the defects present in the crystal. We feel that this technique has much promise for looking at the defects produced in graphite by irradiation and thus would help us learn more about the mechanism(s) responsible for radiation damage in graphite.

X-ray diffraction studies of hot-pressed pyrolytic graphite were undertaken to characterize the structure of the most perfect graphite available. This material is of theoretical density, and the basal planes are parallel to the extent that the full width at half height of the rocking curve is 0.6 to 0.35°. However, the basal planes of graphite are randomly oriented with respect to rotation about the c axis. This material is monochromator-grade graphite from Union Carbide Corporation. Measurements of x-ray line breadths show no detectable broadening due to particle sizes being less than about 1500 Å or due to strain.

Carbon is present, as all the diffuse intensity can be attributed to Compton scattering and thermal diffuse scattering. All the detectable temperature diffuse scattering is distributed along the c direction, and the spread is as narrow as the mosaic spread in the crystal. Thus, the only detectable thermal oscillation of the atoms is perpendicular to the basal plane.

The structural changes that take place when this material is irradiated in a reactor are being interpreted through preliminary results in terms of displaced atoms, resulting in increased diffuse scattering. Additionally, small-angle scattering measurements are being conducted to verify the high-angle results for highly perfect graphite and will be used to measure electron density variations resulting from irradiation.

Been investigated, we shall consider only the results for specimens irradiated at 500 to 650°C in order to assess the effects of our titanium modification on high-temperature irradiation damage. We shall compare the behavior of the small laboratory melts with that of larger commercial melts of this material.

Stress-rupture life plot based on the few data in point 1. All data are for the preirradiation treatment of a 1-hr anneal at 1177°C in argon; increases markedly with increasing titanium but undoubtedly they reflect differences in (1) levels from approximately 5 hr at zero titanium grain size and (2) thermal aging during the ir- to 3000 hr at 1. 2% titanium. At 760°C, where radiation cycle due to variations in titanium content, a beneficial strengthening effect of titanium. The ranges result from uncertainties due to the titanium. 2% than was observed at the 650°C. The postirradiation fracture strain for the commercial heats varied from 2–5% for the heats containing less than 0%.

The post-irradiation stress-rupture properties are examined for comparative purposes, although the data are also provided in Table 20. 1, and the variations are not tabulated. We observed that the rupture life with titanium content is demonstrated in laboratory heats of unirradiated Hastelloy N.

Maintaining increasing titanium concentrations and stressed at 40,000 psi and 650°C had rupture lives from 45 to 1050 hr. 0%. The fracture strain for the laboratory melts showed an increase with titanium level from 10 to 27% over the range of titanium.

The postirradiation creep-rupture results obtained on our laboratory melts are shown in Fig. 20.2. The stress levels are different from those used for the commercial alloys. However, the curves have very similar shapes and generally agree quite well. One possible significant difference is that at 760°C, the properties of the laboratory heats show continued improvements, whereas the commercial heats indicate that titanium levels above 0. 5% cause no further improvement. This may be due to an effect of ir.

As part of our evaluation of commercial heats of titanium-modified Hastelloy N, we are investigating the thermal stability in the absence of irradiation. Since the presence of titanium may affect the aging tendency of the alloys, we are conducting an aging program on four commercial heats. Each alloy nominally contains Ni-12% Mo-7% Cr-0.2% Mn-0.06% C, with 1.2% being the only significant variable. We are presently using the change in the tensile properties at 650°C and a strain rate of 0.002 min- to measure aging in these alloys. Aging temperatures of 760 and 650°C are examined for three pre-age heat treatments: 1 hr at 1177°C, prestrain at room temperature. We shall eventually have data for aging times of 1500, 3000, and 10,000 hr; however, at present, only the 3000-hr age results are complete.

The changes in the yield strength and the total elongation due to aging following our standard solution anneal of 1 hr at 1177°C are dependent on both the titanium content and the aging temperature. Aging at 650°C results in an increase in total elongation from approximately 30 to 40% for the three higher titanium levels and a decrease for the lowest titanium level. 2% titanium level.

Improvement and negative values indicate a reduction in property with aging. Thus, each point should represent a percentage change due to aging alone. After aging at 650°C, the ductility varies appreciably with titanium content. Generally, at low levels, the ductility is reduced.

At 0.5% titanium, the ductility increases; and at 1. The yield strength increases due to aging, the magnitude of the increase diminishing with increasing titanium content. Using a higher solution annealing temperature (1260°C) or room-temperature prestraining prior to aging results generally in higher strengths and lower ductilities for both.

As shown in 5, the aging at 760°C has resulted in a large (30–60%) loss in ductility for each heat treatment, except at the 1.2% titanium level. The yield strengths increase on aging at 760°C, except for the sample prestrained 10% prior to aging.

The optical microstructures after aging at 760°C for 3000 hours are shown in Figure 6. The three lower titanium levels appear similar, and the properties of each were also equivalent. However, the sample with 1. 2% titanium exhibits precipitation, primarily along bands which probably resulted from fabrication. This particular sample showed an increased tensile ductility, yet the large variation in properties of this heat may be partly attributable to local inhomogeneities within the original ingot, which are evident as localized stringers of precipitate particles.

The magnitude of the observed aging effect at 760°C after 3000 hr is cause for some concern because we expect creep conditions and neutron irradiation to further reduce the fracture ductility. The role of titanium in the aging process is somewhat confusing, and it appears that titanium may actually be inhibiting rather than causing.

Our first mechanical property tests on the titanium-modified Hastelloy N were run with samples that had been irradiated at 650°C, and we found that the properties were excellent at test temperatures of 760 and 650°C. In additional experiments, we irradiated samples over a broad temperature range for 1000 hr to a thermal fluence of 3 x 10 neutrons/cm and ran post-irradiation creep tests at 650 and 760°C. The stress-rupture properties of these samples at 650°C are shown in Figure 7. Three heats of material were involved, with each having the nominal composition Ni—12% Mo—7% Cr—0. 2% produced by two different commercial vendors. The samples of heat 66-548 failed in shorter times when irradiated at temperatures of 704°C and above.

The variation of the minimum creep rate with stress level is shown for these same samples. In general, the minimum creep rate is not significantly different in the irradiated and unirradiated conditions as long as the irradiation temperature does not exceed 660°C. When irradiated above 704°C, the post-irradiation creep rate is increased. Several of the samples were tested at 760°C, and these results are shown. The creep-rupture properties of all the titanium-modified alloys are superior to those of irradiated standard Hastelloy N at 760°C. However, the results on heats 66-548 and 21545 give some indication of an effect of irradiation temperature, with the rupture life being reduced as the irradiation temperature is increased.

The fracture strains are shown in 0.10 as a function of the minimum creep rate for tests at 760 and 650°C. Previous studies have shown that the scatter band in Fig. 20. 10 holds for air and vacuum-melted standard Hastelloy N when irradiated and tested at common temperatures.

PTT TTT, these samples show an improvement in fracture strain over that of irradiated standard Hastelloy 8600 paved in. The samples irradiated at 704°C and above in tests showing shorter rupture lives. AY 760 modified Hastelloy N (Ni-12% Mo-7% Cr-0.2% & me Mn-0.05% C) without the titanium addition also at 600 showed a marked deterioration of postirradiation. A significant difference in the behavior of the modified alloys with and without titanium is that STANDARD 20. 11 recovers its strength as the stress level.

Alloy at 700°C. We have also found that a similar alloy without titanium shows similar behavior. This led us to question whether such effects are universal for Hastelloy N. We have never performed an experiment directed at evaluating the effects of irradiation temperature on the creep-rupture properties of Hastelloy N. Such an experiment is being carried out.

The microstructure of the titanium-modified alloy is quite different from that of the standard material. Major compositional changes that affect the microstructure and precipitates which form include decreasing the molybdenum from 16%. As a result, the M23C6-type precipitates, which comprise the stringer and grain-boundary phases in the original version of the alloy, are absent.

Unlike the standard alloy, precipitates in the modified Hastelloy N are put into solid solution at normal annealing temperatures. Exposure at temperatures similar to those expected in service results in both grain boundary and matrix precipitation. Figure 20. 12 shows a typical mode of precipitation in and adjacent to the grain boundaries after aging at 650°C for 1500 hr. Preliminary indications suggest that the precipitates are of the Mo, C type. Exposure at 760°C for similar times results in precipitation of spherical particles of the Mo, C type.

In contrast to the specimen irradiated at 635°C (which exhibited good creep ductility), the grain boundaries of the one irradiated at 703°C were free of precipitate. Owing to the low 0. 85 hr rupture life, the matrix and grain boundaries are quite strain-free. Bubbles were observed quite frequently in grain boundaries and occasionally in the matrix. Figure 20. 15 shows typical bubbles in a grain boundary.

Bubbles were not observed in the material irradiated at 635°C. It is possible that the grain boundary precipitates would mask bubbles if they were present since the strain fields associated with the particles are quite large compared with usual bubble sizes. Because of the strain which the sample received, the grain boundaries are not sharp as in the case of the 703°C material. Thus, if bubbles are present after irradiation at the lower temperatures, we have not been able to observe them. We are planning to examine unstressed sections from the above specimens which should provide some clarification as to the effect of irradiation alone.

Considering the structures we have found in the irradiated specimens, the difference in mechanical properties is not surprising. The microstructure in. 14 would inhibit the propagation of a grain boundary crack, whereas that in. 15 would favor propagation. We are not able to explain the differences in structures on the basis of the few samples examined.

And we are studying the weldability of this material. The previous welding studies on 100-lb heats had shown that the weldability of the titanium-modified alloy was good under low-restraint conditions. However, the availability of the 5000-lb heat gave us the first opportunity to make high-restraint welds in large plates. -diam wire was used for the first three passes and -in. -diam wire for subsequent passes. One edge of each plate was prepared for welding, and the two plates were welded to a 2-in. -thick steel strongback to provide a high degree of restraint.

The first weld was made using 14 passes. Upon completion, it was removed from the strongback and radiographed. A number of cracks were seen on the radiograph. The weld was sectioned, and both photomacrographs and photomicrographs were taken. Figure 20. 16 illustrates the types of cracks seen in this weld. These are among the most severe seen during the subsequent welding study. Figure 20. 17 shows the fusion line and heat-affected zone areas of the weld. Cracking is not a problem in the base metal. Weld 2 was made under similar conditions to weld 1 except that the surfaces of individual passes were also inspected by dye-penetrant techniques. It was found that the first weld pass (root pass) was sound; however, when the second weld pass was deposited, the first cracked. These cracks were both parallel and transverse to the welding direction.

In view of the cracking that resulted from welding heat 7320 with itself, we decided to lay out a systematic welding program using the were made under the highly restrained conditions discussed previously. Weld No. 4 was made using weld wire from a previously accepted heat (5090) of standard air-melted Hastelloy N. This weld was completed with no crack indications from both radiographic and dye-penetrant techniques. Subsequent metallographic studies substantiated these observations.

Using the specified procedure and filler metal from Heat 7320, again, the root pass cracked when the second pass was deposited. Welds 6 and 7 were made with both filler and base metal from Heats 67-526 (Hastelloy N with 0. 5% Ti) and 67-550 (modified Hastelloy N with 0. 7% Ti), respectively, and no cracking occurred. This confirmed previous studies that these heats were.

Additional welds were made using base metal of heat 7320 and various filler metals. These welds are also summarized in section 18. In all instances where heat 7320 was used as the filler metal, cracking occurred in the root pass when the second weld pass was deposited. However, successful welds were made in heat 7320 with filler metal from both heats 67-526 and 67-550. These welds are identified as 12 and 13.

Specimens were sectioned from welds 4, 12, and 13 and subjected to side-bend tests. As shown in Figure 19, all these welds successfully withstood a 180° bend without any indication of cracks. This side-bend test is severe and is used extensively in code qualifications. If small difficult-to-detect fissures are present in the weldment, they will open during bending.

Of three different welds failed to reveal any inhomogeneous distribution of alloying elements or impurities near cracks. If an element(s) is responsible for the cracking, it was not present in concentrations high enough to be detected by the microprobe analyzer.

We also deposited a weld in an inert-gas welding chamber containing high-purity helium with a nitrogen content of about 5 ppm. The plates were under medium restraint during welding. The joint was dye-penetrant inspected after the third pass, and the weld metal was found to be crack-free. A few very small indications were noted on the surface. These were easily removed by a minimal amount of grinding, and four side-bend specimens were prepared and tested. After a 180° bend, all four contained cracks concentrated in the root region of the.

We also investigated the effects of post-weld heat treatments on cracking of bead-on-plate welds. These gas tungsten arc welds were made with heat 7320 filler metal deposited on heat 7320 plate. Two sequences were studied. The first consisted of annealing the plate and the first pass at 870°C for 4 hours; then two subsequent weld beads were deposited. The second bead overlapped the heat-treated bead, and the third bead overlapped the un-heat-treated bead. The weld bead annealed at 870°C contained a few small.

A multitude of cracks; thus, post-weld heat treating at 870°C did minimize the cracking. The second series of welds was similar to the first, except that the first weld bead was annealed at 1180°C for 4 hr. The 1180°C post-weld heat treatment eliminated the cracks in the first pass, but the second pass (not heat-treated) did crack when the third pass was deposited.

Metallographic investigation of the welds showed that the 1180°C heat treatment produced a clean, coarse-grained microstructure with no typical weld-metal cast structure (all evidence of welding was removed). On the other hand, the 870°C heat treatment had little visual effect on the weld-metal cast structure. This experiment does seem to support the thesis that microsegregation of some element (or elements) is responsible for the cracking and that its effect can be negated by a homogenizing post-weld heat treatment. However, the 1180°C temperature is entirely too high for consideration as a step in the fabrication procedure.

Arc-melting at 7320°C under a partial vacuum, with no additions, was conducted. Two other melts used heat 7320 with alloy additions to provide alloys, indicating that small amounts of these elements might be beneficial in reducing cracking. These melts were drawn to wire and used as filler rods. The base metal for these welds was the same thickness heat 7320 plate used in the studies discussed heretofore. The results were negative and were nearly identical to those observed previously; that is, the first weld pass cracked when the second was deposited.

As a result of these studies, we conclude that heat 7320 is a weldable base metal. There is no indication of a problem in the heat-affected zone. However, it is not an acceptable filler metal. In no instance was a crack-free weld produced with filler metal from it. The excellent welds in heats 67-526 and 67-550 indicate that the titanium-modified alloy can be welded using similar filler metals. The studies to date indicate that the cracking is due to the segregation of element(s) presently unidentified.

We are investigating the effects of welding conditions and post-weld heat treatment on the distribution and magnitude of the residual stresses in Hastelloy N. These earlier studies involved the investigation of the effects of stress.

Relief treatments and gas shielding (helium vs. argon) on the resultant residual stress patterns. The residual stress patterns were similar for argon and helium shielding; however, the maximum residual stress was about 5% higher when helium was used. All these welds were made with a heat input of 15,000 J/in.

We have expanded this work to include a post-weld anneal of 4% hr at 870°C on welds made with both argon and helium shielding gases. In addition, we have investigated a post-weld heat treatment of 650°C for 100 hours on a weld shielded with argon. The welding parameters used for these weldments were identical to those reported previously.

Table 20. 4 contains the data obtained from a weldment deposited at 7500 J/in. (vs 15,000 J/in. for the previously discussed weldments). The lower heat input decreased the peak tangential residual stresses; however, it has essentially no effect on the radial stresses. Figure 20. 20 shows the residual stress pattern obtained for each of these conditions. The dotted line in the postweld heat-treatment data (20a) is a best approximation of residual stresses in that area, since we encountered unexplained hard spots during machining which produced erratic strain gauge measurements.

Thus, we have found that lower heat input and post-weld heat treatments are very effective in reducing the residual stresses in Hastelloy N weldments. Heat treatments as low as 650°C for 100 hours cause some improvements, whereas treatments of 4. 5 and 6 hours at 870°C, and 1 hour at 1180°C reduce the stresses to negligible values.

Loop 1258, constructed of type 304L stainless steel and containing the same salt as loop 1255, has operated for about 5. 1 years with only minor changes in flow characteristics. A specimen exposed to the highest temperature, 688°C (1270°F), was removed for detailed metallurgical analysis after 5700 hours of exposure between May 1967 and February 1968. (An original specimen exposed for 3700 hours was permanently damaged after the measurement of weight changes. ) Figure 20. 21 shows the microstructure of the specimen. As the constituent with the higher reactivity, in this case, chromium (proved by salt analyses), is depleted from the alloy, the vacancies accumulate to form visible voids. The depth of the voids in this specimen is 2. 5 mils.

Diffusion-controlled corrosion processes. Due to age, many of the thermocouples are no longer operable on this loop, so a thermocouple was placed in the salt in the hot leg, and an accurate temperature profile was obtained. Present readings indicate the salt is about 10°C hotter than indicated by the old surface thermocouples. The diffusion coefficients calculated from these new data are only slightly different from those previously reported; that is, 4.

Loop NCL-16, the first two-fluid MSBR fuel salt natural circulation loop incorporating the new loop design, has operated for 4755 hr. A plot of the weight change of all the specimens as a function of time and temperature is given in Fig. 23. It can be seen that for hot-leg specimens, the titanium-modified alloy specimens at 704°C (1300°F).

At 676°C (1250°F), there are smaller weight changes compared to the standard Hastelloy N specimens at 660°C (1220°F). The calculation of the diffusion coefficient from weight change data on the modified alloy specimen at the highest temperature was conducted after 4700 hours of exposure and was determined to be 5.0 x 10-14 cm/sec at 704°C. This finding aligns with published data on chromium diffusion in Hastelloy N, where experiments were carried out in fuel salts.

The calculation was based only on chromium removal since the titanium-modified specimens contain no iron. Increases in chromium (from 15 to 200 ppm) and iron (from 35 to 95 ppm) have been noted in the salt; most of the increase, no doubt, comes from the loop piping.

Loop 19 is completely installed and ready for a flush charge. It is constructed of standard Hastelloy N and will be filled with a fertile-fissile salt that will contact molten bismuth in a molybdenum hot finger. If bismuth is even slightly soluble in.

The operation of NCL-15, containing a typical two-fluid MSBR blanket salt, was interrupted after 2000 hr as a result of a blown fuse. The salt in the loop was frozen before power was restored, and when heat was applied to thaw the salt, the hot leg ruptured (0.24). The ruptured area, which still contained frozen salt, was cut from the loop, and another piece of tubing was attached by means of compression-type fittings. Then the loop was heated, the salt was melted and dumped, and the test specimens were removed. The temporary fitting was removed, and the joints to be welded were reamed to remove any remaining salt and corroded metal and filed to provide the proper weld joint configuration. Welding was done in conformance with specifications PS-23 and PS-25 and inspected under specification MET-WR-200. The first welding attempt was unsuccessful because of poor penetration from excessive gas pressure in the loop.

A plot of the weight change of all the specimens from NCL-15 before the loop failure is given in Figure 25 as a function of time and temperature. Similar to the results from NCL-16, the titanium-modified specimens exhibit smaller weight changes than the standard alloy specimens. The diffusion coefficient was calculated from weight change data after 1600 hr of operation and found to be.

For over 4000 hours, NCL-13 and -14, containing the NaBF4-NaF (92-8 mole %) fluoroborate salt, operated under identical conditions. Loop NCL-13 contained standard Hastelloy N specimens, and NCL-14 contained titanium-modified Hastelloy N specimens.

After 4700 hours of operation, the helium gas regulator, which provides the overpressure to NCL-13, failed and caused a surge of gas to the loop, which stopped the salt flow. Circulation of the salt could not be resumed until a vacuum was pulled on the loop, which we believe removed a gas pocket. Shortly after circulation was achieved, an electrical short, which eventually burned out a heater, occurred and heated the bottom of the hot leg to 871°C (1600°F). This disrupted the flow, caused a loss of BF from the loop, which changed the salt composition, and plugged all the gas lines. The loop was drained of all salt and plugged lines.

The weight changes measured for the specimens in NCL-13 and -14 after 4300 hr of exposure to the salt showed increases above those expected on the basis of the prior behavior (. 26). This was accompanied by perturbations in salt chemistry. Salt analyses of the circulating salts from NCL-13 and -14 showed increases in both H2O and oxygen contents from <1000 to >2000 ppm and increases in nickel and molybdenum from <25 to >100 ppm along with a normal increase of chromium and iron. The increase of the chromium and iron content in the salt with time is shown in.

The dumped salt from NCL-13 was chemically analyzed, and the results are given in Table 20. 8. The Cr, Fe, Ni, Mo, O, and H2O contents of the salt all show large increases since the loop began operation. Increases in the nickel and molybdenum content of the salt are usually indicative of the onset of stronger oxidizing conditions, usually due to the increased water and/or oxygen content. Thus, the most obvious explanation of the chemical changes and increased weight changes is the presence of water contamination that produces HF, which attacks all the constituents of the con.

Introduced into both loops at the same time. Three possible sources are (1) impure helium - the loops had a common helium header, but the helium is high-purity stock, analyzed prior to use to assure its purity; (2) impurities on the hanger rods - these rods were changed out in both loops just before the high corrosion rates were noticed; and (3) impurities on the specimens - the specimens were removed, weighed, and replaced in each loop at about the same time. We took normal precautions to avoid contamination via sources 2 and 3 but are presently reexamining our procedures.

While specimens were taken out of NCL-13 and NCL-14 for weighing after 4000 hours of exposure to fluoroborate salt, the hottest and coldest specimens from each loop were cut in half and sent for microprobe analysis to determine possible composition gradients due to mass transfer. Initial results showed that a large amount of cobalt had deposited on both the hot- and cold-leg specimens.

Investigations were immediately launched to determine the source of the cobalt, and it was discovered that the specimen support rods were Haynes alloy No. 25 (Co—19% Cr—14% W—9% Ni—1% Fe) rather than Hastelloy N. Further investigation revealed that the source of the yen. Haynes alloy No. 25 material was a misidentified storage carton. Subsequently, the specimens and hangers were removed from NCL-13 and NCL-14, and the specimen hanger rods were replaced with ½-in. Hastelloy N. Metallurgical examination was made of the Haynes alloy No. 25 rod and the Hastelloy N specimens.

Samples of the Haynes alloy No. 25 rod were taken at various elevations and analyzed by X-ray fluorescence. It was found that chromium and cobalt were leached from the rod in all positions. It appears that two modes of mass transfer were operable: temperature gradient mass transfer.

We took advantage of the situation to learn something about the kinetics of cobalt movement in the system. The amount of cobalt in the cold-leg specimen was determined as a function of position. Using a solution to Fick's second law, the diffusion coefficient of cobalt in the Hastelloy N was determined and found to be 5.6 x 10^7 cm/sec at 465°C (870°F). Comparable work in somewhat similar systems has been done at much higher temperatures, where extrapolation to lower temperatures could become quite erroneous due to grain-boundary diffusion and/or short-circuiting. Titanium.

It was concluded that the presence of the Haynes alloy No. 25 in the fluoroborate salt—Hastelloy N system caused variations in the weight change measurements of the specimens but only to a maximum extent of 10%. This figure is well within the experimental accuracy and therefore no changes.

In cooperation with the MIT Practice School, measurements of the flow velocity of the salt in NCL-1258 and NCL-14 have been made. A two-counter method was used, with the radioactive isotope introduced into the loop as a solid salt. By inserting these velocities, physical properties of the salt, and other quantities into flow equations, we obtained values for previously unknown variables. The calculated flow velocity was 1.3 fpm.

The MSR-FCL-1 forced circulation loop is being operated to evaluate the compatibility of standard Hastelloy N with NaBF4-NaF (92-8 mole %) coolant salt at conditions similar to those expected in the MSRE coolant circuit. During this reporting period, the loop assembly was completed, and circulation, the thermal insulation was installed. Figure 20. 29 is a photograph of the completed loop installed in the test facility.

A decision was made to alter the originally proposed loop temperature profile to more nearly approximate the MSR coolant circuit conditions with fluoroborate salt. 9. These changes in operating temperature impose a higher salt temperature at the pump bowl.

Reduce the possibility of a change in salt composition. The original plan for this test loop was to purge the LFB pump oil seal with a gas mixture of 1% BF₂ in helium. Earlier long-term tests had indicated that small (0. 1% by volume) concentrations of BF₂ in helium would not greatly affect the Gulfspin-35 oil used on the pump seal. However, the temperature increase at the pump bowl required a purge gas mixture of 3% BF₂ in helium to match the new salt BF₂ vapor pressure, and it was necessary to examine the effects of He-3% BF₂ gas mixture on Gulfspin-35 pump oil under conditions.

Which would simulate its use in the LFB pump seal oil system. The results of the two separate room-temperature tests of approximately one week's duration with a predicted test loop gas flow rate of 80 cc/min and a seal oil leakage rate of 10 cc/day indicated that the seal oil purge line would probably become plugged during loop operation. A black sludge was formed in the simulated oil catch basin which, in the first test, eventually plugged the 0. 5-inch overflow port. In both tests, the oil removed from the test apparatus was darkened. A large amount of black sludge formed in the bottom of the simulated seal oil catch basin.

Attempts to determine the composition of the oil sludge were not successful. However, the effect of BF on Gulfspin-35 is similar to, but more severe than, effects noted during a previous 3500 hr experiment in which the BF concentration in the gas phase was about 0. 1% by volume. The conclusions from this previous test were that BF does not polymerize the oil to a degree that would change its viscosity, but evidently some unidentified oil additives are seriously degraded. These findings, together with those obtained on the PKP loop test, are being evaluated further by the Analytical Chemistry Division.

These tests indicated that the He-3% BF mixture should not be used for the pump seal purge. A system was designed, and necessary equipment was procured to provide a method of adding BF directly to the pump bowl. With the newly designed system, the BF must diffuse up an annulus around the pump shaft against a helium stream before it can contact the oil in the seal leakage catch basin.

To expedite loop startup, the sodium fluoroborate cleaning charge in the test loop was circulated without BF addition to the pump bowl. A flow of pure helium was used to purge oil leakage from the pump oil catch basin. Modification to the seal purge system will be made after the cleaning charge has been removed. The 4-inch-OD copper tubing vent line for the test loop pump seal purge plugged approximately two weeks after the He-3% BF mixture was vented through the line during calibration of the thermal conductivity cell. A crystalline reaction product completely sealed the end of the Y-in. tube and stopped the seal purge. An acid solution was found in a vertical section of the line when it was removed to correct the plugged condition. This same condition occurred twice in the week.

Long-cleaning charge operation of the salt loop, where the effluent 80 cc/min helium purge picked up about 0. 5% BF from the pump bowl. The second plug was tight enough that it held a 4-psig pressure. In all instances of plugging of these lines, it was necessary to remove the end of the vent line to restart the purge system. The plug is apparently boric acid, which is formed by the reaction of BF and moisture. Additional equipment will be required in these vent lines to eliminate the BF and air reaction at the end of the pump seal vent. Acid has also formed in ventilation hoods in the vicinity of the BF vent lines. Enough acid has been present to form droplets on the lower edges of the hoods.

The desire for improved radiation resistance prompted a modification of Hastelloy N. A study was made of the effects of various alloying additions on the scaling resistance. Small rods 0.25 in. in diameter were oxidized at 982°C for 1000 hr with cycling to room temperature every 25 hr.

Figures 20.30 and 20.31 summarize the effects of various alloying additions on the scaling resistance of Hastelloy N. The titanium and zirconium additions were made to remelts of commercial air-melted Hastelloy N, and the other alloys were made from virgin melting stock. The results are complicated by the fact that the effects of the various elements are not independent of one another. For example, we find that manganese is slightly detrimental when added to a base alloy containing no silicon but beneficial when added to an alloy containing 0.5% Si.

The two-fluid MSBR concept required that graphite pipes be joined to a Hastelloy N header, and we began work to develop this joint. This work was quite rewarding, and several methods of joining were partially developed, along with inspection procedures. However, the present single-fluid concept does not require such a joint in the core, and we have curtailed this work. Graphite looks attractive from a compatibility standpoint for use in making chemical processing equipment, and some of the techniques for joining graphite and Hastelloy N will very likely be useful for this.

Using procedures that we previously established for brazing molybdenum to molybdenum-coated graphite with copper, we assembled a large graphite-molybdenum-Hastelloy N transition joint. The components were approximately 3% examined visually and radiographically and found to be sound.

Small samples of graphite subjected to each treatment were wetted with the 35Au-35Ni-30Mo (wt%) alloy and with the Ni-Pd-Cr alloy. Metallographic examination of the samples revealed no differences in wettability within each set of brazed specimens. A clean machined surface. The 1-hour air anneal at 600°C has opened up surface-connected voids in the graphite. Even here, however, the braze is sound. No difference was observed between the braze quality of this sample, the as-polished sample, and the sample vacuum annealed at 1300°C for ½ hour.

Considerable progress was made on the graded transition joint for minimizing damaging thermal strain in joints of graphite to Hastelloy N. The conceptual design, presented in detail in the last semiannual report, uses a series of nickel-matrix tungsten dispersions for spanning the large gap in thermal expansion between graphite and Hastelloy N. In addition, it incorporates premium grades of graphite or graphite-carbide composites to reduce the dimensional instability associated with.

Irradiation of nuclear graphite. The exploration of heavy-metal compositions for the alloy portion of this joint has been completed. Acceptable brazing procedures for joining segments were developed, and a number of composite joints were fabricated and tested.

We investigated several groups of tungsten- and molybdenum-based alloys and found that tungsten with nickel and iron additives at a 7/3 ratio gave far superior fabrication characteristics. This can be seen by the data in Table 21. 1. We desired alloys that liquid-phase sintered to a microstructure having a ductile nickel alloy phase completely enveloping the otherwise fragile heavy-metal grains. The evaluation of cold rollability reflects on the general ability of the alloy to be fabricated and its ability to take thermal strain.

Tungsten alloys No. 1 and No. 2 (Table 21. 1) are familiar compositions. Of these and their molybdenum counterparts (alloys No. 3 through 5), the 90W-7Ni-3Fe (wt%) composition gave distinctly superior results. Alloys No. 6 through 11 show the characteristics of the tungsten-containing material as a function of increasing additive or matrix content and demonstrate its good fabrication qualities over a range of compositions applicable to composite joints.

Various ternary and quaternary compositions based on molybdenum were explored since neutron displacement damage will anneal at a lower temperature in molybdenum than in tungsten. Thus, alloys with Ni-Pt, Ni-Pd, and Cu-Pd as binary additives (Nos. 12 to 14) and Ni-Cu-Pd, Ni-Fe-Cu, and W-Ni-Fe as ternary additives (Nos. ).

The analysis of the behavior of the tungsten-bearing alloys (alloys Nos. 27 to 32) was somewhat surprising, as it had been considered that brittle intermetallic phases, such as the NiMo compound present in the matrix of alloy No. 3, were chiefly responsible for poor deformability in these materials. A more important factor is now believed to be a closeness in hardness (resistance to deformation) between the matrix and heavy-metal (alloys Nos. 27 to 32). The validity of this consideration is being examined.

The molybdenum alloys with W-Ni-Fe (Nos. 27) additives show adequate capacity for deformation but are marginal or unacceptable because of their "compact shaping characteristics" (see Table 21. 1). This refers to the external physical qualities of fabricated compacts and the ability to sinter those of high matrix content without a tendency toward globbing. The W-Ni-Fe alloys must be rated very good with respect to the globbing tendency, while the Mo-W-Ni-Fe alloys are very poor.

Several preliminary composite joints of the description illustrated in 3 were fabricated for testing. Although the basic concept includes an irradiation-resistant graphite segment, a nuclear grade was substituted for these experiments since none of the former was available at the time. The favorable distribution of expansion coefficients of the individual segments of this joint in relation to those for graphite and Hastelloy N can be seen in 4; this correlates composition with coefficient of expansion.

Together in a vacuum under a light load, bonding of the heavy-metal alloys was not difficult, since copper wets them and is soluble in their matrices. Bonding of graphite, on the other hand, was difficult. Brazing materials covered in the literature.

Examined. The metallizing is effected by subjecting the graphite surfaces to be joined to gaseous products of a graphite-Cr, O, reduction reaction, conducted under a low vacuum at 1400°C. Four room-temperature tensile tests were conducted on a nuclear grade of graphite bonded by this method, using a conical bond interface.

The main work presently underway is concerned with minimizing the number of segments in a joint and reducing cost. We shall do this by taking as large a step in the coefficient of expansion as practical in the graphite portion of the joint, since graphite has a very low modulus of elasticity—about two orders below that for the heavy metals. This would require fewer heavy-metal alloy segments. This idea appears good since the graphite materials of the highest irradiation stability generally have the highest expansion coefficients, and thus transitions in dimensional stability and thermal coefficient can be imparted simultaneously.

Recent coefficient of expansion determinations on the irradiation-resistant Poco graphite gave a joints incorporating Poco graphite and 80% and 60% W heavy-metal alloys are being prepared for test. The relative magnitudes of the coefficients of the materials of construction are shown graphically in Fig. 4. Observe that at the junction between the graphite and heavy-metal alloy, where concern for cracking is greatest, joining is made on a basis of equal expansion coefficient. The joint actually reduces to two transition segments if we wish to join Hastelloy N to a graphite having a coefficient of thermal expansion as high as.

We made improvements to the ultrasonic pulse-echo technique for evaluation of tubular graphite-to-metal brazed joints. A reference standard was prepared in an attempt to simulate areas of bond and non-bond. This new standard allowed better assurance of more quantitative results and better reproducibility. The technique is currently applicable only to the first inch of the tapered brazed joint since this has the greater metal thickness. Above this point, the molybdenum shell wall becomes prohibitively thin for resolution.

A graphite-to-molybdenum joint was brazed with Ni-Pd-Cr for study. The joint was brazed at a temperature where the Ni-Pd-Cr would not flow well in order to obtain a defective joint for study. A plan view recording of a section of the standard is shown in Fig. 5a. The black areas represent nonbond, and the light area is due to a piece of tape placed on the standard to simulate a bonded area. The sample was run with the same gain, and the recording shown in Fig. 5b was obtained. The white areas indicate bond and show that only about 30% of the joint was brazed.

In order to make fusion welds (no filler metal added) on the irradiated tensile specimens, it was necessary to design a special welding fixture which could be operated remotely in a hot cell. We aimed for a reasonable assurance of good penetration (high percentage of cross-section of e can be seen). The fixture consists of a rigid stand, a motor-driven chuck, a specimen support, and a TIG welding torch. The upper support has an internal curved surface that contacts the fillet radius of the tensile sample and keeps the sample aligned during welding. The torch was connected to a programmed welding power supply located outside the hot cell. The welding conditions were adjusted to obtain penetration of about 75% of the sample cross-section.

The fixture described in the previous section was used to make fusion passes in the gauge portion of several of our surveillance samples. Our test specimens are only 0.125 inches in diameter, and the welding parameters that we used fused about 75% of the cross-section.

Case and very small amounts of residual salt in the strength of the weld affect the location of the other case. We used 240-grit emery paper and fractured at 25°C to the weld metal, with acetone cleaning to remove both contaminants, resulting in slightly lower strain at fracture.

We welded about 25 unirradiated samples before welding the irradiated samples, and 100% of the welds were sound by visual examination. The bad welds occurred rather randomly among the two groups of samples. We suspected that much of the difficulty occurred in the weld metal.

At 650°C, the weld metal is weaker, and the fracture occurs in the weld metal at only about half the strain normally associated with fractures in the base metal. Stress-relieving for 8 hours at 871°C improves the fracture strain to where it is comparable with that of the base.

Unirradiated samples are followed, with the exception that the tendency to fail in the base metal is much higher for the irradiated samples. This is very likely associated with the relative toughness of the weld metal and base metal for the two cases. In unirradiated materials, the weld metal is the weaker, and in irradiated materials, the weld metal is probably superior since it has been melted, and the influences of irradiation have been removed. Two of the irradiated samples tested at 25°C failed in the weld metal at low strains, and it is likely that the welds in these samples were defective. The microstructure of a sample welded and tested at 650°C is shown in Figure 2.

The metal strained considerably. The porosity associated with the weld is a striking feature. Some voids are formed along the carbide stringers, and our previous work has shown that these carbide stringers do melt at a lower temperature than the base metal. Much of the porosity is located at the fusion line and within the weld metal.

Thus, we have been able to make satisfactory welds in Hastelloy N that has been irradiated and exposed to fluoride salts. There is an added degree of difficulty in making welds in these materials, probably associated with cleanliness. The sound welds have properties as good as the irradiated base metal, if not better. These welds have been made with low heat input and low restraint, and more difficulty may be encountered with large section sizes.

The Chemical Technology Division has designed and constructed a vessel for distilling molten salts to remove fission products. The still is constructed of Hastelloy N and operates at a maximum temperature of 1000°C. This temperature is quite high for Hastelloy N, and we were concerned over whether the corrosion rate would be too high. We devised a surveillance program that would allow us to follow the corrosion of the Hastelloy N and to examine the compatibility of several other potential structural materials. After the still operated for over 4300 hours, we removed the surveillance samples for examination.

We wired small coupons into two like sets of stringers and mounted them on a Hastelloy N support fixture tack welded to the Hastelloy N dip line of the vacuum distillation unit, as shown in Fig. 3a. The arrangement and position of each stringer were such that specimens of each material were in vapor and liquid zones, with a Hastelloy.

A visual check of the samples in the liquid region showed that the Hastelloy N and Alloy 82 were etched slightly, and the surface of the Mo-TZM was unaltered. The Haynes Alloy No. 25 was severely attacked and broke easily. The graphite specimens were missing. The poor performance of the graphite was caused by air leakage into the system when a heater failure burned a hole in the argon inlet line to the condenser. An indeterminate amount of air was in the system for about 500 hours with the temperature at 700°C. Several small crystalline metallic deposits were found at random on the surfaces of samples.

The specimens in the vapor region had a thin gray to black film, possibly due to the period of operation with air present. The Hastelloy N, alloy 82, and Mo-TZM seemed to be in good physical condition. The Haynes alloy No. 25 had enlarged, and the graphite samples were.

We have sectioned the Hastelloy N samples for metallographic examination. There was an intergranular attack to a depth of 4 mils on the vapor-zone specimen and an intergranular and transgranular attack to a depth of 2 mils in the liquid-zone specimen. In general, the attack in the liquid zone was scattered 1-mil-deep attack, with some oxide on the surfaces and in the voids, similar to that shown in Figure 5a. The Hastelloy N specimen spanning the vapor-liquid interface showed the same conditions, except that the transition from the liquid to the vapor region was gradual, and the attack in the vapor zone was only 2 mils. The absence of aggravated attack at the liquid-vapor interface and the shallow corrosion depths in the liquid and vapor zones indicate that it is reasonable to use the Hastelloy N vacuum still.

After about 120 hours of high-temperature operation, a partial plug formed in the feed line to the molten-salt distillation vessel. A section of the plugged line was removed for detailed examination. The plug, shown in Fig. 6, is comprised of small metallic particles. Annealing twins are visible at high magnification and thus indicate that the material has an fcc crystal structure.

Microprobe scans were made across some of the individual particles for nickel, iron, chromium, and molybdenum, the principal alloying elements in Hastelloy N. The particles were very inhomogeneous; the nickel content ranged from 90 to 98%, and the iron content from 4 to 12%. Chromium and molybdenum were not detected (<1%). Bulk analysis of the material indicated that aluminum, tin, and copper might be present, so scans were also made for these elements. These elements were not detected, indicating that their respective concentrations were <1%.

Up to 700°C, "We presently feel that cermets (specifically, metal-bonded carbides) offer the most potential for this application and currently have a small evaluation program. The cheapest way of using these materials is to plasma spray the bearing or valve surfaces with a thin layer of the cermet. " The surfaces can be ground to produce the desired surface finish.

We are presently evaluating four coatings that have been applied to small Hastelloy N cylinders. The nominal composition and other pertinent details are given in Table 22.3. The coatings are about 3 mils thick and were ground to obtain a good surface finish. The coating operation was handled by Mechanical Technology, Inc. (MTI), although some of the actual coating work was contracted to other vendors. We plan to evaluate the respective potential of each coating by thermal cycling and compatibility studies.

Before these studies were begun, we determined the species present by X-ray diffraction, and the results of these studies are summarized in Table 22. 3. In the two cases where cobalt was used as the bonding agent, a carbide of cobalt, Co₃C, was detected, but elemental cobalt was not seen. The nickel binder in LW-5 was not detected. Composition inhomogeneities and/or strains were evident in the diffraction pattern from each of the deposits. These specimens will be reexamined following the thermal cycle and compatibility experiments. Dimensional variations due to changes in crystal structure during heating are quite possible in such.

Chemical analysis showed that chromium, iron, manganese, and silicon were severely leached from the alloy. The corroded end of the probe was found to be highly ferromagnetic, which was understandable in the light of a later chemical analysis of small crystals comprising the plug.

Analogy, as a first approximation, can be applied to stainless steel. Thus, a weight loss of 175 mg/cm² of material in 5000 hr is indicated for type 304 stainless steel in fluoroborate salt. Corrosion of this magnitude is excessive but considerably less than what was experienced by them.

There are at least three possible explanations for the observed high rate of attack: (1) the salt was generally contaminated; (2) oxidizing impurities were introduced locally at the probe due to a leak; and (3) the probe was attacked selectively since it was the least noble part exposed to a large volume of salt in an Inconel system. The last mechanism is probably responsible for the observed dissolution of an iron sample capsule in the MSRE, where Hastelloy N is the principal metallic material. We know of no reasonable way of distinguishing between these possibilities.

Previous studies have shown that heat transfer can be enhanced in condensers by using tubing with roughened or fluted surfaces. The roughened surface promotes turbulence and increases the overall heat transfer coefficient. There is a great incentive for improving the heat transfer by this technique in molten-salt systems since this reduces the quantity of uranium that is outside the core in heat exchangers.

We noted that the stringers of M, C carbides cracked during fabrication, and thermal fatigue tests would be needed to determine whether these cracks propagate during service. However, the modified Hastelloy N presently under study does not have these stringers and should present no problems in this regard.

This has been a period of fulfillment for several projects in our program. The first fuel charge of the MSRE was processed for the recovery of the 235 by fluorination in an operation characterized by simplicity and predictable performance. The product uranium was decontaminated sufficiently to allow manual manipulation of the sodium fluoride beds on which it was accumulated, and the carrier salt was purified for reuse in the second phase of the reactor operation. We successfully prepared a °3U charge, in the form of a TLiF-33UF eutectic salt, for refueling the MSRE; it is now packaged in capsules and cans, ready for insertion into the reactor. This preparation proceeded rapidly and with little difficulty after some revisions in the chemical flowsheet were made. Our nonradioactive testing of the 48-liter molten-salt still has been concluded.

Our work on contactor development continues to be encouraging. Facilities for performing engineering studies on reductive extraction have been designed, and installation is in progress. Operations with salt and bismuth are scheduled to begin during the next few months. The method for separating rare earths from thorium by reductive extraction is still in the developmental phases. Separation factors in the proposed reactor salt system appear to be somewhat low (between 1 and 3); therefore, it may be necessary to adjust the concentration of the carrier salt to attain separation factors that will be sufficiently high to make this operation feasible.

Development of the reductive extraction method for the processing of single-fluid molten-salt breeder reactor fuels has been continued. The process being evaluated involves the selective extraction of uranium, protactinium, and rare earths from the molten salt into liquid bismuth that contains a dissolved reductant such as thorium. In order to evaluate the feasibility of large-scale engineering application of this method, the equilibrium distribution of the various components between the two phases must be known. The distribution of component M can be expressed as a distribution coefficient.

During the early part of this reporting period, an alpha facility was established for use in small-scale studies of the behavior of protactinium in reductive extraction systems. The distribution of protactinium between a typical single-fluid mole percentage and liquid bismuth has been established at 600°C.

BeF2, ThF4, salt. The salt, contained in a degassed graphite crucible, was treated with HF-H2 to remove oxide impurities and finally was treated with argon to strip out residual HF and hydrogen. The salt was frozen, and the resulting ingot was transferred under argon to the mild-steel crucible containing the bismuth. After the two-phase system had been heated to the desired temperature under argon, pieces of Li-Bi alloy (about 7 at. % Li) were added periodically to increase the reductant concentration in the metal phase. Filtered samples of both phases were taken either 4 or 24 hr after addition of the alloy.

Although the technique outlined above gave reliable values for the distribution coefficients, material balances for protactinium, uranium, and thorium were undesirably low. The main cause of the low balances was found to be oxidation of these active metals by oxidants present in the supposedly high-purity argon. This problem was eliminated by passing the argon through two traps filled with uranium turnings. The first trap was held at 600°C, and the second trap was held at 260°C. Experiments made after this modification were conducted in a system in which the components that contacted the salt and bismuth (crucible, sparge tubes, thermowells, etc. ) were all fabricated from molybdenum. In addition, being able to hydrofluorinate the two-phase system in molybdenum made it possible to conduct several experiments in sequence in the same apparatus, using only one initial charge.

The slope of the line is 4, showing that the protactinium species in the salt phase was tetravalent. These data yield a value of 0.579 V for AE, the difference in half-cell reduction potentials as defined by Moulton. This value, when compared with previously reported values for uranium and thorium, confirms earlier indications.

Protactinium is present in the metal phase by oxidants present in the argon. Experiment PES was conducted at 600°C in molybdenum using argon that had been passed through traps filled with uranium turnings, with the objective of demonstrating that.

Protactinium could be held in bismuth at a significant concentration if the system was practically free of oxidants. In this experiment, UF4 and PaF, that originally were present in the salt, reduced by addition of crystal-bar thorium to the system. The amount of thorium added was sufficient to reduce all of the UF4, and about 95% of the PaF. The resulting metal phase contained about 5000 ppm U, 750 ppm Th, and 70 ppm Pa. The protactinium concentration in the salt was about 10 ppm. The system remained practically unchanged for 128 hr (Table 23. 1). The results of this experiment provide conclusive proof that protactinium can be maintained in solution with bismuth in a molybdenum container and that good material balances can be maintained if oxidants are excluded from the.

The feasibility of the proposed protactinium recovery process has been subjected to question because it had not been demonstrated that protactinium was sufficiently soluble in bismuth, U-Bi, and Th-Bi solutions for process application. A calculation of the concentration profiles expected in a reductive extraction contactor indicated that the solubility of protactinium in bismuth had to be at least as high as that of thorium and that protactinium had to be soluble to about 1000 wt ppm when the concentrations of uranium or thorium in the bismuth were about 1000 wt ppm if the desired process conditions were to be attained.

Experiment PE7 was conducted in an attempt to demonstrate that the desired process conditions could be met. Using molybdenum apparatus, about 100 mg of Pa was dissolved (as PaF6) in 100 g of LiF-BeF2 (66-34 mole %) by hydrofluorination in the presence of 50 g of bismuth. After hydrofluorination, residual HF and hydrogen were removed from the salt by stripping with pure argon. With the system at 600°C, crystal-bar thorium was added to the metal phase to reduce some of the PaF6 and effect protactinium transfer to the metal phase. A sample of the metal phase taken 4 hr after the addition of thorium analyzed 1124 wt ppm protactinium and 1400 wt ppm thorium (Table 23. 2).

Estimated to be about 4500 wt ppm. At the time of this writing, analysis of all samples from experiment PE7 was incomplete. However, based on those available and on estimates from gamma counting of the samples, the protactinium balance was practically 100% throughout the 7. 3-day period.

The results obtained so far from experiment PE7 show that the solubility of protactinium in bismuth is at least as high as the thorium solubility in the temperature range of interest. In addition, the mutual solubility of thorium and protactinium (at least 1000 wt ppm of each) is adequately high for process application.

In a mild steel crucible under argon, lithium (as Li-Bi alloy) was added to the bismuth in small increments, and the distribution of the various components between the two phases was determined. Under these experimental conditions, enough ThF could be reduced to produce a metal phase that was saturated with thorium without changing the ThF4 concentration in the salt detectably. The separation factors determined at Dae will be denoted by a, although it should be emphasized that these are not necessarily the maximum separation factors attainable.

The proposed method for removing protactinium and fission products from a single-fluid molten salt breeder reactor (or from the blanket salt of two-fluid reactors) involves reductive extraction using liquid bismuth containing lithium and thorium reductants. Equipment is needed to efficiently contact streams of salt and bismuth. The properties of these fluids are very different from those of aqueous and organic fluids with which most experience with liquid-liquid extraction equipment has been obtained. For instance, the difference between the densities of the salt and metal phases is 0.2 g/ml. Similarly, the interfacial tension between bismuth and molten salt could be as much as a factor of 10 greater than that usually seen.

Since the correlations used to design liquid-liquid extraction systems are based on conditions far removed from those of current interest, experimental data from systems similar to the molten-salt—bismuth system are needed. Because experiments with bismuth and molten salt are difficult, a mercury-water system will be used initially to provide the hydrodynamic data necessary to allow intelligent selection of contactor types to test with the process fluids. This simulated system will provide quantitative data on flooding rates, pressure drop, holdup, and backmixing, as well as qualitative information on flow patterns and drop size. Mass transfer measurements are also possible in a simulated system; however, they are not in progress.

Packed with a gin, Berl saddles using water and Woods metal, their observed flooding rates were not adequately predicted by conventional correlations. Actually, when the correlations were extrapolated to the required conditions, the predicted results were so different that it was considered a coincidence when a predicted flooding rate fell near the experimental value.

The experiments in this study are carried out in a 1-in. ID, 2-ft-long glass column. Mercury is circulated between the column and a hold tank by a diaphragm pump containing tantalum check valves. Distilled water is circulated through the column by a small centrifugal pump. Ball valves are located at each end of the 1-in. column and allow flow to and from the column to be stopped instantly for holdup measurements. Each end of the column also contains a section of 2-in. pipe. These sections, which are partially packed with the packing material of interest, allow lower velocities for coalescence as well as provide space for the inlet and outlet lines.

Thus far, we have tested Teflon Raschig rings (0. 5 in. OD) and a solid cylindrical packing. The diameter should be about twice as large to avoid wall effects with 4-in. packing, but we are, at present, restricted to the smaller diameter because of the limited capacity of the mercury pump. Teflon and polyethylene will be chosen for most packing materials because they are not wet by either phase, and neither bismuth nor the molten fluoride salt is expected to wet the material chosen for the process contactor.

Travels downward in channels. This type of behavior is typical for all flow rates tested with this packing. Figure 24. 2 is a photograph of the column with Yy-in. Raschig rings. This small increase in packing diameter causes a dramatic change in the behavior of the dispersed metal phase. The metal moves down the column in the form of small droplets which seldom coalesce and remain intact for 2; Mercury-Water Column Operated with Yin. Considerable distances down the column. This Polyethylene Raschig Rings.

Flow behavior is typical of all measurements made with the Yin. Raschig rings or the Yin. solid cylinder packing. However, as the flow rates approach flooding conditions, some "channel flow" begins to occur. The dispersed or droplet flow is more desirable, since it provides a significantly greater interfacial area than "channel flow. " Thus, it may be desirable to operate the salt-metal columns with approximately Yin. or larger packing. Raschig rings and Yin. solid cylinders; flooding occurred at approximately the same conditions. At equal (volumetric) flow rates, flooding occurred when the superficial velocity of each phase reached approximately 90 ft/hr or 650 gal ft-hr-4. We investigated flooding rates for a range of flow ratios. The flooding curves could.

Efforts are also being made to correlate holdup, pressure drop, and flooding rates with all of the systems studied. The simulated system should provide methods for interpreting and understanding the pressure drop measurements, which will be made with salt-metal contactors. In addition, it should provide initial estimates of how such contactors.

Equipment has been designed and fabricated for semi-continuous engineering experiments on reductive extraction. Mass transfer between molten salt and bismuth streams will be observed under various flow conditions. Pressure drop through the column can also be measured, and it may be possible to correlate mass transfer performance with hydrodynamic conditions—flooding, holdup, specific interfacial area, etc. —which may be inferred from work underway using a mercury-water system. The first experiments are planned for the last quarter of 1968 and will involve the transfer of uranium from a salt to a metal stream.

Molten salt and liquid bismuth will be contacted countercurrently in a packed column 0.82 in. ID x 2 ft long filled with %-in. right circular cylinders of molybdenum. Three other columns having similar dimensions—one containing %-in. cylindrical packing, one with segmental baffles at 4-in. spacing, and one empty column—are also available for testing. Approximately 15-liter batches of molten salt and bismuth will be charged initially to a graphite crucible in the treatment vessel.

The experimental equipment, described previously, consisted of a 5-in. diameter, 8-ft high column fabricated from schedule-40 nickel pipe. An internal heat source consisting of three Calrod heaters contained in a ½-in. diameter schedule-40 pipe was used to simulate a volume heat source in the molten salt. The salt mixture was 66-34 mole % LiF-ZrF2, which has a liquidus temperature of 595°C and a phase diagram similar to the LiF-BeF2 system. Since the principal objective of the work was to demonstrate that a uniform layer of frozen salt could be established and maintained at expected heat generation rates, we chose to substitute argon for fluorine, thereby simplifying the.

For the final set of experiments, the insulation was stripped from the upper test section, and the air cooling coils were removed to permit heat loss by radiation and natural convection. The primary purpose was to obtain more nearly uniform surface temperature and frozen salt thickness throughout the test section.

As a means of confirming the frozen salt thickness indicated by the internal thermocouples, the molten salt phase in a few selected experiments was quickly drained from the column after a period of steady-state operation. Radiographs of the column were then made; one of these shows that over the 3. 5-in. elevation change covered by the array of internal thermocouples, the salt thickness decreased from 0. 80 to 0. 65. The plane of the nominal 1-in. This method is illustrated in Fig. 2 for the same experiment and is based on the temperature-position relationship for the classical case of purely radial flow of heat to the outer surface of a thick-walled cylinder. Here, the cylinder was the frozen salt layer itself; the metal wall constituted a negligible resistance to heat flow because of its much higher coefficient of thermal conductivity. The most consistent interpretation of the experimental data was obtained by using only two thermocouples — the internal thermocouple located 0. 66 in. from the metal wall, and the adjacent wall thermocouple — to locate the interface.

The approximately 1-hour period required to drain molten salt from the column after the Calrod heaters were turned off. The low temperature caused by a porous metal deposit, which limited the salt flow rate during the latter runs to approximately 3 liters/hr. The outer bank was the layer of frozen salt that existed at a steady state.

Column, thickness of frozen salt = 0.80 in. by the preferred method of extrapolating from a surface temperature through temperature of adjacent thermocouple to 580 at 0.8 in. liquidus temperature (experiment 23).

Essentially the same procedure was used in each tun. Molten salt was charged to the feed tank at 600°C from a heated storage vessel. After the storage vessel was disconnected, the still pot was heated to 900 to 950°C, and the system pressure was reduced to 5 mm Hg. The feed tank was pressurized to about 0. 5 atm to force salt into the liquid level in the still pot. The system was switched to automatic control, and salt was fed to the still pot in this mode at a rate slightly greater than the vaporization rate.

To a given point, the valve then remained closed until the salt dropped to another set point. After about one still volume had been processed, the temperature of the still was raised to the desired operating point (approximately 1000°C). When the desired quantity of salt had been distilled, distillation was stopped by increasing the condenser pressure to 5 mm Hg.

During each run, distillation rates were determined by measuring the rate of rise of the condensate level in the receiver. The steady-state measurements for each run and the operating conditions under which they were determined are shown in Table 27. 1.

Concentration polarization in the still pot or entrainment of liquid droplets from the still pot could seriously limit the separation of the slightly volatile LnF2 from the more volatile LiF and BeF2. The extent of polarization or entrainment was determined by analyzing condensate samples taken during the course of a run for NdF3. The ratio of NdF3 concentration in the condensate to the average NdF3 concentration in the still, denoted by R, should be constant and should approximate the relative volatility of NdF3 with respect to LiF.

In the first run in which NdF was included in the feed salt, R varied (randomly) between 1.4 x 10-4 and 3.5 x 10-4 for about 2.5 still pot volumes of collected condensate. This value is comparable to the measured relative volatility of NdF, which is 1.4 x 10^7. In later runs (MSS-C-5 and MSS-C-6), the values of R were as high as 5.5 x 10-2. However, it is believed that the high values.

The results were due to samples contaminated by flush salt from previous runs remaining on the condenser walls and in the sample reservoir. Neither concentration polarization nor entrainment was evident in the run from which the data are considered.

Two difficulties were encountered: (1) condensed ZrF and unidentified molybdenum compounds in the vacuum line completely restricted flow on two occasions; and (2) a deposition of nickel and iron in the salt feed line to the still almost stopped the flow after the first two runs and caused a noticeable restriction in the replacement feed line after the fourth run.

The major metallic constituents of the plugs in the vacuum line were zirconium and molybdenum. The first plug was removed by cutting into the vacuum line; the second plug was broken during the last run by heating the vacuum line to about 950 to 1050°C, thereby redistributing the material. Examination of the vacuum line during the postoperational inspection showed that the free cross-section of the pipe at the point of exit from the receiver was still about 50% of the original cross-section. 4% zirconium and 11%.

The cause for the metal deposition in the salt feed line is not completely understood. Two possible sources of the deposited material are suspended metals and/or dissolved fluorides introduced with the feed salt, and corrosion products. The possibility that system corrosion may have been a factor is suggested by the composition of both of these metals as constituents of Hastelloy N, and of the plug in the vacuum line (high molybdenum content). The extent of corrosion necessary to produce the materials found would be very small and could not have been detected by the wall thickness measurements. Another possible source of corrosion products is the corrosion coupons in the still pot, although no coupon was severely corroded.

The deposition of dissolved fluorides is based on the observation that higher-valence fluorides are, in general, more volatile than lower-valence fluorides of the same element. This condition causes the still pot salt to be reducing in nature with respect to the feed salt and could cause reduction and deposition at the entrance to the still pot.

Post-operational inspection showed the still to be in good condition. Wall thickness measurements over the still pot and over both ends of the condenser showed an average decrease in thickness of only 1. 6 mils. Distances between widely selected points changed by an average of only.

The transpiration method supports possible distillation steps in the processing of single-fluid Molten-Salt Breeder Reactor fuels. The data are summarized in Table 28. 1. In the absence of any information regarding complex molecules in the vapor phase, the partial pressures and the predicted total pressures were calculated by assuming that only monomers existed in the vapor. Association in the vapor (known to occur in the vapor above pure LiF and LiF-BeF systems) would lower both the calculated partial pressures and the predicted total pressures. In all cases, the apparent partial pressure P could be described adequately by a linear equation.

In addition to the systems shown in Table 28. 1, a limited amount of data was obtained with LiF-BeF2-ThF4-solute fluoride systems. Data for the mole % indicate the following relative volatilities with respect to LiF at 1000°C: BeF2 37, ThF4 % yielded relative volatilities of about 100, 0.65, at 1000°C. In an experiment in which CsF and RbF were present in LiF-BeF2-ThF4 (68-20-12 mole %) at concentrations of 0.13.

The MSRE is to be fueled with 33U in 1968. Approximately 39.0 kg of 91.4% enriched 7U as LiF-53UF (73-27 mole %) eutectic salt is required. This material was prepared in cell G of the Thorium Uranium Recycle Facility because of the high 32U content (222 ppm) of the feed material and its associated radiation.

The process and equipment for preparing this concentrate have been described previously. This report describes the cold run using 73°C; changes in the process as a result of the cold run experience, and the production of the enriching concentrate.

The cold run was completed on April 12, 1968, using the one-step high-temperature process. The endpoint of the hydrofluorination step of the process was difficult to determine because our sampling procedure was contributing oxide contamination to the melt. We modified the procedures and some of our equipment so that we would take a dipped sample of the melt for oxide determination and later take filtered samples for the analysis of the corrosion products, primarily iron, nickel, and chromium, after the hydrogen purification of the eutectic.

The cold tun product met the quality criteria established by the MSRE, but the prolonged operation at elevated temperatures, and some of the sample data taken during the run, indicated excessive corrosion of the reaction vessel. Upon completion of the run, the vessel was sectioned, and extensive damage to the nickel liner was found.

Two hundred grams of normal uranium, as UO2, were first reduced by hydrogen sparging and then converted to UF4 by hydrofluorination at temperatures 200 to 400°C lower than in the original flowsheet. This technique was then adopted for the production of the fuel concentrate.

The first production run with the revised process flowsheet began on May 9, 1968. Uranium oxide was treated initially at 500°C with a helium sparge to remove any volatiles and to thoroughly decompose remaining ammonium compounds. The UO2 was then reduced to UO2 over a period of 24 hr by sparging with hydrogen at concentrations from 5 to 100% over the temperature range 400 to 550°C.

The temperatures within the powder bed were monitored throughout the uranium reduction and hydrofluorination by a multi-thermocouple probe inserted along the vertical axis of the reaction vessel. Twelve thermocouples were located at 2-inch intervals along the probe. The progress of the exothermic reactions upward through the bed could very easily be followed by observing them.

The eutectic salt LiF-UF (73-27 mole %) was formed by adding the stoichiometric amount of LiF to the UF55 and then melting and digesting the resulting mixture for 4 hours at 850°C with a sparge of 30% hydrogen in helium. The melt was then cooled to 700°C and purged for 24 hours with a mixture of 20% HF in hydrogen to ensure conversion of any remaining oxides to fluorides. This was followed by hydrogen treatment for 75 to 100 hours to reduce the corrosion product fluorides of nickel.

The process was monitored by measuring the HF evolved with an in-cell titration apparatus. For a 22-kg eutectic salt charge in the 7% gin. -diam reaction vessel, hydrogen and helium, each at the rate of 100 ppm, respectively. The corrosion product concentrations for all production runs are listed in the HF evolution rate during the eutectic purification.

Each of the enrichment capsules contains about 155 g of the eutectic salt or 96 g of uranium. The array consists of three decks of 15 capsules which must be separated, and the excess connecting tubes clipped off. Two 4-in. -diameter holes are then drilled in each capsule: the bottom hole for draining and the top hole for venting. The capsules are then weighed and stored in a six-pack carousel for shipment to the MSRE. They will be lowered, one at a time, into the bowl of the reactor fuel circulating pump where the fuel concentrate is melted out.

The ten shipping containers were fabricated from 2.5-in. -OD type 304L stainless steel tubing of varying lengths, having capacities from 0.5 to 7.0 kg of total uranium. They were assembled into two arrays for filling. One array consisted of four containers, each having a uranium capacity of 7 kg, and the other array consisted of six containers varying in capacity. Assemblies were dismantled, a lifting fixture was attached to each can, and each can was weighed. They will be shipped individually in a shielded cask to the MSRE for loading into the reactor.

Adopted for the preparation of LiF-253UF, eutectic salt was developed to replace the high-temperature, one-step process (found to be intractable in shakedown runs) with the view of avoiding extensive engineering changes in the equipment installed in the 55U production facility. The basis for consideration of a low-temperature process in the 8-in. -OD nickel production reactor was available.

The important factors to be considered in the development of a new process were: (1) avoidance of high-temperature local reaction zones in the 8-in. OD reactor, and (2) addition of 7LiF to the reactor after conversion of the UO2 to UF6 was practically complete. The data in the literature indicated that high-surface-area VO2 could be converted to UF6 in the 400 to 600°C range if the temperature and gas flow rates were carefully controlled.

Above the melting point of LiF (842°C), LiF-UF salt forms the eutectic. The removal of trace oxide impurities from the eutectic salt involves treatment with HF-H at 700°C. Furthermore, the removal of metal impurities such as NiF and some FeF from the melt is achieved through treatment with H at 700°C.

A 2-in. OD by 10-in. high nickel reactor was used to test the low-temperature process concept. A center thermocouple well permitted temperature measurements at any depth in the reacting powder, including the zone near the end of the dip tube, which extended down to within 0. 25 in. of the bottom of the reactor. A gas flow rate of 130 ml/min (STP) was employed in all gas addition steps to simulate the linear velocity (2 std liters/min) in the 8-in. OD reactor. The reactor was charged with 210 g of UO2 that was prepared by decomposition of ammonium diuranate followed by calcination at a maximum temperature of 550°C. The preparation of this material was essentially the same as that for the U3O8 oxide. The bulk density (approximately 1. 02) of the oxide used in the laboratory test was similar to that of the U3O8.

Dilution of hydrogen with helium in the reduction step and of HF with hydrogen in the hydrofluorination step were essential features of the proposed process in order to minimize any temperature excursions. Although the heat of reaction in the hydrofluorination step is almost twice that in.

Slowly raised to 100%, a temperature excursion of about 65°C occurred briefly, but the reaction zone became broader, and the more highly reactive sites disappeared. External wall temperature. The initial HF concentration of 10% (in hydrogen) was raised in the final 5-hour period.

In the third step of the process, 48 g of LiF powder was placed in the reactor on top of the UF, and the temperature was raised to about 875°C (at the bottom of the LiF layer) before eutectic melting was observed. The lack of eutectic formation at the eutectic temperature of 490°C was attributed to the lack of mixing of the LiF and UF and the short time employed.

In conducting the laboratory test of the process, care was taken to observe the behavior of the oxide and fluoride materials in the presence of flowing gases. This allowed us to anticipate, if possible, any problems that might arise in the operation of the 8-inch-OD reactor in the engineering facility.

The gas flow rate of 130 ml/min (STP) was conservatively low since some suspicion existed that 4 std liters/min (twice the linear velocity prevailing in the laboratory test) in the 8-in. -OD reactor had produced some dust entrainment in the cold practice run with the first process flowsheet. During the entire laboratory test, practically no solids (less than 0. 1 g) were entrained from the reactor to the 2-in. -diam Huyck Feltmetal nickel filter (equivalent to FM 235, a 7-y-rated material) placed in the off-gas system.

Tests in glass columns confirmed that the permeation of gas through the test bed, at the chosen flow rate, was uniform; no channeling was noted. The small bed expansion which occurred was correlated with measurements of bed height and pressure drops in order to predict, with some accuracy, the behavior of the 25- to 30-in. depth of powder expected in the 8-in. -OD reactor.

Analysis of the UF after the dry hydrofluorination step showed an oxygen content of 0. 52%. 17% oxygen. The first analysis was considered more accurate; however, due to the uncertainty in integrating the HF utilization over the treatment.

Good control of both the reduction and hydrofluorination steps of the process could be achieved in the 8-in. -OD production reactor if the initial temperature was no higher than 440°C and if the lowest possible reactant gas concentrations were used. The safest procedure would probably be to increase the gas reactant concentration as much as possible before increasing the temperature.

In order to control the process on a large scale, a stack of thermocouples placed near the center line of the 8-inch reactor would be desirable. These thermocouples, spaced at intervals of 2 to 3 inches, would permit observation of movement of the reaction zone upward during processing and of the maximum temperatures produced.

Thermochemical calculations showed that a considerable amount of reaction heat was lost through the reactor side wall in the test of the 2-inch reactor. On a larger scale, however, the thermochemical heat would have to be dissipated mainly in the heating of the gas streams.

The high utilization of hydrogen in the reduction step and of HF in the hydrofluorination step of the laboratory test indicated that nearly quantitative usage of reactant gases could be expected in a scale-up of the process where a deep bed of material would be employed.

The processing of the MSRE fuel salt used for the first phase of MSRE operation is described in the first part of this report. The two objectives have been satisfactorily achieved: recovering the work described in this section was carried out in support of the uranium recovery operation.

A study was made of the interdependence of several factors in the fluorination step in an effort to anticipate the effect of removing about 220 kg of uranium from 4500 kg of carrier salt. Particular attention was given to determination of the uranium valence in the salt as fluorine gas was introduced and to the relationship of the uranium valence to helium sparging, temperature, and corrosion. Two studies were made of the behavior of UF6 (generated in sparging the melt with fluorine) in the presence of NaF. In the step following fluorination of the MSRE salt, an NaF bed at 400°C was used for decontaminating the gaseous UF6 from volatile fission products (principally ruthenium and niobium) and chromium. Retention of UF6 on NaF at 400°C is high (by decomposition into a UF6 complex) in the absence of free fluorine. Tests were made at different F2/UF6 ratios to determine whether this causes serious problems in MSRE processing and to explore the possibility of the existence of some type of equilibrium. In the other NaF study, the sorption of UF6 on NaF in the range 25 to 100°C was examined, particularly with respect to use of lower high-surface-area NaF prepared by two distinctly.

The disposal of waste gaseous fluorine from MSRE processing was also found to be a problem area in the startup operation of the installed facility. The SO method for the disposal of fluorine (by the formation of SOF) was found to be infeasible under the prevailing conditions. An aqueous scrub of KOH-KI-K3B6O10 was developed as an alternative method for fluorine disposal in the MSRE processing plant.

A 1-inch nickel rod inserted through a tee at the top of the reactor. The valence of uranium in the salt samples was calculated from separate determinations of the U(IV) and U(VI) concentration. The tests were made with 340 g of LiF-BeF2-ZrF4-UF4 (63-32-5-0. 8 mole %); the salt depth was about 3 inches.

A test at 500°C with pure fluorine illustrated the relationship between the degree of uranium volatilization and the uranium valence in the salt. 1. At 500°C, there was an extensive evolution of UF6 as the valence increased from 4 to 5. The valence continued to increase (from 5 toward 6) as the remaining part of the uranium volatilized.

In another test at a lower temperature (450°C), the valence plot shows a definite inflection at about the value of five (0. 2). In this test, the fluorine flow was stopped, and helium sparging was started after 1 hr to determine whether helium sparging or corrosion would lead to a rapid decrease of the uranium valence from 5 to 4. Such a decrease might be expected from one of the two.

Surprisingly, in the 1. 5-hr helium sparging period, there was no significant effect on the valence. When fluorine flow was resumed, the same rapid UF evolution and valence increase occurred as in the test at 500°C. However, it was clear that the valence plot of the 450°C data would have had a much larger inflection, even in the absence of a helium sparge period, than the plot of the 500°C.

The depth of salt in the MSRE fluorination reactor (5 to 6 ft) will likely result in the conversion of all of the uranium to the U(V) species before any significant UF6 volatilization takes place. The results, however, do not lead to any conclusion about fluorine utilization. The latter might be more critically dependent on fluorination temperature than on the depth of salt.

Interruption of the fluorination procedure in MSRE processing for the changing of NaF sorption beds (as they become loaded with UF) should not lead to any difficulty in resuming fluorine gas flow. Volatilization of UF should resume almost immediately after such an interruption due to the stability of the U(V) species during the shutdown period. During this period, however, it would probably be best to avoid extensive sparging with helium in order to minimize the evolution of UF.

The stability of the U(V) species is of particular interest to the corrosion picture. The dotted line in Fig. 2 represents the rate of valence change expected if the corrosion reaction should occur at a rate equivalent to 0.67 mil/hr. The fact that the valence did not decrease suggests that corrosion will not be a problem during the shutdown periods required for the changing of sorption beds. Possibly, total corrosion during the processing of MSRE fuel will be less than expected if the wall of the reactor is in contact with salt containing only U(V); that is, corrosion should be high only in the central salt volume where UF6 is “boiling out as it is formed and where the valence of the uranium possibly becomes much greater than 5. The latter applies to the boundary salt layer surrounding the F-UF6 gas that rises through the salt.

At 400°C, a NaF trap is utilized to remove volatile fission product fluorides (primarily RuF and NbF). Throughout this processing phase, it is crucial to maintain a certain amount of free fluorine gas in the stream to avoid significant uranium loss to NaF through the disproportionate reaction of UF6 to nonvolatile UF4. Given the potentially high consumption of fluorine at the commencement of fluorination, concerns arose regarding the adequacy of fluorine availability to prevent disproportionation and uranium depletion. Consequently, a study was initiated to assess the validity of an equilibrium state for the reaction UF6 + NaF + F2 = UF4 + NaF.

The various F2-UF4 mixtures used in the study were produced by equilibration in a nickel reservoir vessel (250-ml volume) containing about 100 g of UF4 at 54°C (Pus = 660 mm Hg), with the appropriate pre-calibrated mixtures of fluorine and nitrogen. (The temperature of the UF4 reservoir was held constant to +0. 5°C by means of a carefully controlled water bath. ) By adjusting the initial F2/N2 ratio, mixtures with F2 concentrations ranging from 11 to 0.3 vol% at atmospheric pressure were obtained. Each mixture was allowed to pass through a 10-g bed of NaF (12-20 mesh) at 400°C for 20 min. Unreacted UF4 passing through the bed was recovered on a backup trap of NaF.

In the first three of a series of six tests, the fluorine concentrations in the gas mixture were 11, 5.5, and 2.1 vol% respectively. Subsequent coulometric analyses of the beds for uranium yielded calculated values for equilibrium constants of 3.8 x 10^5, 3.3 x 10^5, and 4.2 x 10^0 respectively. The equilibrium value, K, was calculated by means of the equation.

In which V, y is the mole fraction of uranium present in the NaF; it was assumed that the activity of NaF was unity. The close correspondence of these values indicated that equilibrium conditions were obtained. In run 5, the UF6 reservoir temperature was raised to 55. 5°C (Pur = 720 mm) to eliminate the need for a low fluorine flow rate at low fluorine concentrations. 3 vol% was achieved. The calculated equilibrium constant was 1.3 x 10^6.

When UF₂ was passed through a similar 400°C NaF bed in a test with no fluorine present (run 6), the amount retained as a result of disproportionation was somewhat lower than those values obtained at higher F₂ concentrations. This is where 0.3 vol% F₂ was present in the stream, demonstrating the necessity of having at least 0. 3 vol% F₂ present during the decontamination step of the process.

Some uncertainty existed with regard to the correct temperature and type of NaF to be used for recovering UF in the MSRE processing facility. This uncertainty arose partially from the results of one engineering test in the MSRE facility, in which it was observed that MoF had not attained equilibrium with sorption beds containing low-surface-area NaF at about 35 to 45°C.

Two grades of porous NaF are available. A low surface-area product is prepared from NaF powder by pelletizing with water, drying, and finally fluorinating at 250 to 350°C. It is characterized by a surface area of 0.07 m²/g and a void fraction of 0.28.

A comparative study of UF sorption at different temperatures was therefore undertaken with the two types of material. A series of six tests with low-surface-area material in the range of 25 to 100°C clearly showed that temperature had a large effect.

The sorption tests were conducted by passing a mixture of 15 mol % UF2 and 85 mol % F2 through a 5 g test bed for 3 min. The sorption test trap was maintained at a constant temperature in a water bath, and a 5 g backup NaF trap was held at 100°C for the sorption of UF2 passing through the test material. Both traps were quartz U-tubes (8. 5 mm ID) specially designed for visibility so that the yellow UF2·2NaF complex could be observed. The traps were filled with sieved material: -8 to +20 mesh for the low-surface-area NaF and -12 to +20 mesh for the high-surface-area material. The F2-UF2 gas mixture was prepared by passing F2 through a UF2 reservoir held at 24°C in a constant-temperature bath.

A semilogarithmic plot of the low-surface-area sorption data was surprisingly linear through four points. This indicated that the process was possibly diffusion-controlled (based on an apparent activation energy of only 4. 6 kcal per mole of UF).

The flow rate was 85 ml/min (STP); the linear velocity was 4.9 fpm. A carrier gas flow rate of 30 std liters/min in the MSRE facility would yield a velocity of 2.4 fpm. While the factor of 2 between the two cases might be significant, it appears improbable that the difference in sorption behavior.

The MSRE facility, for use with such a solution, only required a few piping changes. Laboratory tests were conducted to study selected features of the process that might be important in the operation of the MSRE facility. Some tests were conducted as a result of effects seen in cold practice runs carried out in the MSRE. Observations were made on the amount of corrosion to be expected, the effect of helium dilution of the fluorine, the formation and character of precipitates, and the permissible fraction of the solution capacity that should be used. Most of the work was carried out with a 2M KOH—0. 33 M KI solution. Later, this was modified to include a 0. 2M K3B3O3 to provide neutron poisoning. The handling of mists and smoke in the outlet stream of the scrubber represented another problem area that was investigated in the laboratory.

Local acidic conditions formed in a thin film of liquid that wets the inside wall of the tip; a feathering effect was therefore usually observed. Corrosion of either Inconel or Monel led to the formation of a gelatinous precipitate (hydrated metal oxides), which usually was slow in settling out of solution. From observations of this precipitate, corrosion in solutions used to 50% capacity appeared to be much less than in solutions used. There was little evidence of this type of plugging with ½- or ¾-in. -OD dip tubes.

Use of a maximum fluorine concentration of 50% in helium was recommended for the MSRE facility due to observations of intermittent flames and small violent pressure oscillations at the end of dip tubes when pure F2 was used. It seemed likely that corrosion would be greater under these conditions.

The oxidizing power of F₂ leads, in addition to the evolution of O₂, to the formation of potassium iodate (KIO₃). Copious quantities of this material were found to precipitate at 80% saturation. At 50% saturation, its precipitation was only faintly noticeable. X-ray diffraction and chemical analyses were used to identify the material, which is produced in a rather pure form except for the presence of corrosion products.

In a 2M KOH - 0.33 M KI solution, it was indicated that the chemistry of the system was only affected at the highest of these three concentrations (evidence of molecular iodine production). This was in conformity with an initial test where 0.5 M K3B6O10 had been found to cause the immediate release of free iodine. Since 0.2M K3B6O10 was equivalent to 8.75 g of boron per liter, this was considered adequate for poisoning of the scrub solution.

It was evident in all laboratory tests that a certain amount of mist was always generated. Efforts to identify the chemical components of the mist were not successful since the material was extremely difficult to trap; however, analyses for fluoride and iodide were extremely low. It seemed probable that the mist was stabilized by the presence of I2 or H2O2.

In an engineering test of the MSRE facility, an additional gas colloid problem was encountered. Corrosion of the hot processing vessel (containing no salt) with fluorine led to the production of MoF2. Duplication of this MoO2 aerosol production was verified in laboratory tests with scrub solution and F2 containing MoF2.

Laboratory tests with different filtration and trapping methods showed that only a high-efficiency fiberglass filter was highly effective in stopping the MoO₂ aerosol and, at the same time, the always-present scrub mist. A high-efficiency filter downstream of the scrub solution was, therefore, installed in the MSRE processing facility.
