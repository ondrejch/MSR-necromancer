Design efforts on the MSRE continued on all fronts. Although findings of continuing studies necessitated some revisions, both the goals of the experiment and the basic design of the plant remained unchanged. The reactor is to provide facilities for the demonstration of safety, dependability, and serviceability of molten-salt systems and is intended to produce information on the behavior of graphite under irradiation and in contact with molten salts.

The reactor, fuel pump, and heat exchanger will be located in the reactor cell. A component and process piping layout was completed with a check of thermal stresses in the piping. Layout of auxiliary connections is in progress. The drain tank area layout is under revision following the decision to eliminate freeze flanges from the drain lines in the initial construction.

Detail drawings of the reactor were completed. A set of five molybdenum bands was included in the midplane of the graphite core to restrain bowing of the stringers caused by the fast-flux gradient. Four poison tubes are intended to introduce nuclear poison in the reactor to balance reactivity changes stemming from xenon sorption or potential fuel absorption in the moderator graphite.

Heat balance and neutron level measurements serve as the indicators of reactor power. Automatic control of reactor power appears necessary because of the sluggishness of the system and uncertainties of graphite. The poison tubes provide a total of 12% Ax/k for control purposes. Interlocking functions will control the heat withdrawal at the radiator.

Building and site improvements will be accomplished in four steps scheduled for completion by October 1961. Engineering is progressing consistent with this goal. Shielding requirements were established, and specification and design of services and utilities are in progress.

Design of an improved freeze flange for 6-inch molten-salt piping was completed, and such flanges are being fabricated for testing. Freeze flanges of the original design for 3-1/2-inch and 4-inch pipe passed a test consisting of 104 thermal cycles without mechanical failure, although excessive gas leakage occurred.

A sampler-enricher concept devised for the MSRE operates within a two-chambered dry box located above and to one side of the reactor pit. A mockup of its drive mechanism, latch, sample capsule, connecting tube, latch stop, and capsule guide was built and tested. A solder freeze valve is used to isolate the sampler during maintenance.

A maintenance philosophy including both remote and semi-direct operations was evolved for the MSRE. The remote maintenance demonstration facility was operated successfully with salt following extensive maintenance, thereby completing the demonstration. The facility is being converted to the study of sample MSRE problems; the first of which is the replacement of the fuel pump. A one-twelfth-scale model of the MSRE is being constructed; the reactor cell was completed.

A number of survey-type calculations were performed to obtain information concerning various alternative designs for the MSRE core. Dividing the core into two or three concentric cylindrical regions having different fuel volume fractions did not lead to a sufficient decrease in circulating-system inventory or sufficient improvement in the power-density shape to justify the additional complications arising in the fabrication of a multiregion core.

The reactivity worth of the proposed control poison tubes was estimated using a two-group, two-dimensional model with group constants derived from multigroup, one-dimensional calculations. The results indicate that the proposed four tubes have a total worth of 11% Δk/k, and that the tubes may be cut off 1 ft below the top of the core without serious loss of reactivity worth.

Preliminary nuclear calculations were completed for an MSRE core having the fuel separated from the graphite by INOR-8 tubes. For a core with 8 vol% fuel salt, insertion of 30-mil-thick 2-in. -diam INOR-8 tubes increased the critical circulating system inventory by about 70%. The percentage of fissions caused by thermal neutrons decreased from 92% to about 88%. The average number of fission neutrons released per neutron absorbed in the fuel was reduced from 2. 02 to 2. 00, and the temperature coefficient of reactivity due to the expansion of the core salt was reduced by about 1%.

Estimates were made of the dose rates at various places outside the reactor cell. Above the reactor cell top plug, having a thickness of 7 ft of ordinary concrete, the dose rate during 10-MW operation was estimated to be 90 mr/hr. Two hours after draining the core, this dose rate was 0. 47 mr/hr, and the integrated dose over a long period of time amounted to less than 25 mr.

Examinations were completed on two INOR-8 forced-convection loops which operated with fluoride mixtures for 8,100 and 14,500 hours. Attack in the form of surface roughening and pitting to a maximum depth of 1-1/2 mils was found in the former. The latter showed no attack, except for the formation of a thin surface layer.

Two thermal convection loop tests were started to determine the compatibility of the system salt-graphite-molybdenum-INOR-8, with the molybdenum in intimate contact with both the graphite and the INOR-8. The purpose of these tests is to confirm the feasibility of utilizing molybdenum bands to prevent lateral distortion of the graphite bundle in the MSRE core.

During routine welder-qualification tests on INOR-8, weld cracking was observed in some heats of material. A study is therefore being made to determine the reasons for the cracking and to develop methods for alleviating the condition. The addition of 2 wt% Nb to INOR-8 appears to completely overcome weld-metal cracking on the materials investigated. The Rensselaer Polytechnic Institute hot-ductility test is being used to determine the base-metal cracking susceptibility of several heats of INOR-8. Heats which have been shown to be subject to heat-affected-zone cracking also have exhibited poor hot ductility in this test.

The development of techniques for producing solidified-metal seals for molten salt reactor applications is continuing. An INOR-8 sump-type seal with gold-copper alloy operated successfully for ten closures. A metallographic evaluation of a Reactor Division sump-type seal was also conducted. A seal utilizing an impregnated metal-fiber compact was also successfully operated, and the experiment is described.

Investigations of Ni-Mo-Cr-Fe alloys had shown that an intermetallic compound formed at compositions above the upper limits specified for INOR-8. The investigation was continued to determine whether or not the intermetallic phase would form in alloys within the upper compositional limits of INOR-8. Microstructural examinations were made of a number of alloys with compositions within the range of interest, which had been heat-treated for various times and temperatures.

A radiographic technique was utilized to determine the distribution of LiF-BeFoThF-UF (67-18. 5-14-0. 5 mole %) salt in specimens of nine grades of low-permeability graphite following their exposure to the salt for 100 hours at 150 psig at 1300°F. It indicated that graphite can be made that will take up salt only in shallow (<50-mil) surface impregnation under the above conditions.

Twenty-hour treatments of graphite by the thermal decomposition products of NH4F-HF at 1300°F (704°C) appear to effectively remove oxygen from graphite so that it can contain LiF-BeF2-UO2 (62-37-1 mole %) for periods greater than 2000 hr at 1300°F (704°C) without a detectable precipitate forming.

Each containing four capsules were examined in hot cells at the Battelle Memorial Institute. In these capsules, delicate bellows were used for encapsulating graphite immersed in fused-salt fuel. Of the eight capsules examined, only one was found intact; the bellows' walls had ruptured in the other seven. It is believed that the expansion of the molten-salt fuel on melting (following a reactor scram) caused the ruptures. Examination of the graphite specimen from the intact capsule is discussed.

A new capsule design has been made for the third experiment, based on somewhat different criteria. One objective of this experiment, which also contains four capsules, is to study samples of graphite that have been irradiated under conditions more extreme than those expected in the MSRE reactor. For this purpose, two of the four graphite samples will be impregnated with a modified MSRE fuel. A second objective is to detect changes in the wetting characteristics of the fuel in contact with graphite under high-temperature irradiation. A third objective involves the inclusion of specimens of molybdenum, INOR-8, and pyrolytic graphite in contact with both the graphite and the fuel to demonstrate the compatibility of the principal components of the MSRE system. The four capsules consist of heavy-walled INOR-8 cylinders, each containing a 1-1/4-inch diameter, 3-inch long graphite cylinder. The upper half of each graphite cylinder is machined in the form of a boat-like cavity to contain 5 cc of molten-salt fuel, in which the pyrolytic graphite and the metal specimens will be suspended. The remainder of the experiment assembly is similar to that of the previous experiments.

Results of the post-irradiation examination of the SLA graphite specimen from ORNL experiment 7-2 at Battelle Memorial Institute are given. Examination of the external surfaces of the graphite, up to 34X magnification, revealed that the surfaces generally appeared to be unaffected by the irradiation. A study of a cross-sectional face of the cylindrical graphite specimen by autoradiography and core drilling indicated that the major portion of the fission-product activity was on.

On the very near to the exposed surfaces, except for a plane of porosity that extended longitudinally through the cylinder. Intrusion of fuel salt occurred through this fault. The remainder of the interior graphite was relatively free of radioactivity, with the exception of Cs-137. Data derived by Battelle are not sufficient to distinguish between mechanisms which could explain the presence of cesium in these internal areas, and additional radiochemical studies are being conducted on the specimen at ORNL.

The MSRE fuel composition has been revised to include 5 mole % ZrF4 and is now precipitation of UO2. When the ZrF4/UF4 mole ratio in the liquid is high enough, excess oxide under equilibrium conditions causes precipitation of ZrO2 rather than UO2. The protection due to ZrF4 remains effective until the ZrF4/UF4 mole ratio falls to about 2. Also, at higher ZrF4 concentrations, there may be a beneficial effect due to complexing of oxide ions by species such as ZrO2.

Xenon poisoning due to diffusion of xenon into the unclad graphite considered for use in the MSRE is more serious than was previously recognized and is difficult to remedy by merely decreasing the permeability of the graphite. The concentration gradient controlling the diffusion of xenon in the graphite tends to steepen sharply with lower gas permeabilities, giving an increased driving force which tends to counteract the benefits of an increased resistance.

The capillary behavior of MSRE fuel in graphite corresponds satisfactorily to the non-wetting performance expected from estimated surface tensions and measured densities, at least in clean systems. Exposure of the salt and graphite to air leads to the formation of oxide films at the interface and to superficial manifestations of good wetting.

The heat capacity of the liquid (between 550 and 800°C) was calculated to be 0. 451 cal/g-°C. This agrees well with the value 0. 458 cal/g-°C estimated from an empirical relationship developed from data for similar salt systems. A preliminary value of 0.

The study of heat transfer for the mixture LiF-BeF5-UF6-ThF4 (67-18. 5-0. 5-1 mol %) flowing in heated Inconel and INOR-8 tubes was discontinued after 7050 hr of circulation. A preliminary analysis of the data showed no significant trend as a function of the exposure time. The data lie on average 25% below the general heat transfer correlation for other normal fluids in the range Ne = 10,000 to 20,000.

MSRE fuel carrier salt (LiF-BeF2, 63-37 mole %) dissolved in boiling 90% H2O at an average rate of about 50 ml/hr for the first 10 min, but the rate dropped to <10 ml/hr subsequently. The decrease in the rate was probably due to a layer of soft material on the surface of the salt, which dissolved more slowly than.

A laboratory-model steady-state fluorinator was operated in four runs, which demonstrated that uranium could be recovered from a salt continuously. The primary problem was corrosion, probably because the design of the apparatus required operation at high temperatures. With a 0-min salt residence time and excess fluorine, approximately 98% of the uranium was removed in a one-stage fluorinator at about 650°C.

During the past six months, several revisions were made to the original MSRE concept. The major concept did not change; however, a large amount of design work was accomplished. A very brief restatement of the original plan will be made before taking up, in some detail, the features that have been modified.

The reactor consists of a graphite-moderated core encased in an INOR-8 container through which is pumped a molten-salt mixture consisting of LiF, BeF2, ZrF4, and ThF4, to which is added enough U-235 in the form of UF6 (approximately 0. 25 mole % UF6) to achieve criticality in the core. The reactor vessel, fuel circulating pump, and heat exchanger are located in the reactor containment cell.

The non-fuel-bearing coolant salt, LiF-BeF2 (66-34 mole %), circulates through the tube side of the heat exchanger and through the air-cooled radiator located outside the reactor cell. The coolant circulating pump is also located outside the cell in the same general region as the radiator.

Drain tanks for the fuel salt are located in the drain-tank cell, separate from the reactor cell but having the same atmosphere and pressure requirements. One addition was made to the drain-tank complex: a fourth tank for storage and subsequent batch-dispensing of spent fuel has been added. This fourth tank is located in a separate but adjacent cell.

Experiments have generally established that the fuel will permeate only about 1 vol% of certain grades of graphite. This degree of permeation occurs, however, in the absence of radiation and the possible complications imposed by fission fragment recoils in the graphite. At this stage, there are not enough in-pile data to warrant complete assurance that greater permeation will not occur in the reactor.

This lack of knowledge has brought about two modifications of design. One of these is the increase of fuel fraction within the core from 12% to 22. 5%. This increase minimizes the reactivity change associated with soaking of graphite by the fuel. It has an additional beneficial effect in that it reduces the concentration of uranium and therefore results in a lower fuel inventory.

The second design change involves the addition of poison tubes within the core. Four 1-inch-diameter inverted thimbles are now inserted in the core and provide means for inserting or removing liquid poison in a controlled manner. The tubes provide ample poison for overriding complete saturation of the graphite by fuel.

It is obvious from these design changes that, in addition to establishing the safety, dependability, and maintainability of the molten-salt reactor system, a fourth objective has been added to the project. This objective is to establish the feasibility of unclad graphite as a moderator for the molten-salt reactor.

Except for the changes referred to, the MSRE design proceeded in accordance with the original plan. Component design, system layout, building alteration design, and services provisions progressed satisfactorily. Detailed discussion of these design phases follows.

A number of significant changes to the reactor core and vessel were made during the period covered by this report. Briefly, they are: the flow rate was reduced to 1200 gpm; the core inlet volute was changed to a flow distributor; the fuel volume in the core was increased to 22-1/2%; a poison system was added; a method of sampling graphite near the outer periphery will be added; a neutron shield was incorporated in the head, and other minor changes were made.

The reactor receives the fuel salt from the cold end of the fuel heat exchanger. Once in the vessel, the salt passes down in a 1-inch-wide annulus in a helical path. The swirl is stopped at the bottom of the vessel, and the fuel flows upward through the graphite-moderated core, through the holes of the neutron shield, and finally leaves through a bellmouthed outlet pipe.

The reduction in flow rate and increased volume lowered the velocity to approximately 0. 72 fps, and the Reynolds number to approximately 1200. The flow in the annulus remains turbulent, and maintaining the core wall at a reasonable temperature presents no problem.

The fuel flow passages will be machined in the four faces of the graphite stringers, but no cross-communicating channels will be provided. Five molybdenum bands will cover the middle one-third of the matrix. It is possible that a full cross-sectional break could occur in a graphite stringer. Should this happen, the upper piece would tend to float upward approximately 3/4 in. , creating a fuel pocket 2x2x3/4 in. This fuel, being relatively stagnant, might reach a very high temperature. To prevent this possibility, an INOR rod will be placed horizontally through the upper ends of the graphite blocks, one rod in each row.

The coarse screen at the top will not be used, but a neutron shield will be placed in the upper head. This shield will be a large INOR-8 casting of circular shape but varying in thickness from 4-3/4 in. near the outer edge to approximately.

A poison-tube system (shown in Fig. 1) was added for control during startup and to compensate for xenon poisoning effects. Poisoning will be accomplished by means of a molten salt composed of LiOP and BeF2. In the reactor, the poison salt tubes enter the reactor vessel through the lower head on a 4-in. radius and extend through the graphite stringers to the upper end where they are capped off.

The section of the tube that passes through the lower head is a 3/4-inch pipe and joins the 1-inch OD tube just inside the vessel. Outside the reactor vessel, a 1/2-inch pipe goes to a reservoir located just above the flow distributor; thus, the vessel head extends to the upper end where it terminates open-ended. Gas pressure is required to keep the poison out of the reactor, thus providing a failsafe condition.

The fuel inlet volute was replaced by a flow distributor. The distributor is composed of a perforated section of the vessel wall and a constant-area casing around the outside of the vessel enclosing these holes. The holes are 3/8 in. in diameter and enter the vessel wall at a 30° angle to the tangent to the outer vessel surface. This arrangement provides the swirling flow desirable in the annulus.

Drafts of heat transfer and pressure drop design reports were completed. A summary of stress calculations was also drafted. Specifications were approved. According to the specifications, the fabricator will be responsible for detail design and completion of the stress analysis.

The design of an air-cooled radiator coil, enclosure, and superstructure was completed, and drawings were submitted for checking and review. A few minor changes in the physical arrangement as previously reported were made, and Table 1. 3 gives the current radiator-coil design data.

The subheaders were redesigned to be forged from solid stock and bored to nominal 2-1/2-in. schedule 40 pipe dimensions. This change eliminated a difficult welding situation by providing integral forged and bored nipples on the subheaders to which the radiator tubes will be welded. It also eliminated the need for a separate line previously required for draining the subheaders.

Design of an insulated structure for enclosing and supporting the radiator coil was also completed. During periods when heat must be supplied to the coil to maintain the coolant salt in a liquid state, the doors will be closed to form a reasonably airtight enclosure. The radiator coil will be heated by means of panels containing resistance.

The bypass duct will be used to reduce the wind force on the radiator door in the event of a power failure or reactor scram. In either of these occurrences, the radiator doors will be closed, and the fans will be running down, still delivering air. The air will then be routed around the radiator through the open bypass, reducing the air static pressure on the radiator.

Designs were completed for two duplicate fuel drain tanks, one flush-salt tank, and one coolant drain tank. Dimensional changes were made on all four tanks. The new design data is listed in Table 1. 4. The nozzle connections are subject to change in accordance with the layout of the tanks in their cell.

Two minor additional changes were made on the fuel drain tanks: a guard was added to protect the flexible steam tubes from incidental damage during maintenance, and the size of the steam dome was reduced to facilitate maintenance of the tank.

The drain-tank area for the fuel system was revised. Freeze flanges, originally intended to be used on the drain lines, are cumbersome, making the layout difficult and may never be required. The drain lines will be installed as an all-welded system. At points where lines must be removed if replacement of pipe or components becomes necessary, provision will be made for a brazed seal when the new pipe is put in. Brazed joints are satisfactory for salt systems, particularly for small-diameter pipes and locations which are only temporarily in contact with molten salt. Both these conditions apply to the drain lines.

The drain valve for the fuel system is now located directly under the reactor vessel. When this valve is frozen, the drain line from the valve back to the drain tank manifold will be drained of salt. This is made possible by a vent line which runs from the drain-tank side of the valve to the gas space within the pump bowl. Drawings showing this drain system, including the drain-tank arrangement, are being revised and are not ready for inclusion in this report.

The area immediately north of the drain-tank area has been allocated for spent fuel storage and transfer operations. It is assumed that fuel will be transferred to another location for reprocessing. Both the capacity of existing processing facilities and calculations of shielding requirements indicate that the size of individual shipments should be 50 liters, and thus each fuel charge will have to be subdivided into approximately 30 batches for transfer to the processing plant. Recovery of the uranium from a fuel charge will require three to six months, and it seems desirable to isolate the spent fuel from the operational storage tanks if simultaneous power operation and spent-fuel processing are contemplated.

Detailed studies are being made of the auxiliary piping, power cable, and disconnect layout, and thermocouple cable and disconnect layout in the reactor containment cell. Electrical leads for the heaters will terminate in receptacles into which plugs from each heater section can be inserted. These plug units can be inserted or removed remotely by means of the maintenance equipment provided. The design of these plugs and receptacles was completed, and specimens were fabricated for testing.

The decay time of the recycled helium was increased to a minimum of 72 days of xenon holdup. The maximum quantity of radioactivity permitted in the stored helium was reduced to 15 curies. These changes were made in order to minimize the hazard involved in storing radioactive gas. Under the original design, a total contained activity of 7000 curies was possible.

The dryer and oxygen-removal units in the fresh helium supply are being designed to operate at 250 psig. This change will eliminate the need for recompressing the gas in this portion of the system, improving both the economy and reliability of the operation.

All salt-containing components and lines in the system must be equipped with heaters that will satisfy two requirements. First, lines and components must be preheated from room temperature to 1250°F before salt is introduced, and second, heat losses must be counterbalanced during periods of zero power operation. Power input into the system from the heaters will be regulated by varying the voltage applied to the heating elements. Voltage regulation is to be provided by three-phase induction regulators presently installed in Building 7503. Metallic-sheathed, mineral-insulated cables will enter the cell and terminate in disconnects for each heating unit. End seals on both ends will prevent gas leakage through the cables.

The heating element of resistance heating coils (Nichrome V) is embedded in fused alumina. Embedding the coils in a ceramic material offers several advantages over an open coil design. Among these are a uniform release of heat and a more positive protection against a short to ground of the electrical conductor. The thermal insulation shown is a lightweight refractory fiber in felted form. The principal constituents of this fiber are alumina and silica. The housing will contain particulate matter within the unit and will also provide a means by which tools can be attached to the unit for removal or installation. The unit is split on the center line. Attached to the clamshells are hinges, straps, and latches to secure the unit on the pipe. A similar unit can be fabricated for the pipe bends.

Tubes are insulated from the containers by ceramic insulators. The heater tubes can be replaced without removing the thermal-neutron cover shield. To minimize heating in the cover-shield portion of the circuit, a transition is made from thermal insulation encased in Inconel sheets attached to the cylindrical walls and also to the top and bottom shielding.

Contained within Inconel sheets supported by the steel framework, the curved ceramic heating elements are housed within a structure akin to a picture frame. Each frame represents a 100° segment that is removable from above. The top cover and bottom contain insulation exclusively.

The fuel heat exchanger heater is shown in Fig. 12. The housing is hinged on top to allow the unit to be opened. One half of the heater assembly is swung up and rests on top of the other half to allow the heating elements to be replaced from above. The ceramic heating elements are contained in frames for handling.

The drain line from the reactor will be heated by the passage of approximately 675 amps at 19 V through the pipe wall. This method of heating was selected because the drain line is approximately 55 ft long, has limited access from above, and would probably require 25 units if heated with individually removable heaters.

All piping and components of the coolant-salt system that are located outside the containment vessel will be heated and insulated in a conventional manner since direct access for maintenance is possible. The radiator enclosure will be lined with flat ceramic heating elements with a capability of 60 kW. These units will be energized at all times because without this precaution, salt could freeze very quickly in the tubes in a loss-of-flow incident.

Studies were made of the arrangement of the operating area, the design of the maintenance control room, the arrangement of the various concrete shielding blocks, and the coverage of the cranes. As a result of this work, certain decisions were reached which determine the nature of the remote-maintenance tools that are.

Efforts are now being concentrated on the layout of connection points for the various remotely operated tools, the necessary racks for storage of these tools, the arrangement of controls within the maintenance control room, and the design of jacks for separating the freeze flanges in the primary system.

Would provide complete reactor safety and stability. These alterations stemmed principally from hypothetical problems with the graphite, namely: (1) fuel salt soak-up and retention in the 7% connected void space, and (2) xenon diffusion into.

The reactivity changes expected from these mechanisms are gradual but will necessitate shimming. Fuel penetration into the graphite creates, but to a lesser degree, the xenon problem associated with solid-fuel reactors and also produces a power coefficient of reactivity. The power coefficient arises from the fact that the temperature coefficient of reactivity in the graphite is twice that of the fuel. For these reasons, the MSRE will be equipped with an external control and safety.

Four poison tubes containing Li OP-BeP5 salt are being considered as the means of providing shimming, safety, and control. This concept will be thoroughly tested before adoption. Three of the tubes will be used for shim-safety purposes and will have an individual worth of 44% Ak/k when all other tubes are fully withdrawn. The combined worth, fully inserted, is 11% Ak/k. Withdrawal speed will be limited to a safe value. The fourth tube will have a maximum worth of 1% Ak/k and will be used for control purposes.

Nuclear instrument channels for measurement, control, and safety will be as follows: (1) two fission counter channels for startup and low-level operation; (2) two log N channels covering the upper six decades of reactor power; and (3) three independent power-level channels used solely for safety.

Experience gained on the ARE and subsequent analog simulator studies show that automatic control of reactor power is a necessity in the low and medium power region. This is because small temperature changes represent large percentage changes in reactor power and because of the loose coupling between the radiator.

The automatic controller will utilize two inputs: heat power and the output from a neutron-sensitive ion chamber. The heat power input is used for accurate power determinations and to reset periodically and automatically the ion chamber, which will provide the necessary transient response. This system has been proposed for the EGCR and the Pebble-Bed Reactor Experiment.

The radiator is the most sensitive component from the standpoint of system integrity, control of reactor power, and operational continuity. Salt freezing must not take place in the radiator. The vertically sliding doors, which thermally isolate the radiator, will automatically drop, and electrical heat will be supplied if coolant-salt temperature, measured at the radiator, approaches the freezing point. This automatic door closure will be preceded by automatic blower shutoff and by opening the airflow bypass around the radiator. These safety actions are also automatic and will be produced by coolant-salt temperatures intermediate between the operating temperature and door-closure temperature.

Involves fairly extensive changes to the building and services of various kinds within the building. The design work on all modifications will be done by ORNL. This engineering attained a completely definitive and fairly advanced executional status in the past six months.

These packages will be completed in the order given above, with the last one (D) scheduled to be finished by October 1961. The status of design drawings is such as to be consistent with this completion date. Effort will be maintained at the necessary level to assure meeting the design schedule.

All requirements for shielding were established, and the load-bearing walls, which will also serve as biological shielding, were engineered. Loose aggregate, cooled by flowing water, will be used between the reactor cell and the secondary steel tank, which encloses the reactor cell.

Electrical services were specified, and the actual distribution system is partially drawn. Three separate power sources will be available for the building. There will be two 13. 8-kV service lines from separate 154-kV TVA substations. In addition to these, there are three 300-kW diesel power units to provide emergency power in case of power failure on both TVA lines.

Phase I, which includes all demolition work and some minor alterations to the building, will be accomplished by a cost-plus-fixed-fee contractor. This decision is based on the fact that this work is a small portion of the entire job and can be accomplished under field direction without extensive engineering drawings. This phase is ready for release to a contractor.

Phase II work will be accomplished by lump-sum contractors. It includes major modifications and additions to the reactor building: erection of additional shielding walls, extension of the reactor primary containment vessel, modification of drain tank and storage pits, modification of the radiator pit, and construction of the remote-maintenance control room. Also included are the waste storage pond, the off-gas system, the cooling tower for waste heat removal (other than reactor heat), and miscellaneous utilities.

Complexity is included in this phase. The installation of the INOR-8 fuel and coolant systems will be made by laboratory craftsmen experienced in working with the special materials required. Individual components, such as pumps, heat exchangers, the reactor vessel, and various fuel and coolant tanks, will be fabricated by outside vendors who are experienced in fabricating reactor components of special alloys.

In order to minimize the cost of qualifying welders and the cost of field inspection, an effort will be made to have all major components fabricated by a single vendor. Bidders will be requested to submit bids for the fabrication of a complete package of components consisting of the heat exchanger, the radiator, the reactor vessel, and fuel and coolant drain and storage tanks. Under this option, a vendor will be permitted to eliminate from his proposal any component he does not wish.

Gas leakage was excessive during the cooldown portion of each thermal cycle in which the standard clamp ring was used, with either a nickel-plated copper gasket or a gold-plated Inconel gasket. The seal was greatly improved by using a newly designed resilient clamp ring with either type of gasket. However, indications are that the copper gasket is forced deeper into the flange grooves with each thermal cycle, and that the seal would eventually fail from this.

No cooling air was supplied to the 3-1/2-inch flange during one of the thermal cycles. The frozen-salt seal formed at a larger radius than during normal cycles but was still sufficiently smaller than the gas-seal radius to ensure a reliable salt seal and to prevent contamination of the gas-seal gasket surfaces.

A seal-test facility is being constructed to permit dry thermal cycling of test flanges under more closely controlled conditions and with better leak detection than in the flowing-salt facility. Figure 2. 2 shows the arrangement of a test flange in the facility. Preheating is accomplished by clamshell heaters on the buffer annulus of the gas seal. By flooding either the inside or the outside of the flange with helium, either of the gasket seals may be checked. Initially, two test flanges will be accommodated, with space provided for two additional stations to be added at a later date if the need arises.

Testing of the direct resistance-heated valve, shown in Fig. 3, was terminated after completion of 100 freeze-thaw examinations. Freezing was carried out for 10 to 15 minutes, with a flow rate of 55 cfm. Ten cfm was required to maintain the plug. The plug was determined by the temperature of the cooling air; the average.

At the completion of the induction-heated test, the induction coil was removed and replaced by two 1-kW, 24-inch-long Calrods rated at 1500°F sheath temperature, again for 10 to 15 minutes, with 10 cfm of air required to maintain the plug melt time.

A prototype clamshell heater for use on the MSRE piping has been fabricated and is ready for testing. Figure 2. 5 is a cutaway drawing of this type of heater and its associated insulation. The heaters will be formed for the particular size and shape of the pipe to be heated, with the requirement that they can be replaced with a remote manipulator.

The MSRE core-vessel heaters required to bring the vessel to operating temperature are divided into replaceable sections, each containing seven heaters. A full-scale mockup of one such section was built for testing. The setup includes k-in. of Cerafelt (a trade name of Johns-Manville Corporation) insulation covered.

The sampler-enricher system mechanism operates within a two-chambered, shielded dry box located on top of a shielding slab above and to one side of the reactor cell. A connecting tube joins the gas space of the fuel pump bowl to the dry box. The tube penetrates the containment vessel at a 45° angle. The drive mechanism for raising and lowering a capsule is located inside the inner compartment of the dry box.

An outline of the procedure required to obtain a sample is as follows: A pretreated sample capsule, sealed in a gas-tight container, is lowered into the outer compartment of the dry box. Air is purged from the cell and replaced with helium.

The door between the two compartments is opened, and the capsule is removed from the container and connected to a latch on the drive mechanism. With the door closed and operational and maintenance valves opened, the capsule is lowered into the pump tank to obtain the sample. The sample is raised into the dry box, and the operational valve is closed. Fission-product gases are purged from the inner compartment before the door is opened. After purging, the capsule is resealed in the gas-tight can, and the door is closed. The can is then drawn into a shielded.

Since the latch will be operated remotely, it is highly desirable to keep frozen salt away from the parts that must be disengaged. Therefore, a latch stop was designed to be located on top of the pump tank above the maximum operating level of the fuel salt. To reach the bottom of the pump tank, the capsule must extend 10 in. below the latch. This long assembly must have a flexible connection to move through the two 45° offsets in the connecting tube. To prevent the capsule from being washed around in the pump bowl by the turbulent flow of the salt, a guide cage was designed to fit inside the pump. The cage consists of five 1/8-in. INOR-8 rods with a stiffener ring to hold them in place. The estimated maximum temperature of the rods due to beta-gamma heating in the gas space is approximately.

One design criterion for the sampler-enricher system requires that the components located outside the reactor cell be replaceable. A reliable valve must, therefore, be provided to prevent the escape of fission-product gases during such maintenance operations. A metal freeze valve is being developed for this application. It is expected that this valve would be closed only a few times during its life.

An apparatus was constructed to test the feasibility of a metal freeze valve, which operates by melting and refreezing a pool of solder. The wetted parts of a simulated 1-inch valve were fabricated from INOR-8; the other parts were fabricated.

A 72% Ag - 28% Cu solder (melting point 1434°F) was believed to have the desired wetting characteristics and thermal expansion properties when in contact with INOR-8. Since the valve was designed for service in a gas region, the compatibility of the solder with fluoride salt was not considered to be an important factor. Diffusion of constituents between the molten solder and INOR-8 may be a.

A test cycle for the valve consisted of melting the solder, opening and closing the valve, and allowing the solder to refreeze. Oxygen was purged from the system before each cycle by evacuating the air and pressurizing the system with argon to about 1 psig. Even with repeated purgings, traces of oxygen remained in the system as evidenced by an adherent oxide film on all metal parts. No flux was added to the system.

The valve was operated successfully for 37 of the first 41 cycles. The leak rate through the seal was < 10-8 cc of helium per second at a pressure differential of 30 psi across the valve. Failures occurred during cycles 1, 2, 11, and 17. During the first two cycles, when the maximum solder temperature was 1455 and 1471°F, respectively, the gas seal was not tight. By increasing the temperature to 1500°F and holding it there for 15 min or longer, a gas-tight seal could be formed reproducibly in the subsequent cycles. The other two leaks resulted from failure to lower the valve cap deep enough into the pool of solder. This will be corrected in the MSRE valve by a positioning device. During the 41 cycles, the solder was at 1500°F or above for 73 hr. When a gas-tight seal failed to form during the next two cycles, the test was terminated, and the valve was opened for inspection.

Figure 2. 11 shows the valve cap as it appeared after testing. The ridges at the top of the solder region are primarily metal oxide resulting from incomplete removal of oxygen from the system. This difficulty should not occur in the reactor.

Chemical analysis of the solder before and after testing showed that considerable nickel, and some chromium and iron had been picked up during the test. However, even with the changes in composition, no change in the melting point was detected.

Volute and the core-wall cooling annulus. The principal objective of the orifice distributor is to attain uniformity of flow to the annulus. The average velocity distribution in the volute with the final orifice design is shown in Fig. 13. Measurements were made at design flow rate and at 40% of the design flow rate.

Note that, at the design flow rate, the velocity suddenly increases from approximately 14 fps in the inlet pipe to approximately 23 fps in the volute head. This is because of recirculation of fluid around the volute. Flow distribution from the volute to the annulus is proportional to the velocity gradient at any point around the volute, and it can be seen that within the limits of experimental error, it is constant in the model. As the fluid leaves the volute region and moves down the core-wall cooling annulus, the swirl component of velocity decreases; therefore, the resultant total velocity drops. The lowest total velocity is at the bottom of the annulus and was measured to be 4. 2 fps. Further, it was found to be constant within the limits of experimental error all the way around the reactor. This velocity gives a Reynolds number of approximately 20,000 and a resultant heat transfer coefficient of over 1000 Btu/hr-ft2-r, which is more than adequate for the core-wall.

Residence times were measured in the lower head of the one-fifth-scale model by a salt conductivity technique. It appears that the highest fluid temperature in the lower head, which is next to the wall and at the vessel centerline, will be less than 20°F above the mixed-mean temperature in the lower head.

A test unit was designed and constructed to evaluate titanium, uranium, and other materials for use as high-temperature oxygen getters. The data will be used as a guide in designing the oxygen removal units for the cover-gas system. The test unit will be operated in conjunction with an oxygen analyzer currently under development. If successful, the analyzer will read oxygen concentrations in the range of.

Because the proposed modifications to Building 7503 will not provide complete biological shielding when the roof plugs are removed from atop the reactor cell or drain-tank cell, it has been decided to adopt a dual maintenance philosophy that will permit working directly through the shielding when possible or remotely controlling the manipulator from a shielded maintenance control room whenever removal of all the cell shielding is required for an operation.

The lower roof plugs will be subdivided into units 2 ft wide by a length determined by the width of each of the five bays. A portable, steel maintenance shield (0. 14) that can cover the opening left by the removal of two adjacent plugs will be provided for semi-direct work.

Maintenance that requires a larger opening (e. g. , the removal of the heat exchanger, the reactor vessel, or a drain tank) will be accomplished by the removal of all the cell shielding and the use of the manipulator-television complex. At such time, the shielded maintenance control room will probably be the only portion of the building suited to long-term occupancy.

Designs of the cell shielding and the layout of components are being made in accordance with the requirements of the dual philosophy. Designs for electrical and instrument disconnects, auxiliary piping disconnects, and smaller components such as the pipe heaters, vessel heaters, and the pump and motor are taking advantage of the ability to use several hands in the semi-direct maintenance approach.

Before a second salt run could be made to complete the demonstration, it was necessary to improve the heating of the fill-and-drain line, particularly near a pair of flanges and at a freeze valve. This involved adding and rearranging heaters and channeling the cooling air to the freeze valve to localize the freeze plug. After these changes were made, the system was heated to 1200-1250°F in 73 hours, and salt was circulated for 4-1/2 hours. The system was then drained and permitted to cool. These operations were conducted with no difficulty.

Remote disassembly and reassembly were performed on the pump, the pump motor, the reactor assembly, and the heat exchanger. Part of this work was accomplished by new operators in training and with new techniques. Although a completely remote operation could have been performed by an experienced operator, the actual operation included some direct vision as an aid to the trainees.

A mockup of a pipe run with freeze flange and pipe supports has been designed and is being constructed. It will be used primarily for the development of equipment for remotely separating and closing the freeze flanges while maintaining the required precise alignment, and secondarily for the development of closures and tools for replaceable pipe heaters.

The detailed design of several tools for use with the portable maintenance shield has been completed, and construction has begun. The tools will be tested in the remote maintenance facility and will be integrated into the MSRE tool inventory.

A one-twelfth-scale model of Building 7503, columns 3 to 9, sections A, B, and C, has been designed and is being constructed. It will be a functional model to aid in the design, construction, and maintenance of the MSRE. The reactor cell containing the reactor with its associated heaters and shield, the pump, the heat exchanger, and fuel and coolant piping has been completed (see. 15).

It has been decided to eliminate freeze flanges from the salt system of the drain tank cell. The salt system will be of all-welded construction. In the event a component must be replaced, the 1/2-inch and/or 1-1/2-inch salt piping will be cut, and the replacement component joined to the system by a brazed joint. It is necessary to develop mechanical equipment for remotely cutting the pipe, cleaning, aligning the joint, heating in the proper atmosphere, and inspecting the final product.

Many pipe and tube disconnects are required on MSRE auxiliary lines to permit replacement of components. Included in the auxiliary lines are lubricating oil, helium, air, etc. Generally, specifications require that leak rates for the mechanical joints be less than 1 x 10-6 std cc of helium per second as tested by a mass spectrometer. System pressures will vary between 20 and 200 psia, and temperatures between 75 and 1000°F. Materials used in disconnects must be able to withstand radiation doses of 1 x 10^10 rads.

Initially, disconnects were desired, which could easily be operated remotely by a one-armed manipulator. Since the adoption of the dual-maintenance concept, it has been decided to use helium-buffered ring-joint flanges as disconnects. These can very easily be broken and remade through the portable shield and can, if necessary, be maintained with the manipulator.

Prior to the decision to use ring-joint flanges, which are not expected to require any development, several promising disconnects were evolved. These types were subjected to pressure-cycling in steam, temperature cycling between 200 and 1000°F in air, and make-break cycles. The most promising disconnect for use on radioactive lines is the spring-ring joint shown in figure 16. This is essentially a tongue-and-groove joint which seals at two concentric line contacts with a helium buffer or leak detector region between the two sealing surfaces. For nonradioactive lines, the cone-seat disconnect may be used (also shown in figure 16). Here the male cone is clamped into the female recess, compressing the cone sufficiently to form a seal but limiting the stress below the yield point of the metal.

In addition to the single disconnects, multiple cone-seat disconnects (up to seven per block) were tested successfully. Another multiple disconnect, which appeared promising, was a ring-joint flange with manifold parts and a number of concentric Flexitallic gasket seals.

The operation of long-term forced-circulation corrosion test loops, eight of INOR-8 and two of Inconel, was concluded during this period. Table 2. 1 gives a summary of the loops operated during this period and termination dates. Where loops had sections removed for metallurgical examination prior to final termination, this is noted in the table.

At the conclusion of the forced-circulation corrosion test program for the MSRE, the operating experience of the 25 pump loops (9 of Inconel and 16 of INOR-8) is summarized as follows: The 25 loops operated for a total of 289,483 hours at test conditions, with 20 of the 25 operating for at least one year. The 9 loops of Inconel operated an average of one year each, while the 16 loops of INOR-8 accumulated a total of 24 years of operation.

Of the 25 loops, 18 were shut down for examination as scheduled, and 7 were shut down prematurely because of mechanical failures. The seven breakdowns may be classified as follows: four cases of improper operator procedure in thawing frozen salt lines, causing pipe breaks; one case of improper maintenance procedure, causing a tubing failure during a maintenance operation; one case of continual malfunction of the pump clutch, leading to excessive maintenance cost; and one case of material failure in a machined INOR-8 fitting.

Two test sections, incorporating graphite, molybdenum, and INOR-8, were designed and fabricated for testing in molten-salt thermal convection loops. long encased in a 1-1/4-in. The first test section placed in operation consisted of two graphite units, and the second consisted of four units. The salt-to-graphite volume ratios of the two loops are approximately 2:1 and 1:1, respectively.

The graphite units were machined from type RO025 graphite, a low-permeability grade produced by National Carbon Company. The molybdenum was cut into strips 1/16 inch in the drawing to provide spring-force contact against the graphite in the slots and against the INOR-8 spacer sleeves inserted at the ends. Six molybdenum strips were placed in each graphite unit. The flow passage through the center of the graphite has the same diameter as the loop piping.

The first loop test, with two graphite units, began operation in October 1960, and the second loop, with four units, began operation in December 1960. The salt mole %. In preparation for filling with salt, the loops were evacuated at room temperature and slowly brought up to 1140°F. They were held at this temperature for 16 hr and brought up to 1300°F (operating temperature) while the vacuum was maintained. The system was held at 1300°F for another 16 hr before being filled with salt.

Design, water testing, and thermal analysis of the MSRE fuel pump received emphasis during the report period. Contracts were signed for obtaining pump impeller-and-volute combinations of cast INOR-8. Procurement was initiated for pump drive motors and variable-frequency supply.

(a) Fuel Pump Water Tests. Fabrication of equipment for the fuel pump water test was completed, and tests were performed on priming, fountain (up-the-shaft) flow, coastdown characteristics, head flow speed characteristics, and the effectiveness of the xenon removal stripper.

The test facility consists of a closed loop constructed of 6-inch pipe. The loop includes a venturi flowmeter, a throttle valve, and an orifice flow restrictor (not shown). Provisions are available for measuring head, flow, speed, pump input power, and temperature. The hydraulic design of the test pump and that of the reactor fuel pump are identical.

Normal hydraulic performance was achieved by the end of pump acceleration for all runs except the one with a 0. 5-inch starting level, which required approximately an additional minute. These data should not be used for reactor-system computations unless differences in volumes of system-trapped gas are accounted for.

The behavior of the fountain flow was observed over a wide range of operating conditions and found to be in the desired direction, outward from the shaft annulus into the pump tank. In particular, the resistance lines through 45 and 55 ft of head at 1450 gpm were traversed satisfactorily over the speed range.

Coastdown tests were performed to determine the time required for the pump motor to stop after the drive motor was disconnected from the electric supply. Tests were conducted on the same flow-resistance line for operating speeds. Coastdown times ranged from 10. 1 to 10. 4 seconds elapsed times for flow reduction.

Performance data were obtained over a wide range of operating conditions. The results are shown in Figure 19. These data cover the range of 27 to 70 ft of head and 750 to 1700 gpm of flow. The bypass flow into the pump tank for these data was 50 gpm, measured at 1450 rpm and 1030 rpm.

The effectiveness of various xenon-removal stripper configurations was investigated for throughputs up to 35 gpm. These investigations were conducted with distilled water initially supersaturated with CO2. By monitoring the pH of the water, the time to reduce the concentration of dissolved CO2 gas by a factor of 2 was measured. The time required for an ideal 100% effective stripper was computed to be 1. 9 min, and times of 2. 2 min were measured for several stripper configurations.

The conversion of an existing NaK pump test facility to circulate molten salt was completed. The pump has been in operation continuously for 3720 hours. A pumping experiment, utilizing radioactive Kr85 as a tracer gas, has been planned for this pump to determine the extent of back diffusion of fission gases in the pump-shaft annulus from the gas space in the pump tank to the region of the lower oil seal. A radiation safety review of the experiment was completed, and the design was revised to provide additional safety. The experiment fabrication is complete. After calibration of the instruments, the experiment will be connected to the PK-P loop.

Thermal-Stress Analysis for Fuel Pump. The most severe thermal stresses in the pump tank have been found to occur in the cylindrical neck at the junctions with the torispherical shell and the pump-tank flange. The high stresses are caused by the high overall temperature differences between the hot end (~1300°F) and the cold end (200°F) of the cylinder, high thermal gradients, and rapid changes in thermal gradient. Temperature distributions in the pump tank and shield plug were determined for several operating conditions by the GHT (Generalized Heat Transfer) code.

Temperature profiles were estimated for the cylindrical portion of the pump tank and the volute support for several degrees of cooling of the torispherical shell. A metal temperature of 1000°F at the junction of the spherical head and the cylinder and an assumed reasonable temperature profile produced the following thermal bending stresses: at the volute, 5308 psi; at the sphere-neck junction, 16,900 psi; at the top flange, 24,000 psi. These stresses must be combined with the pressure stresses to obtain the maximum principal stresses.

Revised GHT code input data has been calculated, and machine calculations are currently in progress to determine the temperature distributions more precisely under several operating conditions. The spherical shell is caused by the presence of windows in the lower portion of the volute support, which increases the thermal resistance to removal of the nuclear deposited heat in the volute support. This temperature is believed to be excessive, and further refinements in the geometry and calculation procedures are being made to reduce the peak temperature and gradients.

Designs for the fuel pump hot test stand were completed, and fabrication has started. The test facility consists of a closed loop constructed of 6-inch Inconel pipe. The loop contains a venturi flow meter, a flow straightener, and an orifice flow restrictor. The orifice is located in a freeze flange and is replaceable for the purposes of varying the system flow resistance. The system will be equipped with provisions for measuring head, flow, pump speed, pump input power, and system temperatures. The loop is equipped with a cooler section for assistance in temperature control. The loop will contain the necessary preheaters and thermal insulation.

The design of the coolant pump water test is essentially complete. The tests will be used to determine the hydraulic performance of the pump and to determine the feasibility of conducting the coolant pump hot tests in the fuel pump volute.

End with one molten-salt-lubricated bearing. The pump containing one salt-lubricated journal bearing continued in operation, circulating for 7440 hours and has been stopped and started 72 times. There has been no discernible leakage of oil from the shaft seal.

The small frozen-lead-sealed pump failed on December 20, 1960, after 22,000 hours of operation. It had operated continuously until the shaft jammed and stalled the small fractional-horsepower motor drive. The 3/16-inch shaft parted during attempts to free it, and the test was terminated.

The pump was removed from the loop and cut open as shown in Fig. 24. The left half is shown as-cut; the right half shows the barrel and shaft with the lead and salt removed. The lower half of the pump barrel, as shown by area 6 in Fig. 24, consisted of a porous, reddish-brown mixture of nickel and lead oxide. The corrosion of the Inconel barrel (area 5 in Fig. 24) is visible to the eye; the shaft remains at this level.

The shaft had also been eroded, apparently by the abrasiveness of the oxide at the frozen-seal area illustrated in the sectional view of. 23 (see also area 7 in. 24). The shaft parted at this point when attempts were made to free it before shutdown. Further investigation will be made of the materials in.

The loop is situated above and below the track floor of Building 9201-3, as line, dual freeze valves, and drain tanks are shown in. 26 below the floor level. The reservoirs shown on the vertical risers from each freeze valve are for the purpose of retaining sufficient salt on draining of the loop to form a frozen.

In conjunction with the sampler-enricher system (to be tested on the engineering test loop later in the program), a capsule guide and retainer were fabricated and installed on the lid of the DANA pump bowl. Provisions are also included on the pump bowl for a manual salt sampler and a differential-pressure type of level indicator.

The insulation for most sheathed thermocouple wire is chemically hygroscopic; consequently, the sheath must be made hermetically tight. The liquid sealant is unsatisfactory because of the effects of radiation and high-temperature damage. This process takes approximately 8 hours.

The use of two-wire single-conductor sheathed thermocouples is being proposed for the MSRE. The problems associated with two-conductor cables also apply to single-conductor cables. Figure 2. The attachment of a single-conductor end seal is similar to that of a two-conductor end seal. The sheath material for the thermocouple wire can be stainless steel, aluminum, copper, iron, Inconel, INOR-8, or some other material. Aluminum-sheathed cables are more difficult to seal than other materials. Inconel or INOR-8 will be used for the sheath material in most MSRE applications. The plug and jack are fabricated from Electrobestos, which can be purchased from numerous manufacturers. This assembly is designed for use in a nuclear environment at elevated temperatures.

Accomplished by the aid of guide pins of different diameters, the guide pins also act as a polarizing key for the disconnect. The unit has been operated very satisfactorily in the remote-maintenance demonstration facility. The basic unit, as shown, can be modified to accommodate as many thermocouples as the user might require. For the MSRE, the basic four-thermocouple unit will be used and will be modified for two and eight thermocouples. This unit is fabricated from Unistrut, Unistrut fittings, and Electrobestos plugs and jacks for an elevated-temperature nuclear environment.

Figure 2. 33 shows an electrical disconnect for three-phase power operation. This unit has an electrical rating of 40 amps, three-phase, 600 V AC. Both were designed for remote handling and a nuclear radiation environment. Inorganic materials are used in their fabrication; the metallic parts are aluminum and silicon bronze, and the insulating materials are porcelain and lava. The units are operated by a straight-line push-pull motion with a force of less than 25 lb required for operation. Intended for non-polarized balanced-load service, they can be polarized by the addition of a guide key. Both units have been tested in the remote maintenance demonstration facility and are easily operated. The units will be fabricated by an outside manufacturer in accordance with ORNL designs and specifications.

Figure 2. 34 shows a prototype instrument disconnect with a maximum rating of 100 V AC or DC, which is being developed for use in the MSRE. The unit is fabricated from inorganic components; the insulating material is fired lava, and the housing is aluminum. The unit is self-polarizing due to the conical electrode holder. It is not designed to be disconnected while energized. A four-conductor sheathed electrical cable will be used for the power to this disconnect.

MSRE instrumentation requirements include the measurement of the level of the molten salt over a 5-in. range in the fuel- and coolant-salt pump bowls. In order to make this measurement, a level-sensing device is required that is capable of extended operation at 1200°F in an intense radiation field (γ + n + B). A further restriction is the relatively low electrical conductivity of the fuel and coolant salts.

A number of level-measuring techniques were considered; however, no presently available device was suitable for MSRE use without some development. While several types of level devices offered possibilities of successful development, the ball-float type used on the ARE and further developed by Southern+ offered the greatest possibility of success with the least development. The major problems associated with the development of the ball-float sensor are the design of the float and the design of the position-sensing coil and core assembly.

The design of the float was the first problem considered. Two types of floats are being designed. The float used in the fuel system must withstand the high temperature of the fuel salt and the still higher temperature caused by beta heating. A solid graphite float is being designed for this service. The submerged portion of the float will be cylindrical, and the unsubmerged portion will be spherical. Calculations show that the density difference between graphite and the fuel salt is sufficient to produce the desired excess buoyancy when allowance is made for absorption of fuel salt in the graphite. The float in the coolant salt will not be subjected to beta heating; however, and a hollow INOR-8 ball float can be used.

The position of the float will be detected by measuring the position of an iron core suspended below the float inside a containment tube, as shown in Fig. 35. A differential transformer located outside the containment tube will detect the position of the core through the nonmagnetic wall of the containment tube. The core will be clad with INOR-8 for corrosion protection.

The differential transformer was selected for the position-sensing device in preference to the taper-core variable-inductance sensors previously used because it is less affected by temperature; it is compatible with commercially available receiving instruments; the core weight is lower, and the cylindrical configuration of the core eliminates the need for guide bushings.

The high temperature at which the differential transformer operates presents several problems. The conducting and insulating materials in the transformer windings must maintain their physical and electrical characteristics at the exposure temperatures and radiation levels for periods longer than the longest expected period of reactor operation. Also, the inherent decrease in insulation resistivity with temperature must not affect the transmitted signal.

Silver was originally considered for the wire material, but because of grain growth of silver at the operating temperature, other materials, including platinum, permit the use of heavy-gauge ceramic-coated wire and will reduce the effect of changes in the resistivity of the insulation on the transmitted signal. Second, the available insulating materials are being investigated to determine which will best meet our needs. The usual ceramics are available, and a newer material, Flourmica, may be applicable. One Flourmica sample has been submitted to the Solid State Division for evaluation. Another sample of a different type will be submitted as soon as it arrives.

A low-temperature mockup of the differential transformer with the desired 5-in. range has been constructed and tested. A sensitivity of approximately 40 mV/V/in. was obtained. Deviation of the transmitted signal from linearity was less than 2%. The transformer consists of two single-layer windings. Each winding has 436 turns in a differential arrangement except that half the turns are wound in one direction and half in the other, with no breaks or connections in the wire. This transformer will be developed further to incorporate high-temperature wires and insulating materials, and additional tests will be made at temperature.

The fuel salt and the coolant salt for the MSRE are contained in four tanks: two for the fuel used during normal operation, one for fuel which is used to flush the system, and one for the coolant salt. The weight of fluid in these tanks is measured by individual weighing systems, which provide a continuous indication of the amount and level of fluid in each tank. With this level information available, the calibration of the weighing system can be checked if one or more fluid levels can be determined accurately. In the past, the spark-plug probe has been used to give a positive indication of a single fluid level. This device is very accurate and will provide a level indication that can be used to calibrate a weighing system.

Unfortunately, the spark plug probe has an insulator to support and insulate the center electrode, which becomes a part of the containment vessel. The seal between the metal housing and the ceramic insulator of the spark plug is not leak-tight and will not contain the gases in the system. Also, the insulator inside the container accumulates material from the vapor in the container, which short-circuits it. As there is no similar device that will provide single-point level indication, the development of a single-point probe or level device became necessary.

During the ANP program, considerable work was done on the evaluation of liquid metal level transducers. Paragraph 3. 2 of reference 26 describes a probe that was designed to replace the spark plug. This basic design is the one around which the development is centered. The probe described in reference 26 was designed to be used in NaK, which has a high electrical conductivity. The molten fluorides, on the other hand, have a very low conductivity, which makes changes in the design necessary. The original design used the change in voltage across the probe when NaK came in contact with the end of the probe to operate a relay. With the MSRE molten fluoride mixture, the change in current flow is relatively small, so a signal transformer is inserted in series with the excitation transformer and the probe. By keeping the voltage drop in the circuit external to the probe a very small fraction of the voltage drop across the probe, the small resistance change that takes place when molten salt touches the probe results in a usable signal from the signal transformer. With the present probe, the maximum signal change is about 5%.

Although detectable, this signal change is not large enough for normal use. The probe now being used consists of a 5/8-inch Inconel tube with two ceramic-bead-insulated No. 18 silver wires run down the center and welded to the contact end of the probe.

The molten-salt container in which the first tests were made with this device is being modified to make it more useful. The probe design is also to be changed. With these changes, the development program for the device will have three major phases. One will be to continue work on the probe and the associated electrical excitation and readout system. Another will be a continuation of the work done by Greene on the conductivity of molten fluorides. The third will be a program to determine the cause of what seems to be the polarization of electrical probes inserted in the salt even when excited with high-frequency a. c. voltages. This polarization was mentioned by Greene and by Hyland in his work on molten-salt level.

The core was assumed to be a single region consisting of a homogeneous mixture of graphite and fuel salt, with various volume fractions of salt. In the third set, the core was made up of fuel salt and a reflector of moderator material (graphite, beryllium, or beryllium oxide), and in some of these cases, a central moderator region was also considered. All calculations were done with the IBM-704 multigroup diffusion-theory program GNU-II.

Calculated system inventories of U-755 and critical mole percentages of uranium circulating system inventory were obtained. The effect of subdividing the core was slight. It is possible, however, to obtain a wide range of power shapes, as indicated in Fig. 2.

The control-tube-worth calculations were done in x-y geometry using the IBM-704 program PDQ with two groups. For the purposes of these calculations, the actual cylindrical tubes were replaced by square tubes of cross-sectional area equal to the cylindrical tubes. Two-group constants derived from multigroup calculations were used for the core and empty-tube regions. The full tubes were assumed to be black to thermal neutrons but to have the same fast-group cross sections as the. It should be noted that an empty tube contains fuel salt and graphite, as well as INOR-8. A total worth of 11% 6k/k was obtained for four tubes when these tubes were symmetrically placed 4 in. from the vertical axis of the core.

Additional calculations were performed using the two-group REs geometry of the tubes as a function of the height of the poison fluid. Since REs geometry was used in this calculation, the four tubes were replaced by a ring. This ring had the same surface-to-volume ratio as did the tubes. The calculational results were normalized to the 11% result obtained from PDQ. The results of these calculations are shown in Fig. 4, with the fraction of total tube worth plotted versus the fraction of the tubes filled with poison salt. A curve of the approximate tube worth obtained from elementary perturbation theory is included for comparison.

As an alternative to the present MSRE design, it has been proposed to encase the core graphite by means of an INOR-8 calandria, with fuel salt flowing through tubes. Preliminary nuclear calculations have been made, assuming the core of the reactor to consist of a homogeneous mixture of fuel, graphite, and INOR-8, with different tube thicknesses.

In the composition, the power level, cooling time, and the distance from the source to the dose point are given. Additionally, the change in shield thickness required for a tenfold change in the dose rate is specified and is applicable over the range of at least one-tenth to ten times the given dose rate. Too large an extrapolation in either direction will give a low estimate. In order to decrease the dose rate above the top plugs to permissible levels, a thicker shield or better shield material is required.

An estimate of the residual activity in the INOR-8 piping of the coolant-salt system due to activation by photoneutrons (after one year's operation at 10 MW) gave less than 1 mrad/hr at a distance of 6 in. from the piping. The photoneutrons are produced by the Be(y,n)Be reaction in the coolant salt.

Metallographic examination of INOR-8 forced-convection loop MSRP-12, which temperature of 1300°F revealed no manifestation of attack except the development of a thin surface layer and slight depletion of second-phase material below the Se surface.

The salt was sampled frequently during circulation in this loop so that chromium buildup could be monitored as a function of operating time. As shown in Table 4. 2, the samples revealed a slight increase in chromium concentration from an initial value of about 450 ppm to a level of 500 ppm after 1200 hr. Within a spread of +60 ppm, this level remained constant throughout the test. The concentrations of nickel and iron remained at 60 ± 20 ppm and 210 ± 70 ppm, respectively, during the test.

A somewhat higher rate of corrosion was incurred by INOR-8 loop MSRP-13, which circulated a fluoride mixture containing a large uranium concentration (LiF-BeF2-UF4, 70-10-20 mole %). As discussed previously, operation of this loop was terminated after 8085 hr when a pump failure and subsequent startup caused a rupture of the cooling coil. Metallographic examination of specimens removed from both heater legs and the unheated bend connecting the two legs revealed concentrated attack in the form of surface roughening and pitting to a maximum depth of 1-1/2 mils. The cold-leg sections revealed only moderate surface roughening; however, examination of the cold-leg specimens did reveal a small number of magnetic metal crystals loosely adherent to the cold-leg wall. Results of chemical analyses of these deposits are not yet available.

A sampling probe was used in this loop experiment to determine the buildup of chromium in the salt as a function of operating time. Two samples of the salt showed an increase in chromium concentration from an initial level of 160 ppm to a final level of 1730 ppm (Table 4. 3). The nickel concentration, which was abnormally high at the start of the test, decreased to a level of 100 ppm. The uranium concentration remained relatively constant during the test.

The chromium concentration when plotted as a function of test time was found to closely approximate a function of the type e^kt. Such a time dependence is typical of reactions whose overall rate increases as the concentration of reaction products increases. It is believed that the high initial nickel concentration in the salt contributed to the buildup of chromium.

Despite the initially high nickel concentration and the relatively large percentage of UF6 (20 mole %) incorporated in the salt systems, the maximum attack of INOR-8 was limited in all specimens to 1-1/2 mils. Thus, the test lends encouragement to the use of salt mixtures containing the larger concentrations of uranium required for one-region power-convertor reactors. The indication of mass transfer, however, will require further study.

Surface voids ranging in depth from 12 to 22 mils were found in the first heater leg, and from 18 to 24 mils in the second heater leg. The unheated bend connecting the two heater legs and the cold-leg sections of each loop showed some pitting to a depth of 1 mil and a relatively light concentration of subsurface voids up to 3 mils deep.

Of particular interest is the difference in depths of corrosion in the two loops. The depth of void formation in loop 9377-6, which circulated a nonuranium-bearing breeder salt with 13 mol % ThF, was approximately half that in loop 9377-5, which circulated a salt containing a small percentage of UF and ThF. Since the temperature and operating conditions for both loops were approximately the same, the results support the prediction that salts containing thorium, even in relatively large amounts, should cause less corrosion than salts which carry uranium. This prediction is based on the finding that long-term corrosion in fuel-bearing fluoride mixtures results from the reaction which is reducible only to thorium metal.

Molybdenum appears to be highly suited to this application on the basis of the first three requirements. To evaluate its properties with respect to the last two requirements, two thermal convection loops (No. 1250 and 1251) contain a molybdenum insert in the hottest section in contact with graphite and INOR-8.

Both bend tests and metallographic examination revealed the incidence of cracking, and a cursory examination of the welding procedures indicated no obvious remedy. Because of the importance of this problem, an investigation was immediately started to determine its seriousness and to develop preventive measures.

Parent plate and welding wire of the same types as those used when cracking was observed were studied in the laboratory. Highly restrained welds were prepared, and the incidence of cracking was verified, indicating that minor modifications in the welding procedure would not materially improve the situation. Further examination of these welds revealed prevalent microporosity and occasional microfissures in the heat-affected zone of the weld (in the base metal). As a result of this preliminary evaluation, the study was concentrated on both the weld metal and the base metal.

In an effort to overcome the weld-metal cracking difficulties, an experimental INOR-8 weld-metal composition containing 2 wt% Nb was investigated. This filler metal was developed in the course of the INOR-8 welding program previously conducted by the Welding and Brazing Laboratory and was considered exceptionally promising in view of its excellent elevated temperature mechanical properties. Welds made on the suspect heat of the base plate exhibited no evidence of weld-metal cracking, either in bend tests or in metallographic sections. A typical side-bend specimen is illustrated in laboratory melts of this alloy were deposited with no evidence of defects in the weld metal, indicating that use of this alloy will prevent weld-metal.

In addition to this work, approximately 175 metallographic specimens of various INOR-8 welds made over the past few years were carefully re-examined to determine whether cracks were present which had been overlooked during routine metallography. A rapid means of screening was developed (involving a sensitive fluorescent penetrant and ultraviolet light) which accurately detected the presence of minute defects without the laborious process of high-magnification examination of each sample. Any cracks that were found in this screening could subsequently be examined with a conventional microscope. As was expected and previously reported, most of the welds made on the high-boron heat of INOR-8 (Haynes SP-16) exhibited many cracks. However, welds made with approximately 10 different heats of weld wire (both commercial and experimental) which were considered to possess good weldability were resistant to cracking. A high degree of restraint was used in making the welds (parent plates were welded to a 2-in. -thick backup plate), and only one of these heats exhibited microfissures in the weld metal. Even in this case, however, the incidence of microfissuring did not appear notably more pronounced than that observed in similar welds of other nickel-base alloys, such as Hastelloy-B, Hastelloy-W, and Inconel, which are usually considered to have excellent weldability.

Studies to evaluate the microfissuring tendencies of INOR-8 parent material were concentrated on the hot-ductility test developed and carried out at Rensselaer Polytechnic Institute. The results of tests on Haynes heats SP-16 and SP-19 have been reported previously.

Cracking difficulties in the welder qualification work and the subsequent laboratory work possess poor ductility at high temperatures. The Rensselaer data for this heat of material and for a heat of material possessing good hot ductility (Westinghouse heat M-1566) are plotted in. The suspect heat of material exhibited essentially 0% reduction in area, even though both materials have approximately the same melting points. Heat M-1566 material, on the other hand, provided a 48% reduction in area after being cooled to and tested at 2000°F.

Although the results to date are inconclusive, it appears that the melting practice affects the hot ductility and weld-cracking tendency to a large extent. The investigations are continuing in an effort to determine the influence of material chemistry and melting practice upon the hot ductilities and cracking or microfissuring susceptibilities of various heats of INOR-8.

The sump-type solidified metal seal, which was described previously, failed to seal on the eleventh attempt after 10 successful prior sealings (20 individual heating and cooling cycles). The base metal of this seal was TNoR-8, and the sealing alloy was 80 Au-20 Cu (wt%). Opening and closing the seal was accomplished by direct induction heating. The required sealing temperature with this alloy was about 1700°F.

Failure was caused by a fracture in the INOR-8 base material, which allowed the sealing alloy to leak out. The failure occurred through an intergranular crack, which probably resulted from general intergranular attack of the base metal by the sealing alloy and from the severe thermal stresses set up by direct induction heating. Figure 4. 7a shows the nature of the intergranular.

It thus appears that impregnated metal-fiber compacts of this type can be operated successfully for several sealing operations. However, slight oxidation of the mating components will prevent adequate sealing, and these components must then be cleaned of oxide or replaced.

A seal of this type was attempted on two INOR-8 plates. However, after only one sealing, the alloying of the base metal and gold-copper sealing alloy was so great that the seal would not separate cleanly. Because of the requirement molybdenum by vapor deposition and is being prepared for use in another fiber seal experiment.

The specification for INOR-8 permits a maximum of 5% Fe, and when other constituents within the allowable ranges are also present, it remains to be confirmed that no intermetallic compound will occur. Also of interest are the compositional limits of the phase boundary in question to establish what deviations from specifications might be permitted.

In general, metallographic examination of the specimens showed no intermetallic compound but did reveal the presence of a fine-grain boundary precipitate occurring in the temperature range of 1100 to 1650°F. This precipitate, thought to be a carbide, went back into solution at 1800°F. Two alloys (VT-150 and VT-153) were observed to have precipitated particles, as yet unidentified, that did not redissolve at 1800°F. Both the iron and chromium content of these alloys were in the range of 8 to 10%, indicating that this may be the region of composition where intermetallic compound formation begins.

Test specimens of additional alloys were prepared that bracketed the compositions where the alleged intermetallic compounds were found in an attempt to confirm the proposed phase boundary. The alloys were decarburized by a hydrogen firing treatment prior to testing in an effort to eliminate any precipitate caused by residual carbon. Aging tests for 100- and 1000-hour duration have been started on these materials.

The allowable design stresses for INOR-8 reported previously have been revised as follows: (1) the minimum specified yield strength was increased; rates to be established; (3) the criterion for establishing high-temperature stresses was changed. Several factors led to these decisions. For instance, previous values were based on a Larsen-Miller plot of the stress to produce 1% creep strain. 1 CRU (10-5% per hour). The fractions four-fifths and two-thirds were used to avoid possible problems associated with the effect of irradiation on rupture life or creep rate. A plot of the four criteria used to establish maximum allowable stresses is shown in Fig. 8.

A program is in progress to determine the effect of notches on the stress-rupture properties of INOR-8. Rod specimens of heat SP-19 are being tested at 1100 and 1300°F in air for times up to several thousand hours. Results of the first few tests, shown in Fig. 11, indicate that specimens with a notch radius.

The technique is an adaptation of that used by C. E. Grieder at the National Carbon Research Laboratories in his studies on the location and configuration of pores in graphite by impregnating them with mercury prior to the radiographic examination.

Transverse and longitudinal thin-section samples from salt-impregnated specimens of each of the grades of graphite were taken as shown in Fig. 12. Radiographs of the samples are shown in Fig. 13. The white phase is the salt, and the gray is the graphite. These radiographs are indicative of what has occurred in each graphite specimen, but examination of more specimens would be necessary to determine whether these salt distributions are typical. The AGOT graphite was included to illustrate the differences between it and the low-permeability grades of graphite.

In general, the pipe specimens were impregnated through the cut ends rather than transversely through the walls. Presumably, little or no salt would impregnate the pipe if the ends were suitably sealed by some method such as brazing. Tests are planned to determine whether this is true.

The B-1 graphite, which had the smallest amount of impregnating salt, had the deep longitudinal crack shown at the left in its radiograph prior to the impregnation test. The small crack above it was not detected until after the radiograph was taken, so it is not possible to determine whether salt impregnation caused it. However, the overall appearance of the radiograph suggests that the small crack was in the as-received graphite.

This graphite, which was identified as a CEY type, had 5. 5% of its bulk volume permeated by the salt, which is approximately five times the maximum found for the samples of the large pipe are being sought for testing to determine whether the increase in porosity resulted simply from the larger fabrication size.

Were those for previous tests? But from a different pipe. The bulk volume compared with 1. 0% on the specimens in the earlier tests. The CEY specimens in the earlier tests had some microscopically visible cracks; those in the current tests did not, which probably explains the permeation difference.

The brazing of graphite-to-graphite and graphite-to-metal joints in air would be expected to increase the pore sizes of the graphite because of its low oxidation resistance. Since the brazing cycle is very short, however, it was thought that only a slight effect might be produced, despite the relatively high.

To determine the degree of change, the Welding and Brazing Laboratory supplied control and oxidized specimens of CEY graphite for the standard salt permeation test. The percentages of the bulk volume of the graphite permeated by. Therefore, it appears that brazing graphite in air results in some increase in.

In the preheating of a molten-salt reactor preparatory to filling it with salt, the temperatures will be lower (932 to 1292°F), but the time will be long. The above results indicate that in the preheating, care should be taken to exclude or minimize oxygen or oxidation catalysts, particularly at temperatures in excess of 752°F. Otherwise, the graphite pores may be enlarged, and the potential for salt permeation increased.

The studies by Cook, which revealed the problem of UO2 precipitation from fused salts, were conducted initially on fuels that contained neither zirconium nor thorium fluoride. It was suggested that zirconium and thorium would act as inhibitors to the UO2 formation, and tests were conducted on several salts containing these metals. It was readily shown that 5 mole % ZrF4 eliminated any precipitation of uranium. In the past six months, tests with LiF-BeF2-ThF4-UF4 (65-30. 5-4-0. 5 mole %) were conducted both in contact with graphite and in a container with no graphite present. Radiographic examination revealed precipitation within 20 hr, and the tests were concluded after 100 hr. As expected, the greatest amount of precipitation occurred when graphite was present. The precipitates were analyzed by x-ray diffraction and identified as U5. Thus, it may be concluded that 4 mole % ThF4 will not inhibit uranium precipitation. Thus, thorium is an effective inhibitor of UO2 formation when present in the salt at some concentrations greater than 4 mole %.

Standard tests of the compatibility of graphite and fuel were made with exposure for 500 hr to AGO graphite at 1300°F. A similar charge of salt was used as a control in a capsule containing no graphite. The tests were monitored by radiography at 100 and 500 hr. No additional precipitation was noted after 500 hr. X-ray analyses indicate that the precipitates appear that the usual oxygen contamination was present in the graphite and that ZrO2 was formed in preference to other possible oxides. The slight amount of precipitate in the control capsule probably resulted from chemisorbed oxygen on the inner surface of the metal container. It thus appears that zirconium is behaving as expected in preventing the formation of UO5.

Work has continued on the evaluation of various molten fluoride salts as purging agents to remove the normal oxygen contamination from graphite. As reported previously and discussed above, uranium or zirconium, depending on the composition of the salts, will precipitate as oxides from the molten salts in the presence of oxygen. A large source of oxygen in the MSRE is the graphite.

One technique suggested to remove most of the oxygen from the graphite is to purge the system with a fused salt. The usual method is to purge a standard crucible of AGOT graphite (the bulk volume of the graphite is approximately 190 cc, and the volume ratio of graphite to molten salt is 27:1 at 1300°F) with the purging salt of interest at 1300°F in a vacuum for various times. To evaluate the effectiveness of this treatment, the purging salt is replaced with LiF-BeF5UF (62-37-1 mole %), and the test conditions are repeated with exposure time as a variable. If oxygen is present, a UO2 precipitate readily forms, which can be detected by radiography.

To date, NaF-ZrF4-UF4 (50-46-4 mole %) has been the most effective purging. These precursory tests indicate that the effectiveness of purging with the NaF-ZrF-UF4 may be time-dependent and may be associated with the rate of oxygen diffusion through the graphite.

As a result of the tests that have been conducted, it appears that some benefit can be derived from purging of graphite with molten salts. Moreover, it should be emphasized that the metal surfaces, as well as the graphite, must be purged after construction of the reactor is completed; a barren-salt purge would serve to check the operation of the system as well as to clean the metal surfaces and purge the graphite.

Precipitate detectable in the LiF-BeF2-UF6. The test was prematurely terminated after 3000 hours because a small leak developed in the Inconel protective container. The leak permitted oxygen to enter the crucible, and a precipitate was formed.

In the pretreatment of graphite with the thermal decomposition products of NH3F-HF crystals, the crystals were placed inside the graphite crucible and decomposed. To determine whether the intimate contact aided the pretreatment, a graphite crucible was given the same NH3F-HF pretreatment, except that the NH3F-HF crystals were not in contact with the graphite. The treated graphite crucible contained LiF-BeF2-UF4 (62-37-1 mole %) test interval, and the test was terminated.

The pretreatment of graphite, as described in the methods above, would also require that the INOR-8 structural material of the MSRE be similarly exposed to the thermal decomposition products of the NH3F-HF crystals. Precursory tests have indicated that there is a slight reaction. These four exceptions and the use of small tabs of INOR-8 were all in an effort to concentrate the reaction on the INOR-8. Two tests of this kind were made. A layer was found on the nickel support wire. X-ray analyses of samples from the layer on the INOR-8 indicated two or more complex structures that could not be identified by the current ASTM data cards.

The first two MSRE graphite-fuel capsule experiments, each containing four capsules (ORNL-MIR-47-1 and -2), were examined in hot cells at the Battelle Memorial Institute. In these capsules, delicate bellows were used for encapsulating graphite immersed in fused-salt fuel. It was intended that the permeation of graphite by fuel and the effects of fissioning at the surface and in the pores be determined. The bellows provided a flexible wall through which a hydraulic pressure of 100 psia was transmitted to the fuel from a sodium bath in which the capsules were submerged. The flexible bellows wall was also intended to provide for the expansion of the molten-salt fuel on melting. Because of the high heat rate in the fuel, 200 W/cc, and the associated requirement for heat dissipation with the reactor at power, and because of the space limitations of the experiment, it was impossible to maintain the salt molten during a reactor scram. Of the eight capsules examined, only one was found intact. The bellows walls had ruptured in the other seven. Areas in which the ruptures had occurred appeared to be extremely brittle; in some cases, portions of the bellows wall had broken completely away, exposing the solidified salt underneath.

The one capsule having good external appearance was examined extensively. The graphite was approximately 1%, which corresponds favorably with out-of-pile tests for the same type of graphite and indicates that radiation did not increase fuel penetration. Metallographic examination of the bellows revealed small cracks radiating from the inner surface of the bellows at the base of the end convolutions. These cracks are attributed to the strain imposed on the bellows during melting of the salt. Although in one instance a crack penetrated the bellows' wall, there was no evidence of leakage based on salt analyses. Any intermixing of sodium in the fuel which may have occurred is believed to have been so slight that it did not affect the graphite.

Since the bellows wall was submerged in relatively cold sodium, the salt melted from the inside while the bellows convolutions were held rigid by the still-frozen salt within. By this mechanism, it is postulated that expansion of the melting salt on the inside strained the bellows until rupture occurred. The ruptured bellows showed considerably more damage than could be attributed to the attack by the salt or sodium alone.

The four capsules consist of heavy-walled INOR-8 cylinders, each containing a cylinder machined in the form of a boat-like cavity to contain 5 cc of molten salt fuel, in which the pyrolytic graphite and the metal specimens will be suspended.

The remainder of the experiment assembly is similar to that of the previous experiments. The capsules are suspended in a tank of sodium, which serves as a heat transfer medium. The sodium tank is a tapered cylinder with a small variable gas gap between it and a matching tapered section of the inner wall of the experiment water jacket. The gas gap is varied by moving the sodium tank axially relative to the water jacket through an externally driven screw. The total fission heat for the four capsules is 6000 W, including that of the fuel in the impregnated graphite. The total heat from all sources, including the gamma heat in the sodium tank, will be 18,000 W.

A graphite specimen from ORNL Experiment 7-2 was examined at Battelle, revealing that the surface generally appeared to be unaffected by the irradiation. There was evidence, however, of small amounts of fuel salt adhering to the bottom surface of the specimen.

Autoradiographs of the diametrical faces are shown in Fig. 2, arranged looking down from above. All evidence, from both the autoradiographs and the core-drilling tests to be described later, indicates that the interior regions of high activity were not merely on the cut diametral surfaces but extended longitudinally through the graphite. It is postulated that the graphite specimen contained planes of high porosity (visible in cross-sections as chords) which had channels to the circumference and possibly to the bottom, into which molten salt fuel intruded. Similar results were noted in the radiotracer study of the diffusion of Bu5+54 into AGOT graphite. Core-drilling apparatus.

Consisting of a Dumore high-speed bench drill and modified No. 16 hypodermic needle drills, had been previously developed for the Eu5#154 diffusion experiments. This apparatus was used to obtain samples of graphite in specific areas selected from observation of the autoradiographs. Because of the high level of radioactivity, it was necessary to conduct the drilling remotely in a hot cell.

Samples were taken along the high-activity chord and along a number of radii for the measurement of activity as a function of distance from the circumference. After drilling, the specimen was again autoradiographed and photographed. A definite reduction in total radioactivity was noted, especially along the.

The cesium ratio determined from the analysis of the molten-salt fuel is also listed for comparison. The marked difference between Cs% and Cs° distribution between the fuel and graphite indicates that the cesium diffusion is not primarily as cesium. Also, the diffusion rates do not appear to be in a ratio consistent with the half-lives of Xe-195 and Xe-157. Since the Cs-154 chain is fairly complicated, several combinations of diffusion pairs are possible. Further work on this problem is needed.

The core-drilled samples of graphite were returned to ORNL for additional study. These cores are now being analyzed more completely for fission product content, especially Sr-89790. The results will be used in an attempt to better characterize the mechanism of diffusion of fission products into the sound areas of the graphite specimen.

Consisting of a Dumore high-speed bench drill and modified No. 16 hypodermic needle drills, had been previously developed for the But52154 diffusion experiments. This apparatus was used to obtain samples of graphite in specific areas selected from observation of the autoradiographs. Because of the high level of radioactivity, it was necessary to conduct the drilling remotely in a hot cell.

Interior cores in sound graphite areas showed only one major gamma activity, that of cesium. Based on analyses of whole cores by gamma spectrometry, approximately two-thirds was Cs-137 and about one-third was Cs-135. Table 3. 2 contains the results of gamma analyses of several cores, together with Cs-135/Cs-137 ratios.

The inclusion of ZrF4 in the MSRE fuel greatly complicates the problem of providing a complete and systematic representation of the phase behavior of the system to which the fuel belongs. The problem is alleviated to some extent by similarities in the effects of ZrF4, UF4, and ThF4 and can thus be posed as a search for differences. The recently completed investigation of the quaternary system LiF-BeFs-ThF4-UF (ref. 1) and the current studies of the ternary system LiF-BeFo-ZrF4 are particularly helpful.

In the quinary system proper, two composition sections, as shown in Figs. , the first two phases to precipitate do not contain UF4 or ThF4, but one of them does contain ZrF4. As a consequence, the ratio of ZrF4 to UF4 in the remaining liquid is decreased, giving rise to conditions such that the presence of oxide results in the precipitation of UO2 rather than ZrO2. A good example of this behavior was recently encountered in a freeze-valve test involving an intentionally slow freeze to induce as much segregation as possible. All the oxide in the frozen portion, or valve, appeared to have precipitated as UO2. The amount of soluble oxide initially present, representing unintended contamination, probably corresponded to saturation with ZrO2. Actually, the analysis of a filtered sample gave 700 ppm oxide.

When the fuel freezes completely under equilibrium conditions, much of the UF4 and ThF4 appears as a solid solution in a familiar phase, whose stoichiometry, then in the equilibrium liquid, has commonly been the case for this 7:6 fuel, is 15 mole %.

The anticipation that the 5 mol% Zr, along with 1 mol% each of ThF4 and UF4 in the nominal MSRE fuel, might be approximately modeled by 7 mol% of the quaternary system obtained by combining them ternary compounds is quite enough that of prospective fuels to give the compound a predominant role in the crystallization paths of fuels or fuel models. Solid solution or substitution of ThF4 or UF4 for ZrF4 in the ternary compound does not occur.

Due to the pronounced fluoride affinity of Zr ions, ZrF4 is an exceptionally good freezing-point depressant for LiF. This factor, combined with the absence of LiF-BeF2 compounds containing less than 33% BeF2, gives rise to liquidus temperatures near 10% LiF in the LiF-BeF2-ZrF4 system that are 40 to 50°C lower than for comparable compositions in systems containing UF4 and ThF4 rather than ZrF4. Thus, the intrusion of the ternary compound was more probable because of the extended lower temperature limit of stability of the liquid state be favorably optimized with respect to the following properties, all of which are relatively low: melting point, viscosity, vapor pressure, density, and.

In a continuing study of phase equilibria in the alkali fluoride-MF4 systems obtained for CsF-ZrF4 (refs. 3 and 4), the study is hampered because the high-temperature crystal modification of the compound CsF-ZrF4 is not stable at room temperature, and because the solid phases containing less than 34 mol% ZrF4 are unusually hygroscopic and susceptible to hydrolysis.

Data on many partially studied systems are cited in a decennial index (1950 to 1960) which attempts to include all ORNL reports of fused-salt phase studies, thereby supplementing a previous compilation of diagrams that are complete or nearly so.

As part of a systematic study of gas solubilities in molten fluorides, it was determined that this melt corresponds closely to the fluoride mixture proposed as the fuel for the MSRE and is the same as that used for the recent determination of the solubility of BF3. A comparison of the solubility behaviors of the two acid gases in molten-fluoride solvents is expected to provide a basis for a better description of the liquid state of molten-salt systems.

The experimental method for determining the solubility of HF in molten fluorides has been described in connection with measurements in the NaF-ZrF4 system. The method involves saturation with HF at constant temperature and pressure. Then a portion of the saturated liquid phase is transported at constant pressure to an isolated section of the apparatus and stripped of dissolved HF by helium sparging. The evolved HF is measured by absorption in a standard solution of aqueous KOH.

Within experimental precision, the solubility of HF follows Henry's law over the pressure range studied. Results, expressed as Henry's law constants, are summarized in Table 6. 3. The temperature dependence of the Henry's law constants indicates a constant heat of solution of approximately -5. 65 kcal/mole over the temperature range studied. The entropy of solution, ΔSp, calculated for a process involving a concentration in moles per liter in the liquid phase, which is numerically equal to the pressure in atmospheres in the gas phase, is -15. 3 eu at 1000°C. The entropy of solution, ΔSc, calculated for equal concentrations of HF in the gas and dissolved phases at 1000°C, was found to be equal to -6. 65 eu. The precision of the experimental determinations shows a 1. 01% standard deviation of experimental values of K from values calculated by the equation.

A chemically compatible gas and easily removed by volatilization, much greater versatility could be achieved. Because of the relatively high neutron-absorption cross-section of boron, the volatile compound, boron trifluoride, is being evaluated for this application.

The solubilities of BF₃ were measured between 500 and 700°C at pressures obeying Henry's law and found to decrease with increasing temperature. The temperature dependence of the Henry's law constants, expressed as moles of BF₃ per liter of melt per atmosphere of BF₃, is shown in Fig. 6. The enthalpy of solution was constant, at least within experimental error, and equal to approximately -15. 1 kcal/mole over the temperature range studied. The entropy of solution, ∆Sₚ, calculated for a process involving a liquid-phase concentration (in moles per liter) numerically equal to the pressure (in atmospheres) of BF₃ was equal to.

By similar calculations, the solubility of BF3 in the molten fluoride mixture can be expressed as gram atoms of boron per cubic centimeter of melt at various pressures of BF3. The atomic concentration ratio of boron to U°5 as a function of the BF3 pressure is shown in Fig. 7 in a convenient form for indicating the regulation of the partial pressure of BF3 required to control the nuclear reactivity of the reactor. 8, for BF3 pressures of 1 atm.

Although low-solubility regions of practical interest have not been explored, extrapolations of the experimental data to lower BF pressures are not expected to be in serious error since the solubility appears to follow Henry's law. Also, minor alterations in the composition of the molten fluoride mixture are expected to give small changes. Corrosion encountered during the solubility measurements has been attributed to sulfur impurities which have been identified in the BF.

Measurements of the freezing point of NaF were made with solute fluorides selected from the viewpoint of associating structural characteristics with thermodynamic behavior. Three fluorides whose interionic distances approximate that of NaF are CaF2, YF3, and ThF4. The significant structural difference among these solutes lies in cation charge.

The results in 0. 9 conform to the well-recognized principle that the larger the cation charge of the solute, the greater the freezing-point depression. Stated differently, the stronger the electric field of the solute cation, the greater will be the attraction for fluoride ions, which, in turn, will make the establishment of long-range order (crystallization) more difficult for sodium fluoride. For the solutes studied, the deviations from ideality manifested by the trivalent fluoride are somewhat greater than the arithmetic average of the deviations for the divalent and the tetravalent fluoride.

ZnF₂ and MgF₂, as solutes, have about the same cationic size and charge. Presumably, any significant structural difference is the result of the greater polarization associated with the Zn ion. The results in point 10 demonstrate, as expected, that the greater the polarization, the greater the freezing point.

A convenient means of providing regulated oxide contents with inconsequential alteration of the solvent composition is the addition of known amounts of BeO to fuel mixtures based on LiF-BeF2. A sequence of eight mixtures was prepared in which the ZrF4/UF4 mole ratio varied from 0 to 15 and to which BeO was added in a generally equal to the number of moles of UF4 present (1 mole % in six).

After having been heated to 750°C, the mixtures were frozen, and the frozen ingots were examined petrographically and by X-ray to establish the identity of the precipitated oxides. As expected, no BeO was found. At ZrF4/UF4 mole ratios of 4 or greater, the only oxide phase was monoclinic ZrO2, while for ratios of 2 or less only UO2 was detectible. These qualitative results, coupled with related information accumulated over a period of years, led to the specification of 5 mole % of ZrF4 in the MSRE fuel as a preventive against precipitation.

The monoclinic ZrO₂ precipitated in the presence of UF₄ appears to be pure; at least, it contains too little UO₃ to be readily detected. Perceptible solid solution of UO₂ in monoclinic ZrO₂ was not mentioned in a recent investigation of the effect of UO₂ on the transition of monoclinic to the tetragonal ZrO₂ (high-temperature form); in which UO₂ is quite soluble. However, recent British work maintains that solid solutions of as much as 10% UO₂ can be prepared in the tetragonal phase.

Recent improvements in sampling techniques and analytical procedures for determining parts per million of oxide in fluoride salts have permitted a quantitative study of the oxide removal from fluoride melts during hydrofluorination and have also provided preliminary values for the solubility products of slightly soluble oxides in fuel solvents. The analytical method involves fluorination with BrFs to release oxygen from metallic oxides and subsequent volumetric oxygen; it does not distinguish between oxide ions and oxide from sulfate, hydroxide, carbonate, etc.

Initially, the experiments were directed toward checking the experimental techniques and the analytical method. Samples of melt were obtained with a dip filter comprised of a sintered copper disk, which had been welded to a small-diameter copper tube. In order to eliminate oxide contamination during handling, an assembly was devised to allow the complete sampling operation to be accomplished without exposure of the salt sample to air or moisture. This involved the use of a sealed detachable port for transporting the sampler.

The removal of oxides from 1500 g of a molten mixture of LiF-BeF2 (63-37 mole %) by sparging the melt at 700°C with a mixture of hydrogen in hydrogen fluoride (1:1) is illustrated in Fig. 11. The concurrent removal of sulfur from the same melt is shown in Fig. 12. These results show that the HF-HF treatment can remove dissolved oxides rather rapidly and further that the analytical results are reasonably self-consistent, with the possible exception of the tendency to level off at 100 to 200 ppm. Oxide analyses greater than 1000 ppm are attributed to SO4 or some form of oxygen other than dissolved oxide ion; a similar explanation, involving a difficulty decomposable radical, might account for the residual 100 ppm depicted in Fig. 11.

After the addition of approximately 0. 5 mole% UF to the mixture LiF-BeFa (63-37 mole%) and further purification of the melt with HF and hydrogen, small weighed increments of BeO were added to cause a step-wise precipitation of UO2. Measurements of the dissolved oxide concentration of the melt during the UO2 precipitation, for reasons as yet unaccountable, did not follow a step-wise pattern but rather indicated an approximately constant 600 ppm oxygen.

In an experiment to study the precipitation of oxides from a melt containing both uranium and zirconium fluorides, BeO was added in a stepwise manner to a mixture of LiF-BeF₂ (63-37 mole %) initially containing 0. 5 mole % UF₄ and 4. 0 mole % ZrF₄. The analytical results for zirconium and uranium in sequential precipitation of ZrO₂ followed by coprecipitation of UO₂ and ZrO₂ are more clearly analyzed.

Similarly, the solubility product for ZrO₂ is 7. 5 x 10^7. Somewhat different values would be expected in the MSRE fuel or at different temperatures, but a representative or sample calculation is of interest. 5 x 10^7, then an anion fraction of oxide.

For 200 ppm oxide, might be an approximate tolerance level expected for the onset of precipitation of ZrO₂. Many other results at variance with such a low tolerance level imply the existence of complexed oxide in solution, and quadrivalent cations such as Zr appear to be the most likely complexing agents.

The measurements were carried out by a buoyancy method, using a platinum bob and a thermogravimetric balance, with the fused salt contained in INOR-8 and blanketed from the atmosphere by flowing purified argon. Correction was made for the surface-tension effect of the salt on the platinum suspension wire. In spite of the argon blanket, a thin black oxide film slowly accumulated on the surface of the salt, finally causing erratic surface-tension behavior. However, the results of a second run, which was carried out as rapidly as possible with a fresh batch of salt, confirmed the first-run results within the accuracy attached to the density equation. Analytical results on the salt recovered from each run indicated inappreciable conversion of fluoride to oxide and also approximated the nominal composition within 1 wt% for each component.

Examination of 0. 15 shows that, to a close approximation, molar volume at 800°C is a linear function of the volumes of the pure components for LiF-BeFs and NaF-BeFs. Further trial calculations led to the conclusion that the contribution of BeF2 and UF4 to the molar volume can be estimated from the fluoride ion volume alone; that is, BeF2 and, at low dilution, UF4 ions appear to fit in the interstices of a fluoride ion matrix.

The density of BeF2 has been measured only at 800°C. Jaeger has measured the densities of LiF and NaF and provides equations for the temperature dependence of density. One of the main objectives of the present effort has been to test the approximation that partial ionic volumes and partial molar volumes are constant with composition in the LiF-BeF2 and NaF-BeF2 systems.

Since the molar volume of BeF₂ appears to conform to that of the fluoride ions alone, the gram ionic volume of fluoride ions is equal to one-half the molar volume of BeF₂. If such an ionic volume for fluoride ions is then subtracted from the apparent molar volume of the alkali fluorides, an apparent ionic volume for the alkali metal ions is obtained.

The application of these ionic volumes to solutions involving UF4 as a third component requires an assignment for the volume contribution of UF4. As noted by Zachariasen, for solids, the volume of the uranium fluorides can, to a good approximation, be attributed to the fluoride alone.

The agreement is sufficiently good to make Equation (4) appear useful. The third component can be considered as any quadrivalent fluoride, and a similar equation can be used for estimating the density of five-component mixtures containing alkali fluoride, BeF2, UF4, ZrF4, and ThF4. This involves only the assumption that for ThF4 and ZrF4, the volume contributions are due to fluoride alone.

Viscosity or its reciprocal, fluidity, is not a simple additive property. However, it is frequently possible to relate fluidity to composition empirically. For low concentrations of UF4 in LiF-BeF2-UF4, the following approximation might be applicable.

Estimates were made of the xenon poison fraction in a hypothetical MSRE-type molten-salt reactor, operating with an unclad-graphite moderator, under the assumption that xenon transport to the graphite is not influenced by the liquid film. The poison fraction at steady-state conditions depends on the Xe-135 concentration in the molten-salt fuel, the free gas space over the fuel, the pores of the unclad graphite contacting the fuel, and the corresponding volumes.

Xenon transport rates were considered for various combinations of generation, burnout, decay, removal by helium stripping, and diffusion into graphite. Particular attention was given to the effect of the graphite porosity, permeability, and xenon diffusion coefficient. These parameters govern the rate of xenon diffusion into the graphite.

The computations established that permeability and/or porosity reduction, coupled with increased stripping rates, effectively decrease the xenon poison fraction and increase neutron economy. At the circulation rates considered, it is unlikely that neutron economy (with respect to xenon) can be effectively enhanced through permeability reduction alone.

The first three items could result in erratic reactor operation. The last item is of importance from the standpoint of neutron economy. Research efforts to yield information for resolving these problems include studies of volatile impurity contents of graphites, molten-salt permeation of graphites (also UF4 to UO2 conversion due to impurities), effects of pore-size distribution.

An exploration of proposed methods for xenon control has been outlined by Burch. Recent computations have also been conducted by Spiewak. The outcomes of the two studies vary significantly concerning xenon control and graphite demands. The former study was based on high circulation rates and the inclusion of a sizable decay dome connected to the pump. These characteristics have been removed in current designs, resulting in heightened driving forces for xenon absorption by the graphite.

The effective porosity, as well as the diffusion coefficient for a given graphite, influences the steady-state rate at which xenon is absorbed by graphite under conditions of burnout. Low porosity and transport coefficients (diffusion and permeability) lead to low Xe° absorption rates. Figure 6. 16 reflects the importance of the porosity, €, being low in achieving a favorable neutron.

To furnish a semi-quantitative measure of the tendency of fused fluoride salts to wet graphite, capillary-depression tests were carried out with TSF graphite in contact with the quinary MSRE salt and with LiF-BeF2 (62-38 mole %). Holes varying in diameter from 1/32 to 1/4 in. were bored in graphite cylinders 1 in. in nickel containers under an atmosphere of helium. The salt was then frozen, and the levels of salt in the holes were measured.

Respectively, for the Y8- and 1/4-in. holes; these values are about twice those calculated from the capillary-depression equation, even assuming a 180° contact angle. For the LiF-BeFs salt, similar behavior was observed. The discrepancy is probably due to changes in the salt levels during freezing. In the larger holes and on the outer perimeter of the graphite, a definitely convex meniscus (contact angle >120°) was observed. Contact angles less than 90° are associated with wetting or capillary rise, while angles greater than 90° are associated with nonwetting or capillary depression.

Further measurements of capillary depression were made on the same assemblies, generally lowered by about 30%, approaching the theoretical values. The measurements were repeated after adding pieces of metallic zirconium to the salts and reheating to 600°C. The observed depressions were close to those observed with HF treatment, although earlier observations had indicated that a strong reducing agent should increase wetting.

The same experimental assemblies were then heated in open air under visually depressed or non-wetting conditions. After a short exposure to air, the external contact angle varied from convex to approximately 90° at different positions along the perimeter, causing the graphite pieces to cock. Scum accumulation produced contact angles less than 90°. At this stage, some of the 1/8- and 1/16-inch holes became filled with salt. Salt could be made to fill even the 1/32-inch holes by moving a fine wire up and down in the hole. With continued accumulation of oxide film on the graphite, the pieces sank into the salt due to the pull of the concave meniscus until the top surface of the graphite was only slightly above the salt, and the vertical sides were covered with salt. Superficially, at least, the graphite had become thoroughly wetted.

The test specimens were degassed by heating to 200°C over a 16-hour period in a vacuum, stored under helium, then again degassed in dry helium in situ by heating for 2 hours at 800°C. After cooling overnight, the system was evacuated. BF3 gas was admitted, and the samples were exposed to the experimental pressure and temperature for 2 hours. The BF3 gas in the system was removed by stripping the samples in a stream of dry helium for 2 hours. The treated graphite samples were wrapped in aluminum foil and stored in a vacuum desiccator.

Boron contents of the graphite samples were determined by spectroscopic analysis and by measurements of the neutron absorption cross sections in the pile oscillator.

The data give a mean residual boron content of 10 ppm for the graphite. Statistical analysis of the data indicates a 95% confidence level for the analytical results, which is larger than the errors resulting from inhomogeneities of the samples.

The small absolute values for the boron content, together with the lack of detectable temperature or pressure dependence, indicate an absence of any rapid reactions between BFs and graphite at temperatures up to 800°C and pressures of 3 atm under the conditions of the experiments. The small quantities of boron retained in the graphite are possibly held by lattice defects on the exposed surfaces or by chemisorption.

Methods are required for the determination of uranium, thorium, zirconium, and lithium as major constituents; iron, nickel, and chromium as corrosion products; and oxygen as metallic oxides. Uranium and oxygen are considered of the greatest importance to reactor operations. Although suitable methods are available for all these elements, considerable modification will be necessary to adapt them for use in the High-Radiation-Level Analytical Facility. The sampled fuel will, of course, be extremely radioactive, and methods of analysis must be compatible with remote-handling techniques.

A survey was made of procedures for dissolution of the fuel. Methods tested included fusion of the sample with various fluxes such as potassium acid sulfate, boric oxide, and sodium acetate; treatment with various mineral acids; and electrochemical decomposition in which the fluoride is removed by deposition on a lead electrode. At the present time, the most satisfactory method involves treatment of the sample with a mixture of hydrochloric, perchloric, and boric acids, followed by extensive fuming with perchloric acid. By this treatment, the fluoride compounds are taken into solution, the fluoride is volatilized, and the uranium is oxidized to the hexavalent state. However, any zirconium which is initially present as ZrO2 is not completely dissolved. Studies are now continuing on this problem.

An indicator ion. In order to detect the equivalence point, a potential of +400 is required. Cations that form EDTA chelates, which are more stable than Fe(II), interfere if the reaction with EDTA is rapid. Uranium and zirconium do not interfere under the conditions reported herein. Of the anions, phosphate interferes seriously, but a 1-to-1 mole ratio of fluoride can be tolerated. The coefficient of variation of replicate titrations is about 1%.

The determination of oxygen at the ppm level in the highly radioactive metal fluoride salts is being investigated. The literature was examined with reference to ways of determining oxygen. It was decided that the method offering the greatest possibility of success under the rigorous condition of extreme radioactivity, which necessitates remote handling, is the fluorination procedure that has been in use for some time for the analysis of nonradioactive materials. The equipment and procedure have been described by Goldberg et al. The principle of the method is based on the reaction of the additive compound of potassium fluoride and bromine trifluoride with metal oxides to release the oxygen in the form of a gas. In Goldberg's apparatus, the volume of the evolved oxygen is measured after the bromine trifluoride is condensed at liquid nitrogen temperatures.

Goldberg's apparatus, although effective in bench-top operation, was not considered to be an optimum design for use in a hot cell. Accordingly, an apparatus was designed and built in the ORNL shops. The apparatus consists of a nickel reaction tube, a clamshell tube furnace, a cold trap, and a 1-liter collection flask of aluminum metal, together with associated valves and tubing.

The system is sealed at all times except in the evacuated collection flask. The reaction tube, cold traps, and collection flask are connected to the system by quick-disconnect joints, which are sealed by Teflon gaskets. These joints enable all parts except tubing and valves to be easily removed from the apparatus. These parts may be reattached to the system and may be made leak-tight without requiring more than 5 to 10 lb of pressure. The reaction tube is capped before it is transported, and the cap is contained in a slide rack attached to the apparatus stand during removal or attachment of the reaction tube.

The additive product KBrF4 will be made externally and stored until needed. A sufficient quantity can be transferred to the reaction tube in a dry box under an inert atmosphere. It is anticipated that the sample will be added to the reaction tube in the same manner. The tube will be capped and transferred to the apparatus. After the apparatus has been flushed with dry helium, the valve to the reaction tube will be closed. After heating for a suitable period of time, the furnace will be swung away from the reaction tube. The system is then flushed with helium into the collection flask. The collection flask can then be closed off and removed from the cell.

Alternative methods are being investigated for determining the oxygen content of the helium stream following the release of the oxygen by the fluorination procedure. A Hersch cell is being built and will be investigated for the potentiometric measurement of oxygen in gases. Marsh has reported the successful use of this cell in connection with the DIDO program.

Because UOs could precipitate from MSRE fuel by the reaction of the fuel with contaminants in the gas blanket, the maintenance of an uncommonly pure atmosphere, gases such as hydrogen and hydrocarbons, may also be required at higher concentration levels.

On the basis of literature surveys, gettering by active metals at elevated temperatures, such as titanium at 1200 to 1400°F, has been proposed as the most convenient means of removing contaminants. In cooperation with the Reactor Division, a small facility to test the efficiency of such a purifier has been designed and is now being fabricated. Helium deliberately contaminated at a level of about 100 ppm of oxygen will be passed over the heated metal, and the effluent gases will be analyzed with a Greenbrier 9. 50 chromatograph that is equipped with a short column packed with type 5A Linde molecular sieves to permit the detection of ~1 ppm of oxygen.

Current studies are directed toward the development of more sensitive detectors so that continuous monitoring of oxygen, water, and other contaminants at concentration levels less than 1 ppm can be carried out with process-gas chromatographs. In the most promising system of detection, the effluent gases from the chromatographic columns are passed at a pressure of about 500 H through an ionization-gage tube in which the gases are bombarded with electrons.

Energy lies between the ionization potential of the helium carrier gas and that of the contaminants. Positive ions resulting from electron collisions with contaminant gas molecules are collected on a negative plate to yield a current proportional to the concentration of each contaminant in the eluted gas stream. Although this technique is theoretically capable of sufficient sensitivity, adequate response has not been achieved due to the high background from helium ions produced by collisions with electrons whose energy exceeds the accelerating potential of the anode. These high-energy electrons stem from the energy distribution of electrons emitted by the high-temperature filament. Special ionization tubes equipped with oxide-coated cathodes to reduce the energy spread of the electrons have been found to offer improved sensitivity for contaminants such as hydrogen and methane but actually lower sensitivity for oxygen and nitrogen due to the gettering action of barium evaporating from the cathode. Enhanced tubes will be designed with lanthanum boride, LaBe, emitters, or with baffle systems to exclude the evaporated metal from the collision space.

In connection with the problem of xenon removal from the MSRE, the rate of CO2 removal from water in an MSRE pump demonstration system has been followed by pH determinations. In the initial experiments, the CO2 removal rate was about 10% of the maximum theoretical rate based on the fractional volume bypassed through the stripper.

In the rate studies, the pump system, filled with distilled water, was initially charged with CO2 at approximately 1 atm by addition of solid CO2 to the circulating stream. The pH was measured frequently to determine the CO2 removal rate. The pH values were converted to the logarithm of the molarity of CO2 for plotting as a function of time as illustrated in Fig. 19. From the linear portions of the plots, approximate values for the half-life of the decrease in CO2 concentrations were obtained. Reproducibility to within a few per cent was achieved. Usually, the flow bypassed through the stripping system was 50 gpm from a total pump volume of 100 gal. Assuming complete stripping of CO2 to 85 gpm gives a minimum theoretical half-life of 0. 8 min. Actual measurements. Numerous additional trials were useful in evaluating effects of changes in.

Preliminary experimental results for the viscosity of the fuel mixture envelope on the data experimental scatter of about 40% above these minimum values were experienced. Postoperational analysis of the melt disclosed an abnormal precipitation of ZrO2. The wide variation in the experimental data may be associated with this fact.

Any conclusions at this date must be tempered; however, by the fact that there remain a number of uncertainties in the calculated results. First, the cause of the abnormally poor heat balances is still unresolved. Ratios of the heat gained by the fluid (q_p) to the electrical energy input (q_e) as high as 1. 6 have been noted. In view of this, the factors entering into the calculation of dp are being re-examined with particular emphasis on the influence of fluid viscosity on the turbine flowmeter output signal. Planned to remeasure the heat capacity and viscosity using the salt removed from the heat-transfer system. Further, the thermal conductivity will be experimentally determined; the value used in the present data analysis is.

Work with SbF5-HF solutions was undertaken on the basis of Clifford's data that rare-earth fluorides are soluble in these solutions and his statement that SbF5 is the strongest acid in HF if an acid is defined as a substance that increases the concentration of the solvated cation of the solvent (HoF). More recent investigations of the species present in SbF5-HF solutions indicated that there is an associated un-ionized compound, HaF-SbFe¢, as well as the ionic species HzF (analogous to H3O+) and SbF6-. Presumably, the rare-earth fluoride solubility results from the formation of a compound, such as La(SbFe)5, which is soluble in HF, the rare earth acting as a base. Since ThF4 is less basic, it is less likely to form such compounds.

In initial tests, HF containing about 20% SbF5 reacted with both rare-earth fluorides and LiF, as indicated by heat evolution. The compound formed with LiF was not soluble, as observed qualitatively, but that formed with rare-earth fluorides was very soluble. There was no apparent interaction or solubility with.

The solid formed by adding liquid SbF5 to an HF solution of LiF was not stoichiometric; the Li/Sb mole ratio typically being around 1. 4. This solid had several samples that were analyzed more than once. This deviation from stoichiometry may have resulted from the 3% analytical error inherent in the method, or possibly some Li sites were replaced by H3O+ from water impurity. The LiSbF5 gave a good x-ray diffraction pattern, which persisted as the hygroscopic solid absorbed water until it was nearly completely in solution. The compound was somewhat soluble in HF, 0. 23 mole or 1. 6 g of lithium per liter at the boiling point and less at lower temperatures but was quite soluble in water. The compound was purified by dissolving it in ~200 ml of anhydrous HF and either cooling the saturated solution in dry ice to precipitate a fine powdery solid or evaporating it slowly to about 10 to 20% of the original volume to produce crystals. In some cases, evaporation yielded excellent crystals, up to about 2 mm on an edge with sharp edges and corners.

Systematic extinction indicated the space group Cs°-Im. The theoretical density is 3. 83 g/cc. Structures for the analogous Tl, NH4, Rb, and Cs compounds (ref +) and for NaSbF, and NaSb(OH)₆ (ref 5) have been published, but there is an indication that some of these may have contained some water.

The thermal stability of the LiSbF6 compound was investigated qualitatively by heating the material in an inert atmosphere in nickel or copper containers. Decomposition, indicated by the appearance of white smoke when the vapor contacted moist air, was observed at temperatures from 400 to 650°C, but the volatile material was SbF5 instead of SbF6. The compound apparently reacted with the container, forming SbF5 and NiF5 or CuF5, and then the SbF5 vaporized. Decomposition occurred at lower temperatures in copper than in nickel. In some experiments in nickel, decomposition was incomplete at temperatures as high as 700°C, and the compound may be stable to higher temperatures if the reaction with the container can be prevented. In copper containers, there was some evidence of the formation of a melt between LiF, CuF5, and SbF5 at temperatures below 600°C.

Attempts to prepare the LiF-SbF5 compound by the reaction of solid LiF with SbF5 vapor were unsuccessful, although some reaction probably occurred. The SbF5 was carried by argon gas that bubbled through liquid SbF5 at temperatures between 25 and 60°C, and the LiF powder was spread in an Inconel or nickel boat in a tube held at or above 100°C. Quantitative results could not be obtained because the metal surfaces became coated with a viscous liquid layer. However, the boat containing LiF gained many times more weight than an empty boat. LiF supported on a suitable porous carrier might absorb SbF5, and perhaps some similar contaminants from gas streams, and thus might have application to the fluoride volatility process as well as to MSR fuel processing.

Attempts to purify the rare-earth fluoride, SbF5 compound by recrystallization were generally unsuccessful since it is very soluble. Evaporation of the solutions indicated that the solubility was at least in the range of 200 to 300 g of rare earths per liter. The solid obtained by evaporation or cooling of the saturated solution was a very fine particle-sized material associated with a quantity of the solution. Analysis of one sample showed a rare earth/Sb ratio of 2/9, but this solid was obtained from a solution containing excess SbF5.

Dissolution rates of carrier salt, 63-37 mole % LiF-BeF2, in stirred, boiling 90% HF - 10% H2O were fast enough that it should not be necessary to introduce the salt into the system in very fine particles, thus eliminating atomizing-nozzle corrosion problems. In two experiments, the dissolution rate was ~50 mils/hr in the first 10 min, decreasing to <10 mils/hr after some time, probably because of a layer of soft material that was left on the surface. This material had the general properties of BeFs and is probably the BeF2 remaining after LiF, which dissolves more rapidly, is leached from the salt. When the salt specimen was bounced around with a magnetic stirrer, it dissolved very rapidly, ~200 mils/hr, probably due to mechanical removal of the soft surface layer. The resulting solution was clear without any fine particles. The salt samples dissolved were capsule-shaped, 270 to 290 mils in diameter by about 700 mils long. They had been prepared by casting in a split graphite mold.

In four runs in a small steady-state fluorinator, uranium was 97 to 98% recovered consistently by continuous fluorination of a fused salt. Corrosion of the nickel container was severe in the preliminary equipment. A better equipment design and improved conditions should result in much less corrosion, albeit potentially leading to poorer uranium separation. The fluorinator, which typically held about 70 ml of salt, consisted of a 1-inch-diameter nickel tube from which salt overflowed through a 1/4-inch-diameter tube into a jackleg that supported enough salt to allow for sampling.

The salt flow rate was controlled by pressure transfer of molten salt from a reservoir through a coiled 6-ft by 40-mil capillary tube. Flows were 5 g/min with 20 psi transfer pressure, corresponding to an average salt residence time in the fluorinator of about 40 min. This method of transferring molten salts at low flow rates was satisfactory, but practical application would require operation with shorter residence times, and therefore higher salt transfer rates than could be obtained with this apparatus.

The main operational problem was that the salt failed to flow freely from the jackleg and thus backed up in the fluorinator. This difficulty was probably caused by the salt drain line being too small (1/8-inch tube) and extending into a colder zone of the furnace. It was solved by operating at temperatures as high as 700°C. The high NiFs content of the salt, resulting from excessive corrosion, may have exceeded the NiFa solubility, thus plugging the drain line, with more NiFs being formed at the higher operating temperature required to maintain the drain line open.

The two most meaningful runs were made with LiF-NaF-ZrF4 (26-37-37 mole %) salt containing 1 wt% UF4 in one case and 0.2 wt% in the other. For the first case, fluorination near 700°C with excess fluorine and with an average residence time for salt in the fluorinator of about 40 min resulted in a uranium content in the effluent salt of 100 to 200 ppm, 1 to 2% of the original concentration. In the other experiment, with the temperature in the range 600 to 650°C, the uranium content of the overflow salt was 25 to 50 ppm, again 1 to 2% of the feed concentration. Preferred conditions would include a lower temperature, about 550°C or less, and a shorter salt residence time. In general, the nickel content in the salt increased throughout a run, never reaching a steady state. Corrosion rates based on nickel concentrations were of the order of 1 mil/hr.
