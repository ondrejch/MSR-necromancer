No significant changes in design concept or in detail of any component or system were made. Design work was essentially completed, and a design report giving all engineering calculations and analyses of the systems is being compiled. The remaining design work involves primarily the incorporation of results of development work into the final drawings.

Work on the major building modifications is proceeding as scheduled, and the estimated completion date is October 15, 1962. A contract was awarded for construction work required outside the building, and this work too is to be completed soon. It consists of the construction of the exhaust filter house, the cooling towers, the underground piping, and the inlet.

Conceivable reactivity accidents were analyzed to permit evaluation of reactor safety. Most of the calculations were done using Murgatroyd, a digital kinetics program, but some analog analyses were also used. None of the accidents analyzed led to catastrophic failure of the reactor. Undesirably high temperatures were predicted, however, for circumstances associated with extreme cold-slug accidents, premature criticality during filling, and uncontrolled rod withdrawal.

Criticality and flux calculations were revised to correspond to the latest fuel composition and the detailed design of the core. Calculations were done for a core model consisting of 19 regions with different volume fractions of fuel, graphite, and INOR-8. The clean critical concentration for the reactor fueled with salt containing no thorium was calculated to be 0. 15 mole % uranium (93% U-233).

Fluxes and power densities from the Equipoise calculations were used, together with the detailed flow distribution in the MSRE core, to predict the gross temperature distributions in the fuel and graphite. At 10 My, with fuel entering the core at 1175°F, fuel in the hottest channels left the reactor at 1261°F. Under the same conditions, the peak graphite temperature was 1296°F. A low-temperature region existed through the center of the core where the fuel velocity was above average.

The nuclear average temperature, defined as that uniform temperature which results in the same reactivity as the actual distribution, was calculated for the fuel and for the graphite. Perturbation theory was employed, using coefficients from the Equipoise calculations.

Power coefficients of reactivity were calculated from the nuclear average temperatures and reactivity coefficients. This quantity, defined as the reactivity adjustment required as the power is raised, depends upon which temperature is used as the control parameter. If the mean of the fuel inlet and outlet temperatures were held constant, the power coefficient of reactivity would be -4. 7 x 10^-8 k/k/MW.

Effective delayed-neutron fractions were calculated, taking into account the delayed-neutron energies and the spatial source distributions in a one-region model of the core. For a total yield of 0. 006 delayed neutrons per fission neutron, the effective fraction in the static core was 0. 0067. With fuel circulating at 1200 gpm, the effective steady state.

Measurements were made on INOR-8 freeze flanges for 5-inch-diameter schedule 40 pipe under several different steady-state and transient conditions with both an octagonal and an oval nickel ring gasket. The following conclusions were drawn from these measurements: the flange joint design appears to be satisfactory from an accumulated thermal stress standpoint after 43 cycles from room temperature to 1300°F and higher; the thermal distortion of the flanges is small in the operating range and is not of a nature to cause the flanges to separate at the seal. Thermal cycling does not cause the gas leakage rate to increase above an acceptable level. The flange joint will not form a frozen plug in the pipe under no-flow conditions if the pipe heaters are kept on. The thermal and distortion properties of the INOR-8 flanges are superior to those of the Inconel flanges tested previously, and thermal cycling of one flange did not affect its ability to seal with a new flange.

A full-scale conceptual model of the control rod and drive unit was assembled and tested under operating conditions for over 24,000 cycles. Difficulty with a bushing was solved by replacement with ball bearings. Overall operation was satisfactory.

Evaluation of a removable 5-inch pipe heater insulated with hardboard and mineral wool indicated excellent performance, except for the tendency to produce dust after high-temperature operation. Nuclear activation analyses of insulating materials indicated that the dust would present a problem of airborne activity during maintenance. Another unit, constructed of foamed fused silica, was better with respect to dusting.

The prototype cooling bayonets for removing fuel afterheat from the drain tanks were thermally shock-tested 384 times without failure. Reactor-grade thermocouples were still intact after 6 cycles, whereas other types of thermocouples failed in fewer cycles.

Detail drawings of essentially all the components and instrumentation of the sampling and enriching system were finished, and construction of a mockup was started. The sampling-capsule access-chamber mockup passed the hydrostatic test requirements, and hot cell removal of a sample from the capsule was demonstrated.

The full-scale MSRE core model was operated at 85°F with water to make preliminary measurements of the velocity distribution, heat transfer coefficients, and solids-handling characteristics. The velocity distribution in the lower core wall-cooling annulus was found to be uniform around the circumference, indicating that the flow into the lower head was also uniform.

With the predicted values, except near the axis, where the measurements were irregular because of the random flow. Preliminary measurements of the solids distribution in the lower head indicated that solids which do remain in the core tend to collect near the drain line at the center. It appeared, however, that they would not plug the drain line.

The engineering test loop was revised to include a graphite container and INOR-8 pipe, and it was placed in operation with a newly made zirconium-free coolant salt. Information was obtained on the operating characteristics of the frozen seal in the graphite container. It was found that a salt mist existed in the pump-bowl gas space, which led to some difficulties with frozen salt deposits, but no such mist was found in the drain-tank gas space. After 1500 hours of operation with the empty container, graphite was installed, vacuum pre-treated at 1200°F, and prepared for flushing with salt that had been treated with HF to lower its oxide content.

Design and construction of equipment for opening and closing freeze-flange joints were completed, and procedure testing was started. A periscope was purchased for use with this equipment. The design of a portable shield facility for semi-direct maintenance operations is 604 complete.

The design drawings for the coolant pump, the drive motors of the fuel and coolant pumps, and the lubrication stands were approved. The assembly of the rotary element and the fabrication and assembly of the hot test stand for the prototype fuel pump were completed, and testing was started. Fabrication of all components required for the reactor pumps was initiated.

Developmental testing of an element for continuous measurements of the molten-salt level in the reactor pumps was continued. The maximum variation recorded during a four-month test was 0. 1 in. and there has been no significant degradation in performance characteristics to date.

Testing of mechanical attachments for use on radiator tubes in the MSRE was resumed after modifying the test apparatus. The differential between indicated inner and outer wall temperatures under simulated operating conditions was reduced to 9°F when the thermocouple was insulated with Fiberfrax paper and Thermom cement was applied between the thermocouple and the tube wall.

Ten MSRE-prototype wall-mounted thermocouples were exposed to fast temperature transients on the drain-tank bayonet-cooler testing facility. One thermocouple failed immediately. The remaining nine units have withstood repeated rapid temperature changes.

Results of tests of thermocouples installed on an MSRE-prototype freeze valve indicate that either 1/8-inch-OD duplex or 1/16-inch-OD single-conductor thermocouples will measure wall temperatures on the freeze valve within the required accuracy and will withstand the temperature transients inherent in this application. No significant difference in the performance or durability of the units was noted.

A six-circuit radiation-resistant thermocouple-disconnect assembly was fabricated and tested in a remote maintenance facility. The disconnect is simpler in construction than the assembly described previously and is more compatible with MSRE requirements.

Tests were completed to determine the corrosive effect of CF4 vapor on INOR-8 immersed in fuel salt at 1112 and 1292°F. Results indicate that CF4 vapor is effectively nonreactive towards INOR-8 at 1112°F, but that minor attack may be promoted by CF in the presence of fluoride salts at 1292°F.

A final design and a welding procedure were established for the tube-to-tube sheet joints of the MSRE heat exchanger. The final design provides for ultrasonic inspection. In order to demonstrate the welding and inspection procedures, a 96-joint test assembly was successfully fabricated and inspected by radiographic and ultrasonic Lamb-wave techniques. Brazing procedures for remotely preparing INOR-8 pipe joints were demonstrated by the fabrication of six joints.

Additional mechanical properties data were accumulated for INOR-8, including thermal fatigue data at 1250 to 1600°F. Stress relieving was found to improve the elevated-temperature stress-rupture properties of weldments.

Grade TS-281 graphite, considered representative of MSRE material, was found to be more porous than experimentally made samples of similar graphite; however, it met design requirements. Specimens of TS-281 were permeated to 0. 2% of the bulk volume in the standard permeation tests. Oxygen contamination was purged from R-0025-grade graphite with the decomposition products of NH4F-HF at temperatures as low as 392°F. Exposure of INOR-8 specimens to this environment at temperatures varying from 392 to 1300°F resulted in minimum attack at 752°F.

Sintering studies were begun to develop procedures for fabricating Gd2O3 and Gd2O3-Al2O3 cylinders for MSRE control rods. The shrinkage characteristics and bulk density changes as a function of green density were determined for Gd2O3 pellets that were fired at 1750°C in hydrogen.

Two molten-salt-fueled capsule assemblies, ORNL-MTR-7-4 and 47-5, were built to study the formation of CF4 in the gas over fissioning MSRE fuel containing submerged graphite. In assembly 47-4, four capsules containing a graphite core submerged in fuel and two with graphite crucibles containing fuel were irradiated.

Assembly 47-4 was irradiated from March 15 to June 4, and it is now undergoing post-irradiation examination at ORNL. The maximum measured temperature of the capsules was 100 ± 25°F during approximately 1500 hr of full-power steady-state reactor operation. Sixty of the 121 recorded temperature changes of ~30°C or more included decreases to the solidus temperature of the fuel salt.

Two capsules containing submerged graphite cores were installed in assembly 47-5 to permit gas sampling during irradiation. Additional sealed capsules designed to provide a range of oxidation-reduction levels by altering the accessibility of chromium metal to the fuel were included.

Postirradiation examination of assembly 7 revealed that elemental fluorine at pressures as high as 35 atmospheres was generated in some of the rapidly frozen salt used in tests of the effect of radiation on evolution of CF4 from fissioning fuel and graphite. The fluorine, undoubtedly of radiolytic origin, appears in the frozen salt after shutdown, and is possibly the main causative agent of the CF4 in the capsules that contained large quantities of CF4.

Freezing history of the capsule. Present indications are that the fluorine problem will not constitute a severe threat to the reactor operation. Tests are in progress to obtain direct confirmation of the evidence for a negligible concentration of fluorine in the molten.

Studies of the cleanup of graphite and of fuel continued, and efforts to improve analytical aspects of MSRE fuel technology were directed toward oxygen determinations in fuel and in graphite, and toward homogenization of radioactive samples of fuel.

A (30-38-32 wt%) mixture proposed for use in out-of-pile studies related to the MSRE was experimentally obtained. Unusual scatter in the data warranted only a linear fit of the enthalpy data. The derived heat capacity over the temperature span 475 to 715°C is therefore given by the constant value 0. 413 cal/g-°C. The kinematic viscosity was found to vary with the mixture density as a function of the temperature, allowing prediction of the absolute viscosity.

Design work on the MSRE was essentially completed. There remains only final revising of system layout and design drawings and completion of the electrical design. The design report, in which all engineering calculations and analyses of the systems are presented, is presently being compiled. Much of the design work remaining to be completed involves incorporation of development work into final design drawings. An example of such a design is the removable salt-pipe heaters and insulation. Final test evaluations of two different concepts of such removable insulated heater sections are nearing completion. Design drawings of these units must be completed after these tests indicate which type will be used.

Another item that awaits final test evaluation before the design can be completed is the control rod drive. A model incorporating all the principles has been operated successfully, and testing of an actual prototype unit will permit the design to be finished. Such a prototype is.

All layouts for the three major areas — reactor cell, drain tank cell, and coolant cell — are complete. The various penetrations into these cells have also been designed. The layout of interconnecting gas, water, electrical, and instrument lines between these cells is nearing completion.

Considerable effort was devoted to the design of the containment vessel, and all parts of this design were completed. Several methods of effecting a closure with the seal membrane that welds to the steel shell were analyzed before an acceptable concept could be detailed.

Since the molten-salt system employs electrical heat to bring all components to the operating temperature, the electrical distribution for this heater network is rather elaborate. This electrical system is about 40% designed. The heater control centers are complete. Conduit and cable-tray layouts are 60% complete. The design of modifications to existing auxiliary diesel power controls is 60% complete. All electrical designs are scheduled to be completed by March 1, 1963.

Design drawings for the charcoal adsorber system for the offgas are finished. Layout drawings of offgas piping in the reactor cell, drain tank cell, and special equipment room are 95% complete. Very little remains to be done to bring the design of the entire gas system to completion.

The design of the jigs and fixtures for the assembly of the initial and replacement components for the test cell was completed. The components, piping, and flanges are supported by adjustable supports that duplicate or resemble the test cell structure and are positioned precisely by optical tooling.

Completion of the items mentioned above will complete the design of all major equipment and facilities, including the maintenance control room, the remote crane control, the television viewing devices, and the remotely operable lifting tongs. The design of the work shield, protective environment enclosure (standpipe), tools, and operating procedure for replacing the 7/8-in. -OD graphite sampler is complete.

The Kaminer Construction Corporation, which has the prime contract for the major modifications to Building 7503, has completed approximately 90% of its contract. The estimated completion date is October 15, 1962, as scheduled. The status of the work in progress is outlined in the following sections.

The support beams for the lower roof plugs were concrete-filled and put in place. These plugs will be poured soon. The upper roof plugs were poured but were not delivered because of a lack of storage space. The seal membrane is on site.

Drain Tank Cell. All the concrete was poured in the drain tank cell, including the upper and lower roof plugs and the support shield beams. Plug welding of the stainless steel liner was completed as shown in Fig. 2. The lower roof plugs should be installed and ready to weld in the seal membrane when it is delivered.

The exhaust filter house is complete except for the installation of filters, which are expected to be delivered approximately September 15. The offgas exhaust stack is installed. The exhaust blowers, duct, and dampers will be delivered by September 1 and installed by September 15.

With the exception of the graphite for the MSRE core, materials procurement is approximately on schedule. The graphite is now promised for November 1, 1962, and efforts are being made to improve this delivery date. The status of procurement is outlined in the following sections.

INOR-8. Delivery of all plate, rod, weld rod, and pipe is complete, except for some miscellaneous pieces. Partial delivery was made of pipe fittings, and tubing delivery is approximately 75% complete. Delivery of forgings, that is, freeze flanges, heat exchanger tube-sheet blank flanges, O-ring gaskets, and other special forgings, is approximately.

Graphite. The National Carbon Company has formed, baked, and graphitized all the base-stock graphite bars. The individual lots are at various stages of the multiple impregnation treatment. All bars received the first impregnation. The delivery of the completely machined graphite bars was tentatively rescheduled from September 1 to November 1, 1962.

The fabrication of MSRE components in the Y-12 Machine Shops is estimated to be approximately 50% complete and on schedule. Delivery of the first component is expected around October 1, and all components are expected to be delivered by January 1. The status of component fabrication is described in the following sections.

The stainless steel thermal shield for the reactor vessel is being fabricated in the Union Carbide Nuclear Company Paducah machine shop and is approximately 35% complete. Delivery is expected around October 1, 1962.

Radiator Enclosure. The enclosure for the radiator is approximately 65% complete, and delivery is expected around January 1, 1963. The door-lifting mechanism was fabricated in a local Oak Ridge Machine Shop and is complete. Delivery is complete on all motors, clutches, brakes, and electric heaters for this component.

Miscellaneous Fabrication. The ORNL and Paducah machine shops are fabricating miscellaneous parts for the major reactor components. In addition, certain equipment supports, assembly jigs, and panel boards are being fabricated in the K-25 shops. The sampler enricher, charcoal beds.

The layout of the instrumentation and controls system proceeded closely in accordance with the scheme outlined in the previous report. Drawings showing the exact location of all control panels were completed, including drilling details for floor penetrations in the main and auxiliary control areas. The relay cabinet was moved to a new position, and three panels for control of the diesel generators were added to the auxiliary-board panel arrangement. Requirements for wireways between the main control area and field-mounted equipment were determined, and detail design is now underway. These wireways consist of three separate sets of 3- by 24-in. open trays. Thermocouples, signal cables, and control circuit wiring will be run in separate trays. Cable from isolated signal transmitters will be run in conduit to the nearest tray. Details for wire terminal boxes between field-mounted electrical equipment were.

Instrument Application Diagrams. Instrument application flow diagrams for the fuel sampler-enricher system, the fluorination system, and the containment system were completed and approved for construction. Nine diagrams previously approved were revised in accordance with recent design changes. A tabulation of all instruments shown on the flow diagrams, giving identifying numbers, location, function in the process, and a brief description, was completed. These will be revised periodically to incorporate design changes.

Control Panels. The design of 8 of the 12 modular instrument panel sections required for the main board was completed, and fabrication of these panels is presently underway in the ORNL panel shops. The three remaining panels, as well as the control console, will be completed when all the nuclear instrument requirements are known. A complete design for one panel section includes instrument-mounting-hole cutout drawings, pneumatic tubing diagrams, and electrical wiring diagrams. Twenty-five drawings for the main-board panel sections were approved.

Designs of three sampler-enricher control panels and two cover-gas treatment control panels were also completed and approved. Eighteen drawings were approved and issued for construction. These panels are presently being fabricated in the ORNL shops, and when completed, will be used to control mockups of these systems.

The designs of six other auxiliary instrument panels located in the field are complete. These panels serve the fuel and coolant pump lube oil systems, cooling water system, and the containment air system. Six drawings were completed. Fabrication of the containment vessel air system instrument panel was completed, and the panel was delivered. The remaining panel sections are approximately 50% complete.

Field Installations: Information necessary for the development of the electrical power system criteria was prepared. This included the safety control circuit, 45-V power distribution system, 115-V AC instrument power requirements, and remote control requirements for switchgear and motor-control centers. The design of electrical control circuitry for two 40-HP instrument air compressors was completed.

A mockup of a typical MSRE freeze valve with reactor-type thermocouples, solid-state switch modules, coolant-air system, and control circuits, was designed and constructed. Initial test operations indicate that all control circuit components will perform satisfactorily.

Data Handling. A requisition was issued for a data system to be acquired on a three-year lease period with an option-to-buy clause. Preliminary proposals from three manufacturers were received the week of, based on preliminary information and is subject to change when the final detailed proposals are received.

Process and Personnel Radiation Monitoring: A review of the process monitoring requirements was completed in May. The selection of the necessary detectors and associated electronic equipment is approximately 80% complete. Preliminary detector locations and mounting requirements were discussed. Preliminary investigations were started for the design of the two-stack monitoring systems. The instrument application diagrams now show all the proposed process monitors, with the exception of the high-level gamma monitors for the reactor and drain tank cells.

Specifications were prepared, and procurement was initiated for approximately 60% of the components required in the process instrument system. All panel-mounted instruments are either on order or on hand.

Thirteen detailed job specifications for some components requiring special development or procurement effort were completed, and procurement was initiated. These include such items as weld-sealed transmitters, valves for radioactive gas service, thermocouple material, a data-handling system, a coolant-salt-system venturi flow element, and high-temperature.

Analyses of reactor behavior in potentially hazardous situations were carried out, and the results were reported in the second addendum to the MSRE Preliminary Hazards Report. The incidents that were analyzed included fuel pump failure at high power, cold-slug accidents, premature criticality during core filling, breakage of a graphite stringer, passage of a slug of concentrated fuel through the core, and runaway rod withdrawal.

In Murgatroyd, the fuel and graphite in the core are treated as separate bodies, each with its own mean temperature and temperature coefficient of reactivity. The reactor is treated as a point; however, in that, the mean fuel temperature is assumed to be the average of the inlet and outlet temperatures. Reactivity disturbances can be represented in Murgatroyd as a series of steps and ramps, but the inlet temperature is regarded as being.

The results of a simulated fuel pump failure at a reactor power of 10 MW, with no corrective action, are shown in Fig. 1. The decrease in fuel-salt flow led to a decrease in the core cooling rate and to an increase in the effective delayed-neutron fraction, which resulted in an initial rise in the core temperatures. Heat transfer from the radiator can, however, be decreased quickly by closing the radiator doors. Results for the case of control rod action and closing of the radiator doors following the fuel pump power failure are given in Fig. 2. The control rods were considered to decrease reactivity at the rate of 0.07% per second 1 sec after power failure, and heat removal from the radiator was stopped after about 30 sec. For these circumstances, the fuel salt temperature rise was small, and the secondary coolant temperature did not become too low.

The consequences of cold-slug accidents were estimated by calculating the reactivity transient associated with the passage of a cold fuel slug through the core and introducing this transient into a Murgatroyd calculation by considering a series of reactivity ramps. The temperature rise calculated by Murgatroyd for a constant inlet temperature was then superimposed on the temperatures that would be produced by the cold slug without nuclear heating. Results are shown in Fig. 3 for two extreme scenarios. Through the core, the reactor was initially critical at 1200°F and at low power with no circulation prior to the introduction of the cold slug. Peak temperatures in the core were estimated to reach about 1600°F. The core pressure rise was not appreciable in either case.

The power excursions that would result from the continued addition of reactivity associated with such filling accidents were computed by Murgatroyd, assuming no heat removal from the fuel and using a fuel-graphite heat transfer coefficient appropriate for a static core.

In the first case, it was postulated that the fuel was concentrated by selective freezing in the drain tanks of phases containing no uranium (or thorium). With 39% of the fuel frozen, filling the core with the remaining liquid at 1200°F at a rate of 1 ft3/min would result in a 55-MW power excursion about 60 sec after initial criticality. No significant pressure surge would result.

Filling the core with salt having the normal fuel concentration and a temperature of 1200°F would produce an excursion similar to the one described above if all rods were fully withdrawn.

Rod insertion would be quite effective in preventing the power excursions in these accidents because the rates of reactivity increase would, or draining of core, temperatures in the core would exceed 1800°F; in the worst case, by the time the core became completely full.

Simultaneous withdrawal of all three rods could produce a large power excursion and undesirably high temperatures if these rods were withdrawn rapidly with the reactor initially subcritical or at very low power. In the worst case examined, the rate of reactivity addition was assumed to be 0. 08% Δk per second, and the initial power was taken to be 1 watt. A power excursion to 730 MW and a pressure surge of 19 psi resulted. More seriously, the calculated mean fuel temperature rose from the initial 1200°F to a high of 1600°F, and local temperatures in excess of 2000°F were estimated.

If a graphite stringer were to break in two near the center of the core, and the upper half could float up, the reactivity would increase by 0. 004% Δk/k for each inch of stringer replaced by fuel. If the entire central stringer were replaced with fuel, the reactivity increase would be only 0. 13% Δk/k. No power or temperature excursion of any consequence would result, even in the latter event.

An upper limit on the disturbances which could result from a fuel addition of 120 g of U235 was calculated. For this case, it was postulated that the added fuel passed through the core as a flat pancake-shaped element under normal flow-rate conditions. If this were possible and the reactor were initially at 10 MW, the power would rise to a peak of 120 MW, and the fuel mean temperature would rise by 90°F. The pressure surge would be about 2 psi. Smaller disturbances would result at lower initial powers.

The reactor statics calculations reported here are based on the current reactor design. In this connection, a two-dimensional, 19-region nuclear model of the reactor was utilized to represent the various reactor regions. Because of the limitation to two dimensions, the control rod thimbles were considered as a single INOR-8 cylindrical annulus concentric with the core center line. A vertical half-section of the reactor model showing the relative sizes and positions of the various regions is shown in Fig. 4. The boundaries of the regions and the volume fractions of fuel, graphite, and INOR-8 in each are summarized in Table 2. 1.

A fuel salt mixture containing x mole % UF4, 70 mole % LiF, (25 - x) mole % BeF2, and 5 mole % ZrF4 was considered in the calculations. The isotopic compositions of lithium and uranium were based on material compositions that might reasonably be available for use in the reactor. The calculations described below were for an isothermal system at 1200°F with no reactivity controlled by the control rods, no fission-product poisons, and no chemical impurities in the fuel.

The initial criticality calculations were made with Modric, a 3-group, multi-region, one-dimensional, neutron-diffusion program for the IBM-7090. Because this program is limited to one dimension, two types of geometry calculations were made. One was based on slab geometry, with region and material specifications corresponding to an axial traverse through the main part of the core; a radial buckling term was used in this calculation.

The other was a radial calculation, with region and material specifications corresponding to a radial traverse through the reactor midplane; an axial buckling term was used in this calculation. The two calculations agreed within 1% in predicting a critical uranium concentration of 0. 15 mole%.

The spatial distributions of the fast and thermal fluxes and adjoint fluxes were calculated for the 19-region, 2-dimensional model using an axial position that corresponds to the maximum in the thermal flux; this radius corresponds to the maximum value of the thermal flux.

Information about the space-energy distribution of the fast flux was obtained by combining the Equipoise-3A results with the results of the two Modrie calculations. Figure 2. 7 shows the radial distribution, near the core midplane, of the neutron fluxes for energies greater than 0. 1 and from the core centerline. This radial position corresponds to that of the control-rod thimbles and the small graphite test specimens. The fluxes are normalized to a power level of 10 MW.

The spatial distribution of the power density is determined by the total fission rate. About 87% of the total fissions in the MSRE are caused by thermal neutrons. The maximum fuel power density at 10 MW with no fuel permeation of the graphite is 33. 6 W/cm. The corresponding maximum graphite power density.

The shape of the temperature distribution in the reactor is determined by the shape of the power-density distribution and the fuel flow pattern. In the main part of the core, where the fuel flows in discrete channels among the graphite stringers, local temperature variations across individual fuel channels and graphite stringers are superimposed on the gross distributions. The gross distributions, which have the greatest effect on the reactor average values, are described below. They are based on 10-MW reactor operation and a total flow rate of 1200 gpm.

In describing the gross temperature distributions, only that part of the core which generates the major fraction of nuclear energy needs to be considered; that is, the central core associated with the regions designated channel, the inlet fuel temperature, the flow rate in the channel, and the total amount of heat produced in or transferred to the fuel as it passes from the inlet to the elevation in question. Figure 2. 9 shows the axial variation of fuel temperature in the hottest channel for the power distribution calculated for the MSRE. The channel inlet temperature is somewhat higher than the reactor inlet temperature because of the heat produced in the entrance regions through which the fuel must pass in reaching the main part of the core. Figure 2. 10 shows the radial variation in fuel temperature at the midplane of the core. The relatively lower temperatures in the central and outer regions of the core are caused by the higher fuel velocities in these regions. The fuel velocity in the central channels is expected to be about three times that in most of the remaining channels. Less extreme variations are expected in the outer channels.

The overall temperature distribution in the graphite depends on the fuel temperature, the graphite power density, and the resistance to transfer of heat produced in the graphite to the fuel in the adjacent channels. The internal resistance of the graphite to heat transfer produces some elevation of the graphite temperature above that of the fuel, but most of the temperature difference results from the Poppendiek effect. Figure 2. 9 shows the axial distribution of the mean temperature in a graphite stringer immediately adjacent to the hottest fuel channels.

Distribution is somewhat steeper than may be expected in the MSRE because axial heat transfer in the graphite was neglected in the calculation. Figure 2. 10 shows the radial variation of the graphite temperature at the core midplane.

Calculated on the basis that 6% of the reactor power is produced in the graphite by gamma and neutron heating, no other heat sources in the graphite were considered. The graphite-fuel temperature differences will be greater than the indicated values if fuel salt soaks into the graphite and produces a source of fission heat in the stringers. If 2% of the graphite volume were uniformly filled with fuel salt, the maximum difference between the mean temperature in a graphite stringer and that in the adjacent fuel.

In addition to the above results for the main core regions, the mean fuel temperatures and temperature rise were also calculated for a number of peripheral regions, based on 10-MW reactor operation and an average fluid temperature rise of 50°F in passing through the core. The increase in fuel temperature as the fuel passes through a region and the associated mean temperatures for the various regions are summarized in Table 2. 2.

A useful concept in relating the actual fuel and graphite temperature distributions to the total reactivity is the nuclear average temperature. This quantity is defined as follows: At low power, reactor criticality is assumed to be established at isothermal temperature conditions in fuel and graphite.

See Table 2. 1 and 2. 4 for the location and composition of regions. Only regions which contain fuel are the reactor volume. In the definition of G(r, z), g, Bo, G, and $f are the fast and slow fluxes, and the fast and slow adjoint fluxes, respectively. The G's are constant coefficients for each region of the reactor in which the composition is uniform and are related to the macroscopic two-group nuclear constants.

Since axial heat transfer in the graphite was neglected, any heat produced in the graphite was considered transferred to the fuel immediately adjacent to it. As a result, the gross fuel temperature distribution was unaffected by fuel permeation. It was assumed that the shapes of the temperature-weighting functions were also unaffected so that the different degrees of fuel permeation did not produce any change in the fuel nuclear average temperature.

Consistent with the definition of the nuclear average temperatures, importance-averaged temperature coefficients of reactivity for graphite and fuel were calculated. The equations for the coefficients were based on first-order perturbation theory and involved the function G(r, z) given.

The differences in the results from the two methods are small and well within the probable error associated with the value of the temperature coefficient of expansion of the salt. The coefficients from the homogeneous model do depend strongly, however, on the correct choice of effective reactor size. These calculations also account for the effect of the salt temperature on fast-neutron leakage. Taking this into account has the net result of increasing the fuel coefficient slightly relative to the graphite.

The power coefficient of reactivity is defined here as the amount of reactivity resulting from nuclear heating that must be compensated by control rod motion per unit increase in power. This may be calculated from the relations between nuclear average temperatures, fuel inlet and outlet temperatures, and reactivity coefficients.

In obtaining power coefficients of reactivity, three cases were considered: (1) the fuel outlet temperature was held constant as the power was raised to 10 MW; (2) the mean of the inlet and outlet temperature, T, was held constant; and (3) the outlet and inlet temperatures were allowed to vary to maintain criticality with no control rod motion.

Fuel circulating at 1200 gpm spends 9. 4 sec in the core and 16 sec in the remainder of the loop. Consequently, a large fraction of the longer-lived delayed neutrons will be emitted outside the core and effectively lost. Furthermore, the distortion of the source distributions that will result from the transport of the precursors will increase the leakage probability for the neutrons emitted in the core. The reduction in the contribution of Bγ, the delayed neutrons of group i, to the chain reaction would have a strong effect on the reactor kinetic behavior. Instead, they use the neutron and precursor equations for a non-circulating system, with values of Bγ adjusted to allow for losses resulting from circulation. Thus, the use of these programs requires previous evaluation of effective Bγ values.

In steady-state operations, the spatial distribution of the delayed-neutron source was calculated for each group based on the precursor production distribution. This distribution was assumed to follow the fundamental mode of the neutron flux, considering the transport of the precursors prior to their decay. The core was treated as a single region with a uniform fuel volume fraction and velocity matching the averages for the actual MSRE channel through the core. The densities, normalized to one fission neutron per unit volume of fuel salt, applied to a channel where the flux equaled the radial average. The ratio of the nuclear importance of a delayed neutron to that of a prompt neutron was determined as the ratio of the appropriate nonleakage probabilities.

H is the height of the reactor; L is the thermal diffusion length, and Ty is the Fermi age for delayed neutrons of the ith group. The age, Ts, was reduced from that for prompt neutrons to allow for the lower initial energy of the delayed neutrons. When the fuel is not circulating, this effect enhances the importance of the delayed neutrons by reducing the nonleakage probability.

Preliminary results were obtained from a new reactor kinetics program, Zorch, in which an approximate account is taken of the space dependence of fuel and graphite temperatures. This is an improved version of the Murgatroyd program used in previous studies. In the Zorch calculation, the reactivity was related more realistically to the temperature profiles by using the concept of nuclear average temperatures. During an excursion, the axial power-density shape was assumed to be that of the fundamental mode, that is, sin nz/H. The axial temperature profile was recalculated at each time step, taking into account energy production, transfer, and transport.

Results of calculations for the MSRE with fuel containing 1% thorium were obtained for a test case in which one dollar of reactivity was added instantaneously (Bopp was assumed to be 0. 0034). The initial power level was 10 MW. The maximum rise in the fuel nuclear average temperature was 96°F. This was about 4°F higher than the maximum rise in the fuel mean temperature computed in the Murgatroyd program. The maximum power level calculated with the Zorch program was 78 MW, as compared with 107 MW from the Murgatroyd.

As an option in the Zorch program, the temperature profiles in fuel and graphite at specified time steps may be plotted using the Calcomp digital plotter. 16. The change in the fuel temperature with time following the reactivity insertion is indicated in Fig. 17.

A pair of INOR-8 freeze flanges for 5-inch-diameter Schedule 40 pipe was installed in the freeze-flange-seal testing facility for measurement of thermal distortion and gas leakage during high-temperature operation. Following the successful completion of this series of tests, each of the two flanges was mated with new INOR-8 flanges and placed into actual salt service. The several tests are described below.

The flanges mounted in the seal-testing facility were thermally cycled in air, and precise measurements were made of flange dimensions and of helium leakage at the ring-joint seal. This preliminary testing consisted of 10 cycles from a cold condition to a hot equilibrium condition. The equilibrium temperatures were varied at 100°F intervals from 800 to 1400°F. Heat was provided by 12 silicon carbide heating elements in the bore of the flange and by removable pipe heaters along the exterior of the flange adaptor, beginning 2 1/2 in. from the flange faces.

At a bore temperature of 1400°F, the radial position of the freeze point was 7. 1 in. , which is believed to be satisfactorily far from the ring-gasket radius of 10. 4 in. The average decrease of the freeze-point radius was 11/16 in. for each 100°F decrease in bore temperature.

The external thermal distortion of the 5-in. Inconel flanges tested previously. The flanges differed only in material and bore diameter. The INOR-8 flanges operated cooler than the Inconel flanges, as shown in Figure 3. 1. The distortions under equilibrium conditions are given in Table 3. 1. Starting with equilibrium bore temperatures of 1300 and 1400°F, all power to the silicon carbide heating elements in the INOR-8 flanges was cut off to produce a transient simulating a salt dump. When the bore temperature reached 850°F, the maximum external distortion was 6 mils, indicating that little distortion is induced during temperature transients. This limits the amount of frozen salt that could be trapped between the flange faces during a rapid cooldown and which could lead to permanent flange distortion. No permanent distortion was noted at the outside of the flanges. Upon opening the flange joint, however, the inner faces were found to be slightly convex; the axial displacement of the center of the bore was 1 mil.

Two nickel ring-joint gaskets were tested. For the first five cycles, an oval ring gasket was used; for the second five cycles, an octagonal ring gasket was installed. Indicated leakage, with the buffer space evacuated, was very low at all times. There was a tendency for the leak rate to increase as the number of cycles increased and to decrease at higher temperatures. Leak rates at the outside of the buffer groove were consistently higher than the leak rates to the bore through the inner seal of this buffer zone.

Specifically, for the oval ring, the cold leak rate steadily increased initially with no detectable leakage at high temperatures, but after five cycles, the total leak rate was 1. 5 x 10-9 cm3/sec at 1200°F. For the octagonal ring, the initial cold leak rate was 8. 6 x 10-6 cm3/sec. 0 x 10-7 cm3/sec at 1300°F. For this brief period of testing, the performance of the octagonal ring was superior to that of the oval ring, but both performed far better than required.

Immediately following the preliminary testing in the seal test facility, one of the tested flanges was paired with a new flange, and the pair was installed in the thermal-cycling facility. The flange testing consisted of thermal cycling and attempts to form a frozen salt plug at the flange bore.

Forty-three cycles have been completed to date. A cycle starts with the flange bore at ambient temperature, and the sump and pipe temperatures held constant. The freeze flange is then preheated until temperature equilibrium is reached (about 8 hr) at a bore temperature of 650°F. The total cycle requires approximately 22 hr to complete. The first 15 cycles were made.

The size of the salt ring was predicted on the basis of the flange temperature distribution shown in Fig. 2 as obtained during cycle No. 35, and the expected 20°F temperature difference between the external and internal flange faces, which was noted in earlier tests.

Two mechanical dial indicators mounted on a small lathe bed were employed to measure thermal distortion of the flanges. With the flange bore at equilibrium at 1250°F, the maximum combined thermal expansion and distortion was 25 mils. No permanent distortion of the outer flange faces was detected in the cold flanges after.

There was a small increase in the interior face warpage of the female flange from the initial out-of-flatness of 14 mils to 18 mils after 36 cycles. No warpage was detected on the male flange face. After 36 cycles, all bore dimensions were checked and found to be undersize. The female bore decreased by 10 mils, the male bore by 30 mils, and the male.

For the first 36 cycles, an octagonal seal ring was used. The initial cold seal leak rate for the ring was between 10^-7 and 10^-3 cm3/sec. After the flange joint had reached its initial hot equilibrium temperature (1020°F), the hot leak rate was less than 5 x 10^-9 cm3/sec.

In order to simulate a pump failure, the salt was held in a stagnant condition between the two sumps to determine whether a freeze plug would form at the flange bore. In the most severe test, the piping was kept heated at 1000°F. Although the flange bore temperature was reduced to 350°F under these conditions, only a partial plug formed. It was concluded that the MSRE 5-inch pipe flanges would not plug so long as the pipe heaters were operative.

The second INOR-8 flanged joint was installed in the pump testing facility (described later in this chapter) with an oval ring-joint gasket. To date, the facility has been operated for approximately 300 hours with three complete cycles from startup to shutdown. The temperature distribution of the flanged joint has closely approximated the distributions measured in both the seal testing facility and the thermal cycle test loop. No distortion has been noted, and no leak rates greater than 5 x 10^7 cm³/sec have been detected with the buffer seal system of this joint. The buffer type of seal system used is similar to the reactor leak detection system. Although the test results are encouraging, additional experience is needed before the current freeze-flange design is.

A full-scale model of one MSRE control rod and drive was assembled and operated over a range of temperatures from 500 to 1300°F. The drive is shown in Fig. 4. The unit has operated through 24,473 cycles (56 3/4 in. full travel in each direction). The rod has been dropped from various heights 862 times.

While overall operation has been satisfactory, the drive unit failed when one of the lower idler-sprocket bushings galled as a result of a foreign particle. This bushing was replaced with a shrouded ball bearing, and operation was resumed. Tests indicate that the rod position is known.

Testing of removable hardboard-insulated heaters for 5-inch pipe was completed. The units operated a total of 6136 hr with a pipe temperature under the heaters of 1400°F. The average power input was 520 watts per linear foot of heated pipe. The overall functional operation of the heaters was excellent, but the hardboard exterior tended to crack and dust, the soft mineral wool lining dusted after heating, and the metal liner warped. Three alternate designs being considered to overcome these objections consist of units made with blown fused silica (Glasrock Mfg. Co. ), reflective metal insulation (Mirror Mfg. Co. ), and combinations of these materials. The materials for use in the MSRE will be selected after tests of the various combinations.

Testing of two prototype heater boxes using the Glasrock material indicated an excessively high heat loss of 700 watts/ft. The surface temperature of the heater boxes was 240°F when the heaters were operated at 1000°F. This would lead to excessive heat losses in the MSRE cell. Furthermore, the material is unable to withstand physical abuse without cracking or chipping. On the other hand, it has the lowest coefficient of expansion.

Most high-temperature insulation materials will dust to some extent, and the dust will present a problem in reactor maintenance if it is highly activated. The insulating materials listed in Table 3. 2 were, therefore, tested for activation following irradiation for 16 hours at a neutron flux.

The prototype cooling bayonets for removing afterheat from fuel in the MSRE drain tanks were thermally shock-tested 38 times without failure. The test system was then shut down for installation of prototype thermocouples on the 1-in. cooling bayonets that slide into the 1 1/2-in. thimbles in the salt pool. In previous operations, thermocouples installed in this area came loose in a few cycles. The reactor-grade thermocouples now being tested are intact after 6 cycles and 48 hours of exposure at 100°F.

A carbonate salt is being used in place of the MSRE fuel salt in these tests to avoid beryllium-handling problems. The carbonate consists of 1200°F. The properties of the carbonate salt at 1200°F are given below, along with those of the fuel salt, for comparison.

Drawings of nearly all the components of the sampling and enriching system were issued for comment. Detail drawings of the transfer tube and the spool piece between the disconnect flanges, with its positioning tool, were approved for construction. Instrumentation flowsheets and panel layouts were also approved for construction.

A full-scale mockup of the sample transfer box (area 3), the drive box (area 1e), and the operational valve is being fabricated for installation on the Engineering Test Loop. The transfer tube, which had to be shortened to fit into the space available, has bends and slopes that are the same as those to be used in the reactor system.

The mockup will be used to demonstrate that each component operates satisfactorily and to develop adequate sampling and enriching procedures. The sampling-capsule access-chamber mockup was successfully hydrostatically tested at 90 psig to check the tightness and strength of the access port. The copper sampling capsule was modified to simplify handling, and remote removal of a sample from the revised capsule was demonstrated.

The peak resultant velocities at the bottom of the core-wall cooling annulus were measured at various flow rates as a function of the angle. As can be seen, the velocity profile is flat, indicating that the flow entering the lower head from the annulus is distributed uniformly. Based on the observed resultant velocity of 4. 55 ft/sec and the known axial velocity component of 2. 15 ft/sec at 1200 gpm, the average tangential velocity component is 4. 04 ft/sec at the bottom of the core annulus.

A discrepancy was observed between the flow in the one-fifth scale model and the full-scale model. In the one-fifth scale model, the flow in the lower head was observed to have a large rotational component, whereas, in the full-scale model, the flow was observed to be almost purely radial. off the head. With this change, the measured heat transfer coefficients at the center line of the one-fifth.

As a check on the water heat transfer coefficient, the fluid velocity profile next to the wall was measured. At the same point, the coefficient was flat-plate geometry, and the distance between plates is twice the distance from the wall to the point of peak velocity.

Heat meter. These attempts were unsuccessful because there was no predominant direction of flow at that position; rather, the flow was gusty. The flow was first in one direction and then another. It was determined that the heat transfer coefficient would be lower than at a radius of 17 in. , but the exact value was not obtained.

Experiments were run to obtain data for use in predicting the behavior of solid particulate matter in the fuel salt, especially its tendency to settle out in the reactor vessel lower head. The experimental procedure consisted of injecting 3 lb (1362 g) of sized iron filings into the model inlet during operation. After the solids were added, circulation of water was continued for various periods of time (0 to 8 hr). As far as the solids were.

In the case of the fine solids, there appeared to be some tendency for sediment to form during their first pass through the core. Additional running time caused them to be picked up, however, and swept out. In the case of the coarse material, a larger fraction settled out on the first pass through the core, and very little was removed with additional pumping.

The 150-mesh solids that remained in the lower head appeared in a concentrated pile near the drain line. On the other hand, the 60-mesh solids, as shown in Table 3. 3, left larger amounts of sediment that tended to form a torus around the drain. These larger piles were 2 to 3 in. wide and from 1/2 to 1 in. thick, and they were against the drain line on one side. The results of these tests indicate that the MSRE drain line will not plug as a result of sedimentation of solids. Although no sedimentary materials are expected in the reactor, these experiments provided confidence in the design.

The engineering test loop was modified to include a graphite container in the salt-circulating loop, and most of the Inconel pipe was replaced with INOR-8 pipe. The loop was then placed into operation without graphite in the graphite container. Most of the previous zirconium-containing flush salt was removed, and the drain tank was flushed with newly made coolant salt. Information was obtained during 1500 hr of operation on the operational characteristics of the graphite-container access joint, on the chemical analysis of the salt being circulated, and on the formation of salt deposits above the liquid level.

After receipt, inspection, and cleaning of the graphite to be tested, the loop was shut down for the installation of the graphite. Also, as part of the proposed graphite treatment procedure, the flush salt was treated with HF and He in the drain tank to lower its oxide content before it contacted the graphite.

The flush salt was circulated at 50 to 70 gpm and 1200°F through the loop, and the graphite container while awaiting delivery of the ETL graphite from the vendor. -diam INOR-8 pipe positioned vertically in the loop, has a flanged closure that incorporates a frozen-salt seal to prevent contact of molten salt with the conventional metal oval-ring seal. This closure is similar to a slightly larger one that will be used in the MSRE. A seal of this type between graphite and metal was tested previously.

The seal was made and broken three times, and it was leak-tight during 1500 hours of operation. Since gas is trapped in the annulus during filling, either initial evacuation or later over-pressure or venting must be used to force salt into the cooled region. On the ETL closure, the gas was partially vented after the loop was filled.

An interesting observation made while determining the minimum cooling air required for the seal was that when the cooling air flow was reduced below the critical value, the salt plug moved upward. However, instead of moving uniformly around its circumference, in which case gas compression would have limited its travel, the salt extended upward in one semi-molten sector that was contained within frozen salt at the edges. This characteristic precludes the use of trapped-gas compression for preventing salt from reaching the metal oval ring unless the entire joint is held at temperatures above the salt melting temperature. The temperature distribution and a diagram of the closure are shown in Fig. 7.

In order to remove as much of the ZrF from the system as possible, the original flush salt was removed. The freeze valves were purged, and new salt was introduced into the unused drain tank (previously designated the fuel drain tank). Salt samples were removed from the pump while in.

Operation and from the drain tanks when the loop was drained. Chemical analyses of the salt samples indicated that the zirconium content was reduced from about 90,000 ppm at the end of the previous run to 500 to 1600 ppm. In comparison, dilution of 1 wt% MSRE fuel salt into the flush salt would result in 945 ppm zirconium.

An investigation was made of the oxygen pickup in the salt as a result of contact with loop-metal oxides. To simulate the expected condition of reactor components after heat treatment, the INOR-8 loop and container were heated to 1300°F and held for 12 hours with an oxygen-contaminated cover gas. The loop was then filled with flush salt, and samples were taken for oxide analysis. No increase in salt oxygen concentration was detected. This is consistent with the expected increase of less than 1 ppm based on weight gain of INOR samples that had received similar treatment.

The results of oxygen analyses during loop operation are presented in Section 8. There is considerable scatter of the data, but no definite increase of oxide content is detectable. The loop was opened between operating periods at 800 to 1100 hr, but it was purged and held at a low bake-out temperature (220°F) before refilling.

Because the small amount of zirconium in the flush salt is believed to have lowered the oxide solubility to an unknown limit, the salt was treated with HF to assure oxygen nonsaturation before operation with the graphite. The first treatment (July 1962) of 74 hr with HF removed 42 g of oxygen, equivalent to 1/75 ppm in the salt. Samples taken several days later, however, indicated that the oxygen content had increased to the original level. While awaiting further samples and to cover the possibility of the oxide having precipitated and been relatively inaccessible to the HF, the treatment was repeated in August. The second HF treatment lasted 38 1/2 hr and removed only 9. 5 g, or 40 ppm, of oxygen from the salt. Although this quantity of oxygen was higher than expected, the actual rate of oxygen removal at the end of the treatment period was approximately 1/10 of the maximum rate near the beginning of the period. If there were oxide solids left in the bottom of the tank, it could mean that the dissolving rate was very low during the 400 hr between treatments. Another source of contamination is a small unknown amount of oxygen that was admitted to the tank during the introduction and removal of the dip tube used in the HF treatment. Further study will be made of the effect of this source.

The rate of corrosion of the container walls by the HF was apparently greater than during the treatment performed in the other tanks in November 1961. There was a negligible increase in the salt chromium content during the operation of the largely INOR-8 system, which is to be compared with the chromium content increase from 100 to 200 ppm during HF treatment of salt in the Inconel drain tank. Considering the amount of tank surface exposed to the salt, the weight of salt treated, and the number of hours of treatment, the removal of chromium is equivalent to tanks of the MSRE are expected to be more corrosion-resistant.

Some difficulty was experienced during the operation of the loop with the plugging of the pump offgas line. Examination after the first 788 hr of operation revealed a collection of salt at the junction of the unbaffled baffled gas-inlet line; there was a small, but unobjectionable, ridge of salt. A salt deposit that was of concern appeared 6 in. above the liquid level in the capsule stop area of the sampler-enricher guide tube. Cold fingers were therefore.

A 1/8-inch-diameter copper tube sealed at one end was inserted into the pump bowl gas space and positioned 1 inch above the liquid level. The tube was air-cooled internally for a period of 89 hours while the pump was turning at 900 rpm in salt at 1100°F. The extent of the salt deposit, which was distributed uniformly around the circumference, is shown in Fig. 9. The deposit was examined petrographically and found to be.

2LiF + BeF2, the composition of the salt mixture, was circulated. A similar cold finger was inserted into the quiescent atmosphere of the drain tank, respectively. Both tubes had a thin deposit which was scraped off, examined by X-ray diffraction, and determined to be 90 to 95% BeF2.

A cylindrical shield of sheet Inconel was then inserted into the sampler guide tube so that it extended below the liquid level, and a 1/16-inch-wide longitudinal slit was positioned away from the pump impeller to prevent liquid salt from being forced up into the shield. Examination of the sampler guide tube again after 740 hours of operation revealed no salt deposit in the capsule stop area.

Of five stringers, complete with INOR-8 lifting knobs, plus 16 other partial elements forming 16 flow channels; several miscellaneous graphite and metal samples were attached to the graphite hold-down section of the freeze-joint plug. The graphite (approximately 60 kg total) was dusted with a vacuum brush and weighed before installation.

The container, pump, and loop were then sealed and evacuated at room temperature to 130 mm Hg through liquid-nitrogen-cooled traps for 24 hours. The total weight gain of the cold traps was 10 g. The system was then pressurized with helium and heated. 5 g.

The dry box described previously was positioned over the graphite container following the cooldown. After the dry box was evacuated, leak-tested, and purged with dried argon, the container was opened, and graphite samples were removed for various types of oxygen analysis. The analytical results, as well as the results of analyses of as-received material, will be reported at a future date.

Maintenance of the MSRE will be accomplished, as discussed previously, primarily with semi-direct methods. Remote methods will be used for operations which require large openings in the shield and produce radiation levels so high as to preclude occupancy of unshielded areas near the reactor cell. Almost all the in-cell operations will be performed semi-directly with long-handled tools operated through bushed holes in the portable maintenance shield. Viewing will be provided by special lights, windows, and periscopes. Moving shield blocks and large pieces of equipment into or out of the cell will be done remotely from inside the shielded maintenance control room, using the overhead crane system with direct and television monitoring. Design and development of the in-cell equipment, the portable shield, and the maintenance tools and development of the techniques for their use have proceeded simultaneously in order to produce a coordinated system. A procedure that outlines the steps necessary to accomplish a representative maintenance task was prepared.

And two ears welded on the horizontal centerline of the flange will remain in the reactor cell, attached to the clamps. This framework will serve to center the clamps, eliminate tilting during disassembly, and simplify the maintenance tools. When the clamps are driven off, they will be stored on an installed bracket by a hook-type handling tool.

Flange alignment will be affected by a system of jacks, hooks, and brackets installed in the cell, and each flange will require custom installation. The equipment has been designed, and a prototype system will be built and tested. The long-handled tools for adjusting the system.

A tool to handle replacement gaskets was designed and constructed, and the complete gasket installation procedure was successfully tested.

Design work is nearing completion on a portable maintenance shield to provide the MSRE with a facility for shielded semi-direct maintenance operations. The shield is designed to temporarily replace any two adjacent lower roof plugs over the reactor or the drain tank cells. A series of built-in tool access ports provide space for multiple maintenance operations.

The portable shield assembly consists of four basic components: slide, modules, frame, and track. The slide dimensions are 8 1/2 or 13 ft long by 5 ft wide and consist of three layers of 1-in. -thick steel plate welded together to a total thickness of 12 in. of shielding. The slide includes a circular cutout that accommodates a 35-in. -diameter plug. The plug, in turn, includes a series of small cutouts that provide access for various lights, windows, and tools. Another cutout, at one end of the slide, borders the eccentric plug of an adjacent module attachment, as well as a removable crane access module.

This plug-within-plug arrangement provides necessary reach to permit tool access over any point within the block opening. The hole layout within the inner plug permits multiple access to the reactor freeze flange, as specifically required for flange maintenance and for optical positioning and alignment. The plugs are manually gear-driven to allow precise positioning of their multiple openings. Pneumatic socket drivers may also be employed for driving the gears. The modules and plugs are fabricated from 12-in. -thick carbon steel.

The frame, constructed of heavy steel plate, serves as the support for the slide. After the frame is installed over a lower roof plug, the slide is moved to an end track to permit the removal of the concrete plug. An opening 52 by 127 in. is provided. The slide is then returned to position over the cell opening to provide complete shielding for personnel. A 3/4-hp motor and gearbox combination mounted on the frame moves the slide through a rack-and-pinion arrangement. The rate of travel is about. Motor controls are connected to the maintenance control room operating station with a cable.

As many as eleven 150 W lighting fixtures can be mounted in special plugs provided in the slide and the modules for special illumination of the work area. All work holes are designed with stepped split inserts to accommodate tools of various diameters. Some inserts include a drilled lead ball through which tools may be swung into positions other than directly underneath the work hole. Three 8-in. -diameter lead-glass windows may be mounted simultaneously for direct viewing. Periscope and television camera openings are also available.

Joint was made in a mockup of the drain cell with all the work accomplished remotely, as it will be done in the MSRE. Another was made on a pipe in which molten salt had been circulated, and in which some salt remained. All six joints were subjected to a hydrostatic test, a helium leak test, and ultrasonic inspection. None evidenced any leakage, and all indicated adequate bonding. The development work on the joint and methods for its remote fabrication is considered to be complete.

The design of the overflow-line disconnect at the fuel pump POWL29 was completed, and a carbon-steel prototype was built for testing. The disconnect is essentially a ring-joint flange mounted in a vertical line with a cylindrical baffle extending downward into the pipe to trap gas next to the ring gasket.

A series of tests of the prototype at 1000°F and 70 thermal cycles, with heat applied both internally and externally, indicated favorable temperature distribution and excellent leak tightness. Therefore, an improved INOR-8 prototype flanged joint was built and installed in the freeze-valve test loop.

The design of the fuel pump was approved as previously reported, and fabrication of the pump tank is approximately 30% complete. An INOR-8 volute casting was weld-repaired to the required quality for reactor service, and a spare volute casting is being weld-repaired to the same quality.

The design of the coolant pump was completed and approved. The coolant and fuel pumps are similar in design, except that the hydraulic characteristics are different, and the coolant pump tank does not contain the xenon-removal spray and the cooling shroud for the upper shell of the tank used in the fuel pump.

The design of the lubrication stands was completed and approved. Two stands will be required: one for the fuel pump and one for the coolant pump. The lubrication systems are designed to lubricate and cool the pump-shaft bearings and seals and to transport heat from the shield plug and the upper tank structure. The two stands will be interconnected to provide time for an orderly shutdown of the reactor in the event one of the systems should become inoperative.

Each stand provides a water-cooled reservoir, two centrifugal pumps in parallel, a full-flow oil filter, and the necessary valves and instrumentation to ensure adequate lubrication and cooling of the reactor pumps. The fabrication of the stands is approximately 4. 0% complete.

The test lubrication pump has circulated a turbine-type oil after the initial test of 1428 hours. The motor failed after operating an additional 913 hours when one phase of the stator winding became grounded. The stator was replaced, and testing was resumed.

The design of the drive motors for the reactor pumps was completed and approved. The basic design consists of a totally enclosed, water-cooled, explosion-proof, NEMA design B, special-purpose, squirrel-cage induction motor. The motor for the fuel pump is rated 75 hp at 1200 rpm, and the motor for the coolant pump is rated 75 hp at 1800 rpm.

The specification for the drive-motor containment vessels requires that the vessels pass a mass spectrometer leak test with a helium leak rate of less than 1 x 10-8 cm3 (stp)/sec. The vessel fabricator has experienced difficulty acquiring acceptable plate material. A second order of the material failed to pass the impact test requirements and is being heat-treated prior to retesting.

Two freeze flanges, one of which is of the MSRE design; a section of MSRE pipe heater; the cooling system for the upper shell of the fuel pump tank; the nozzle for the sampler-enricher (not shown); the bubble-type liquid level devices (not shown); and a thermocouple installed in a well for comparison with thermocouples attached to the external surface of the pipe.

Hydraulic performance data were obtained with the 13-in. -diameter impeller at 1200°F on three different system resistance lines at speeds ranging from 600 to 1150 rpm. While data were being taken on the last and steepest resistance line, the pump shaft seized along the lower 4 inches of the shield plug.

The seizure, which was of the friction-weld type, was caused by rubbing between the outer surface of the shaft and the surface of the bore in the shield plug. Deflection of the shaft by radial hydraulic force on the impeller had reduced the running clearance to zero just before seizure. The pump was operating at an off-design condition well removed from its balance line when the seizure occurred.

The test pump with a molten-salt-lubricated bearing was equipped with a new journal and bearing fabricated of INOR-8. During the shakedown of the test facility, it was noted that the hot, wetted end of a thermocouple well (3/8-inch-diameter tube) had corroded away. Operation will be resumed as soon as an analysis of the fuel supply and a metallurgical examination of the remainder of the thermocouple tube has been made.

A prototype model of the two-level conductivity-type liquid-level probe being developed for use in single-point measurement of liquid level in the MSRE storage tanks was constructed. The completed probe assembly is shown in Fig.13. The basic principle of operation of the probe was reported previously; however, the structural design of the probe differs from the conceptual design described previously in that the control sampling access hole and the mounting flange have been eliminated. The changes were necessitated by changes in the design of the storage tanks that precluded the use of the central access hole for level-probe installation. In the revised installation, the probe will be welded into a pipe nipple and will not be removable.

The probe assembly is being tested in molten salt under simulated operating conditions. Initial results of the tests indicate that the design concept is correct. Signals of 100-mV amplitude were received when the salt was in contact with the probe. The signal level was less than 20 mV when the salt level was below the probe. It is expected that this latter signal level can be reduced by balancing capacities and by the use of a phase-sensitive demodulating circuit in the receiving equipment.

Developmental testing of a continuous liquid-level-indicating element for use in the measurement of molten-salt levels in the MSRE fuel and coolant pump bowls was continued. A four-month initial test at temperatures between 900 and 1300°F was terminated on June 1. During the last three months of this period, the temperature was maintained at 1200°F, and the molten salt was held at a constant level. The maximum variation recorded during this period was 0. 1 in. The span of the instrument is 5 in. Tests made at the end of the four-month test period revealed no evidence of calibration shift, hysteresis, or other degradation of the performance characteristics of the instrument in excess of 2% of full. As a result of vapor deposition in the core tube of the instrument, however, solid deposits were found on a spark-plug level probe removed from the test stand at the conclusion of the four-month test. Subsequent checks revealed no evidence that the instrument was damaged by this repeated heating and cooling. The instrument was returned to operation at 1200°F, and long-term testing is continuing.

A third instrument is being constructed and will be installed on the MSRE pump testing facility to obtain experience under operational conditions approximating those which will be encountered in the MSRE. This instrument will use an INOR-8 metal-ball float, since graphite will not float in the barren salt used in this facility. The transformer will be mounted above the float because this type of assembly is preferred for the MSRE installation and because tests of a similar unit, described above, revealed no objectionable operational characteristics.

The Electra System was placed in field operation on a freeze-valve testing facility in mid-August. It is now undergoing full field tests utilizing the control system to be used for the reactor. The Electra System is composed of modular units, as previously described. The internal wiring of one module card containing two single-alarm switches: the top unit is the power supply, and the bottom unit is the module enclosure.

Tests of the Daystrom Magsense Control Relay, Model A-82, were completed. As previously reported, this unit could be utilized for the flange- and valve-monitoring systems; however, the individual units would have to be integrated into a system. This would require adding alarm-limit lights, relays, and an enclosure, as well as a common power supply. Furthermore, the input resistance of the units is so low (350 ohms) that it could cause a problem with long thermocouple leads.

Development work on the mercury-jet-commutator thermocouple-scanning system is continuing. The switch was modified to reduce spurious noise generation. An alarm discriminator was designed and constructed, and the reference-thermocouple isolation system was improved and packaged with the alarm discriminator. A differential de amplifier with variable bandwidth was received, and an existing 17-in. oscilloscope was repaired to display the thermocouple signals.

The complete system was assembled and tested in the laboratory in early May. A diagram of the system as it now exists is shown in Fig. 18. The laboratory tests with simulated thermocouple signals were successful, and the system was installed on a liquid-level test facility in early August. One hundred thermocouples from the test facility were used as input signals to the scanner. At present, the system continues to operate satisfactorily after more than 700 hours of operation. Operation will be continued to determine the operating life of the mercury switch.

The input signal is fed to an integrating system consisting of a capacitor and the resistance of the de amplifier. The signal level is held during the point-to-point switching time. The reference thermocouple signal is fed to two double-pole double-throw choppers with a capacitor between the poles of each chopper. The output of the amplifier is fed to the oscilloscope and to the alarm discriminator. If the reference signal and the commutated signal are equal, a straight line is seen on the oscilloscope.

A block diagram of the alarm discriminator is shown in Fig. 20. This circuit is designed to produce an alarm when pulse signals having an amplitude of 1 volt or greater and a repetition rate of 20 pulses per second are applied to the input. A pulse-integrating (count-rate) circuit prevents spurious alarms from random noise pulses. The discriminator-alarm circuitry is completely transistorized and is packaged in the housing. Within the housing are the reference-thermocouple isolation system, a sync-pulse amplifier for driving the oscilloscope trigger, and the necessary power-supply circuits.

Radiator Thermocouple Test. Testing of mechanical thermocouple attachments for use on radiator tubes in the MSRE was resumed after the test apparatus was modified to eliminate errors in measuring the inner wall temperature. Provisions for purging with inert gas were added; the reference thermocouple was attached to the inner wall of the INOR-8 tube by spot welding, and thermal insulation was placed between the thermocouples and the copper slug (0. 21).

Several tests were run with the thermocouples attached as described above and with thermal insulation consisting of different thicknesses of Fiberfrax board or paper placed over the junction end of the thermocouple. The thermocouple shown at the far right in. 22 is insulated with Fiberfrax paper, and the thermocouple second from the right is insulated with Fiberfrax board.

Engineering Test Loop Installation. Eight MSRE-prototype surface-mounted thermocouples were installed in the ETL facility to determine, under simulated operating conditions, the reliability of attachments and the accuracy of wall temperature measurements taken with thermocouples located on the walls of pipes and components adjacent to heaters.

All the thermocouples have been in service since April 16, 1962 and are still performing satisfactorily; however, they have accumulated only loop downtime. With salt circulating at the above temperatures, differences in readings between the test thermocouples and the respective.

Drift Test. Six Inconel-sheathed MgO-insulated Chromel-Alumel thermocouples are being tested to determine the stability of calibration that has been accumulated to date. None of the thermocouples have drifted more than ±2°C equivalent in emf output.

Bayonet Thermocouples. Ten MSRE-prototype wall-mounted thermocouples were installed in the drain-tank bayonet-cooler test facility to determine the effects of fast temperature transients on the life of these thermocouples and to determine how fast they would respond to transients. The thermocouples tested consisted of both 1/16-in. -OD, sheathed, single-conductor, two-wire, and 1/8-in. -OD, sheathed, duplex thermocouples with junctions grounded to walls and end seals. One 1/8-in. -OD unit failed immediately after startup of the test. Its early failure is thought to have been due to faulty construction, since the other nine units have been subjected to rapid temperature changes between 1200 and 600°F for over a week without failing. The thermocouples that endure the thermal-cycling test will be checked for speed of response.

Thermocouple Disconnects. A six-circuit radiation-resistant thermocouple-disconnect assembly that was fabricated from commercially available components is shown in Fig. 25. This disconnect is simpler in construction than the assembly previously described and is more compatible with MSRE requirements. The plug and jack panels were supplied by the Thermo Electric Company and are similar to their standard plug and jack panel assemblies, except for the insulating material, which is Electropestos. The housings are modified FS-type conduit boxes. The jack housing (top half) has a removable back plate to facilitate wiring connections. Swaged-type tube fittings are utilized to support and restrain the individual metal-sheathed thermocouples. A disconnect of this type was tested in the remote-maintenance test facility and operated satisfactorily. Alignment of the pins during remote maintenance operations will be accomplished by means of a guide incorporated in the handling tool.

Of both oxide and fluoride reaction products were detected; however, on specimen surfaces examined under the electron microscope and diffraction camera. In order to determine whether these films had affected passivation of the INOR-8 surfaces, two additional experiments were run with or over the fluoride salt.

The two experiments were performed in 2-in. -diam isothermal INOR-8 pots at temperatures of 1112 and 1292°F, respectively. Although both were scheduled for 1000 hr of operation, depletion of the CF supply at the higher temperature required termination of this experiment after 700 hr. Specimens being tested at 1112°F were removed from the vessel at 100-hr intervals. The specimens exposed to the salt underwent negligible weight changes and showed no consistent pattern of weight loss or gain. However, specimens tested in the vapor phase exhibited a slight weight increase, in accordance with previous test results. Specimens immersed in salt at 1292°F gained substantial weight (1 to 3 mg/cm), and in some cases, a metallic-appearing coating was noted. Analyses of the coating showed it to consist principally of nickel, with relatively large amounts (>5%) of molybdenum.

Metallographic examinations of the specimens tested at 1112°F revealed no evidence of surface changes. Specimens tested at 1292°F were lightly pitted in areas not covered by the metallic coating, as evidence of carburization could be detected metallographically; however, chemical analyses of the specimens after the test showed no changes in carbon content compared with that of as-received samples.

The joint shown in 2 was changed by flaring the weld end sufficiently so that weld rollover would not interfere with the insertion of an ultrasonic inspection probe into the tube. The welding conditions established to assure a minimum weld penetration of 42 mils are listed below.

Demonstrate suitable fabrication procedures and welding techniques and to study the effect of size on the back-brazing operation. The assembly contained 96 welded and back-brazed joints. Welding was completed without difficulty, and good flow of braze metal, indicated by filleting, occurred in all but one of the joints. Metallographic investigation of this brazed joint revealed that contamination in the vicinity of the feeder holes had interfered with the flow of the alloy, as may be seen in Fig. We5.

Four to six exposures were required to completely inspect each weld; however, the tube arrangement on the MSRE heat exchanger allows for several tube welds to be radiographed at one time, and the operation will be more economical than for the test welds. The defects observed were somewhat distorted because of the method of film placement, but, despite this, pores several mills in diameter were detected.

That serve as an ultrasonic generator and receiver, respectively. The proper ultrasonic frequency and beam incident angles were determined, and a custom probe was designed and fabricated. Approximately 20 brazed joints with various degrees of bonding were evaluated using this system, and metallographic examinations are in progress to provide correlation of the test results.

A mechanical device was designed that provides for uniform scanning of the probe in the tube, thus ensuring complete inspection coverage. This device should permit more rapid inspection and may also allow automatic recording of unbonded areas.

The brazing procedure and equipment described previously for remotely fabricating INOR-8 pipe were used in the preparation of six prototype joints. Evaluation of these by ultrasonic techniques developed previously indicated only minor non-bonding in five of the brazed areas. The sixth joint contained a number of unbonded areas in the upper portion of the braze. The bonding in a typical remotely brazed joint is described.

A mechanical properties investigation is being made of INOR-8 weld material from heats to be used in the MSRE. As part of the preliminary studies, data were obtained on the effect of stress-relieving on stress rupture properties. These initial tests were made using transverse weld.

Specimens cut from a weld-containing base plate (heat No. N1-5090) and weld wire. Two samples were tested at 1500°F in the as-welded condition, and two in the stress-relieved condition (2 hr at 1600°F). The data obtained are presented in Table 4. 1. It is evident that the stress-relieving treatment improved the overall properties of the weldment, probably because of a redistribution of micro-constituents such as.

Tests were also performed on welds made with the short-arc semiautomatic welding process. Tensile tests at 1400°F provided the data presented in Table 4. 2. The low ductilities were probably due to defects in the weld. It is expected that improvements in the process can produce welds having properties comparable with those of welds produced by the manual, tungsten-arc process.

The mechanical properties of typical INOR-8 material procured for MSRE construction are being determined in order to evaluate the effects of large-quantity production and improved-quality requirements. Specimens for tensile and stress-rupture testing were prepared from N1-5081. Tensile properties will be tested from room temperature to 1800°F, and stress-rupture properties will be determined in air at Thermal.

The thermal-fatigue properties of INOR-8 are being determined with methods described by Carden. Fifteen tests were completed at maximum test temperatures in the range of 1250 to 1600°F and cycle periods on type 504 stainless steel. The data on Inconel and stainless steel are included for comparison.

The thermal-fatigue data indicate that Inconel and type 304 stainless steel have a greater ability to sustain plastic flow than INOR-8. The plastic strain per cycle is less in INOR-8 because of its lower thermal coefficient of expansion and higher elastic strength.

Specimens of grade TS-281 graphite were evaluated for molten salt and mercury permeation in standard screening tests, and the specimens met MSRE design requirements. This graphite was produced for the Engineering Test Loop in the size required for the MSRE and with essentially the same characteristics as those of the graphite for.

Exposure of TS-281 test pieces to molten salt at the conditions described in Table 4. 4 resulted in an average salt permeation of 0. 2% of the bulk volume. The MSRE specification allows a maximum of 0. 5% permeation.

In the testing of the TS-281 specimens, the graphite bars were found to be slightly more porous and less dense toward their central axis; however, these regions were well within the requirements specified for MSRE graphite. Radiographic examinations are being made to determine the distribution of salt impregnation in CGB-Y and TS-281 graphite.

The reaction (weight gain) of INOR-8 varied in proportion to the amount of graphite present and was least in the test with no graphite. This increased attack in the presence of graphite was probably caused by oxygen products available in the graphite.

A study was begun to develop the fabrication procedure necessary to make cylindrical shapes of GdPO3 and GdO5s—Al2O3 mixtures. These parts are of interest as control rod elements for the MSRE and are being designed to withstand a nitrogen atmosphere contaminated with air and moisture at temperatures up to 1400°F. Al2O3 is added to minimize hydrolysis and subsequent deterioration of the GdO5s.

A preliminary test was made of the sintering characteristics of the materials under a single set of conditions. Pellets containing 0, 20, and 30 wt% Al2O3 were prepared by dry blending, pressing, and sintering in hydrogen at 1750°F for 5 hours. All sintered pieces were set on molybdenum sheet. Of the compositions tested, only Gd2O3 gave a sound pellet with good density. The density and shrinkage data are listed in Table 4. 5. The mixtures of Gd2O3 and Al2O3 showed evidence of eutectic melting or the formation of a low-melting-temperature compound that indicated too high a sintering temperature. Additional specimens of Gd2O3-Al2O3 mixtures with various green densities have optimum sintering conditions.

Pellets of Gd2O3 with green densities ranging from 2. 9 to 3. 8 g/cm³ were tested for determining the effects of green density on sintering characteristics. Shrinkage and bulk density data for these pellet cylinders, having the dimensions required for MSRE control rods, will be fabricated for proof testing.

The carbon tetrafluoride found in the cover gas over molten-salt fuel irradiated in graphite crucibles in assembly ORNL-MIR-7-3 is considered to have formed at the salt-graphite interfaces and to have passed through the graphite to the cover gas. It is postulated that if the CF4 had been forced to pass through molten fuel, it would have been consumed. Two experimental assemblies, ORNL-MYR-7-4 and 47-5, were designed to test this hypothesis and to study the formation of CF4.

Six cylindrical INOR-8 capsules, four containing a central graphite core submerged in fuel salt, and two containing graphite crucibles, were installed in assembly ORNL-MTR-17. The capsules were immersed in molten sodium, which served as a heat transfer medium. The primary purpose of the experiment was to determine whether CF4 would exist in the cover gas over MSRE fuel irradiated in contact with completely submerged graphite. Because the fuel could not be maintained molten during reactor scrams and shutdowns, the graphite surface was intermittently in direct contact with the cover gas through cracks in the solid fuel. The crucible capsules, which contained exposed graphite in contact with fuel, provided a basis for comparison with the capsules of the 73 experiment and an evaluation of the effectiveness of graphite submersion in preventing the net generation of CF4. Also, experiment 47 provided for a further demonstration of the compatibility of the fuel-graphite-INOR-8 system under thermal conditions at least as severe as those expected to exist during MSRE.

The temperature history of the capsule during the irradiation. The internal temperature distribution (Fig. 5. 1), obtained by use of the computer program TOSS, indicates that the thermocouple should give, essentially, the graphite-to-salt interface temperature. The maximum measured temperature among the four instrumented capsules was 1400 ± 50°F. The area of the end cap wetted by the salt was about 12% of the total 5. 6 in. of metal surface in contact with the salt.

The assembly was removed from the MIR, partially disassembled, and returned to ORNL, where it was completely dismantled. Post-irradiation examination of the capsules is in progress. As an aid to interpretation of irradiation effects, an out-of-pile experiment was run that duplicated the temperature history, including the transients.

The 47-5 experimental assembly was designed and constructed to permit gas sampling from two capsules during irradiation to study the CF2 content, if any, of the offgas from fissioning MSRE fuel in contact with submerged long; and they contain a central CGB graphite core 1/2 in. in diameter. The capsules differ only in the uranium concentration in the fuel.

Additional capsules included in the assembly are designed to provide a range of oxidation-reduction levels that include what might be both early and late stages in the life history of a reactor. This is accomplished by altering the accessibility of chromium from the container alloy (INOR-8) to the fuel. These capsules are externally similar to the purged capsules, but the graphite cores are markedly different. A high metal-to-graphite wetted-surface-area ratio (46:1) is obtained by using a low metal-to-graphite surface area ratio (1:4) is obtained by using a close-fitting graphite crucible 0. 7 in. in internal diameter.

An extreme case in the oxidation study is a capsule with no metal; that is, with graphite pre-permeated with fuel so that the only fuel in the capsule is contained within the pores of an isolated graphite core. Two small capsules of this type (Fig. 5. 5) are included and will be operated AGOT graphite cores. Irradiation is scheduled to begin the week of.

Examinations of irradiated specimens from assembly ORNL-MTR-1-7-3, the assembly in which CF2 was first detected, provided some additional information on the corrosion products and on the distribution of radioactivity and salt in the graphite. The possibility that much of the CF2 could have been formed from the fluorine released from the frozen salt after shutdown, as found in test We7ad, shed new light on the interpretation of the results of test 47-3. The fuel mixture irradiated in this experiment was initially.

Corrosion product analyses were carried out on an aliquot of the solution produced during dissolution of the irradiated fuel to obtain gas samples for reducing power analyses. The aliquot was evaporated to dryness three times after additions of methanol to remove the excess boric acid used to improve the initial dissolution. The dry residue was dissolved in 10 to 15 ml of 9 M HNO3 with 2 ml of 3 M hydroxylamine to reduce any hexavalent chromium to the trivalent state, and the thorium was removed from the solution on an anion-exchange column. The solution was then diluted to 5 N HNO3, and the uranium was removed by extraction into 20% TBP in hexane or Amsco. The iron, chromium, nickel, and molybdenum corrosion products were determined by the intensity of their spectral lines compared with an added internal standard. The readings were made with a densitometer on the photographic plate.

The analyses for corrosion products, as shown in Table 5. 2, gave values somewhat different from those previously reported. The corrosion product concentrations that indicate attack on INOR-8 coupons have been revised to the order of 100 ppm, rather than several hundred or thousand ppm, and therefore the data of Table 5. 1 for iron, chromium, and nickel indicate mildly reducing conditions. They present some puzzling aspects, however, in that differences are not discernible between capsules that produced widely different amounts of CF. This can be explained if the larger amounts of CF arose from attack of the graphite by fluorine released after freezing of the fuel.

Another point of interest is the absence of molybdenum (below the 50 ppm limit of detection) in the fuel, in spite of obvious attack on some of the molybdenum coupons. The molybdenum may have volatilized as MoO, but its presence in a reducing melt would be difficult to reconcile. It would be expected, however, in an atmosphere that would produce XeF or CF4. Not finding the molybdenum in the fuel may indicate that it deposited on the wall of the capsule.

The compound Xe, which was recently discovered at the Argonne National Laboratory, is being studied. As mentioned later in connection with experiment Lal, there is a close correlation between fluorine or evidence of fluorination in the form of XeF, and a pronounced deficiency of xenon in the irradiated cover gas. This correlation and an observed increase in the xenon-to-krypton ratio in samples collected over a long period of time are circumstantial evidence that XeF4 was formed in some capsules. Conversely, the presence of xenon in other capsules is a possible index of the absence of fluorine, at least during the time favorable for reaction with xenon, and this must overlap part of the range in which XeF4 is formed. The reaction between xenon and fluorine proceeds at 100°C.

Data on the distribution of radioactivity and salt were obtained from cored samples of graphite parts. Patterns of radioactivity were determined by gamma spectrometry, and the salt distribution was obtained from petrographic studies with an optical microscope. The scatter of the data precludes immediate interpretation, and the data will therefore be held for examination along with data from future similar experiments.

Fuel and submerged graphite were tested further with the irradiation of four capsules, described previously, at a flux of 10^13 neutrons/cm^2-sec for more than 1500 hr in the MTR. The data sought in the test, namely the partial pressure of CF4, at operating conditions, were obscured in two of the capsules opened thus far by large amounts of radiolytic fluorine from the frozen fuel. Of the fluorine content in the gas phase, which was 1%.

Two smaller capsules containing molten salt in graphite crucibles were irradiated in the same assembly (ORNL-MTR-17) and received similar neutron dosages and heating cycles. These capsules were also described previously. These two capsules were included in the assembly to provide conditions favorable for the accumulation of a measurable steady-state concentration of CF4 at two power densities; one capsule contained twice as much UF4 as the other capsule. The one capsule opened thus far operated at a slightly lower power density than the other because of its location. No fluorine and only a modest amount of CF4 for this type of configuration were found.

Fluorine atoms undoubtedly are formed in fissioning fuel at an appreciable rate as a result of radiolysis. The rate of formation is probably proportional to the power density. The lack of corrosion of metal or graphite indicates that rapid reverse reactions in the molten fuel consume the fluorine atoms and lower the steady-state concentration of elemental fluorine to negligible levels. All other chemical components in the operating fuel system, including moderator and container, remain at virtual thermodynamic equilibrium as long as the fissioning fuel is molten.

As shown by some of the results described below, restricted mobility in the frozen crystals of fuel, along with the pronounced drop in temperatures that prevail in irradiation test capsules after reactor shutdown, may, on occasion, lead to off-equilibrium conditions in the form of excessive amounts of unreacted elemental fluorine. In such cases, the reverse reaction mechanisms that consume fluorine are even more drastically curtailed on shutdown than is the rate of energy release that gives rise to fluorine atoms. The resulting buildup of fluorine molecules in the frozen capsule contrasts markedly with the situation at operating conditions.

Also, the marked contrast between various frozen samples implies that small differences in geometry or freezing history may be of controlling importance. Not all freezing liberates fluorine. Furthermore, there does not seem to have been a significant amount of fluorine formed in the 30 freezings that occurred during the in-pile exposure, probably because of an insufficient time lapse in some cases. Additionally, there were capsules in which no fluorine was found even after the final lengthy cooling period. The question of why some capsules did and some did not contain fluorine can be answered only conjecturally on the basis of current information.

The capsules were constructed of 1/16-inch-wall INOR-8 tubing. The larger type contained 25 g of fuel of the nominal composition and were filled by liquid transfer to a level controlled by blowing excess fuel pack through the dip leg associated with the vent line. Somewhat less than the design volume of 3. 5 cm3 of vapor space at temperature probably remained in the capsule, perhaps because of capillary effects. Because of contraction of the fuel, principally on freezing, there was 2. 5 cm more vapor space at room temperature than at the operating temperature. The room-temperature volumes, as calibrated with known volumes after puncture and gas collection, were about 4. 5 cm. Initially two concentrations of UF were to be used in pairs of the large capsules, but breakage of a transfer line during filling, attributed to embrittlement by sulfur from an unknown source, eliminated the possibility of meeting schedules with the more concentrated fuel.

The smaller capsules were loaded with molded ingots of about 10 g of fuel contained in graphite crucibles or liners, and in one of them, the UF6 concentration was increased to 1. 4 mole% to provide a power density of about 160 u/em. The cover-gas space had a volume of about 2 cm3. There were no thermocouples in these capsules, and the fuel should not have been in contact with any metal, although traces of solvent probably distilled to the interface between the graphite liner and the INOR-8 capsule wall.

The metal capsule parts were cleaned by firing in hydrogen gas at 1000°C, but a vacuum of questionable quality was inadvertently imposed while the parts were still at temperature. The resulting contamination by air caused a greenish oxide film on the INOR-8 parts, but time for another treatment had elapsed before the error was noted. The film was partially removed with steel wool prior to assembling and welding the parts in a helium-filled glove box.

The larger capsules were then connected with a filling system and heated. The molten fuel salt was run into each capsule, and the excess blown back with helium pressure. The fuel salt level was monitored with a television X-ray system. Final closure was made in a glove box, where the external ends of the fill tubes were crimped and welded shut.

The results of ionic analyses of the bulk constituents and analyses of the corrosion products of the two fuels prepared for use in Experiment 8 hours with a 5:1 hydrogen-hydrogen fluoride gas mixture, followed by a 48-hour sparge with hydrogen gas.

A semi-quantitative spectrographic analysis of the graphite, as shown in Table 5. 4, revealed only the usual low levels of trace elements, some of which may have been introduced to the specimens during the various machining and handling operations. The elements analyzed for but not detected are listed below.

The fuel salt froze within 5 minutes after the reactor shutdown that terminated the irradiation of assembly 47-4. Calculations of the decay energy in the large capsules indicated that during the first 1-hour period following the initial 5-minute freezing period, about 10 watt-hours of energy was dissipated, whereas during normal irradiation about 810 watts were dissipated.

Differences in flux for the various capsules were due to the flux gradient in the beam hole at the MTR. The values for the thermal flux were obtained from the activation of Co in the stainless steel wires that were used as dosimeters and were confirmed by counting crol. They apply to 1553 hr during the period from March 12 to June 4, 1962. The flux was determined on both the exposed and the shaded side of the capsule, but only averaged values are tabulated. These values are higher than the design figures, and the gradient is twice the design value. If these data are correct, the burnup in the capsules varied over a threefold range. No explanation has been found for the discrepancy between these values and the design estimates, which are more consistent with heat transfer calculations.

The temperatures were controlled from capsule 24, and the changes in the retractor position required to hold a constant temperature were not unusual. The thermocouple reading for capsule 45 appeared to drift downward by about 35°C during the 12-week exposure, but this was the only symptom of deviant temperature recordings.

The capsules were punctured at ORNL in Building 4501 hot cells on a flat surface previously machined for the purpose. The screw-driven puncturing tool was sealed by a bellows and, at the flat surface, by a Neoprene O-ring. Gas escaped into a calibrated collection system that had been evacuated and leak-checked. A Toeppler pump was used to transfer gases collected at low pressures. The analyses were made by mass spectrometry; those on samples containing fluorine were made at K-25.

Data from Capsules 5 and 6. The volume of helium (from the glove box atmosphere) and argon (from the welding torch blanket) was only one-half the free volume of irradiated capsule 6, as shown in Table 5. 7. This could have resulted from an effective temperature of 300°C during welding. The amounts of xenon and krypton are in agreement with the calculated yield. This may mean that XeF4 was absent from the capsule, or that no F2 was present, or, with even less assurance, that the CF4 pressure in this capsule was representative of that to be expected in the graphite at operating conditions. If so, the CF4 pressure was around 120 mm Hg at 715°C.

The data of Table 5. 8 for control capsule 5 indicate that there was very little inleakage of air during sampling of capsule 5. The volumes of helium and argon are in reasonable agreement with the values obtained for capsule 6. The high temperature of the capsule during welding seems to be a reasonable explanation for the small volume of those gases.

Data from Capsule 24: When irradiated, capsule 24 was punctured, and 84 cm (STP) of gas was collected. This was the amount remaining after some reaction with the apparatus. A correction has been made for the amount that reacted with the mercury in the Toeppler pump and developed a black scum that was identified by x-ray as HgPb. The gas was later identified as predominantly Pb. Since the collection system was not designed for a reactive gas, an appreciable amount of Pb must have been lost to the metallic parts of the system. The remainder reacted with gas to give SiF4 and O2, and with other oxides to give O7. Studies of the gas were hampered by the presence of an excessive amount of Te29 activity. The free volume of capsule 24 at room temperature was 4. 6 cm3, based on the pressure change when helium was expanded into the capsule from a known.

Portions of gas were collected under a variety of conditions. The krypton yield listed above is in fair agreement with the calculated value, but the xenon yield is far too low. Later samples, obtained after long exposure of the capsule to an evacuated 3-liter container, had 0. 3 cm3 of xenon and less than one-tenth that amount of krypton.

The CF content, approximately 15 em, would have corresponded to a partial pressure of nearly 20 atmospheres had it been present at operating temperature. This is higher by a factor of 100 than found in capsules that yielded no evidence of free fluorine.

Capsule 24 was sawed open to reveal a longitudinal cross-section. No damage or evidence of corrosion was visible under low magnification. Petrographic samples from random locations were, in general, too fine-grained (crystallites less than 1 μ in size) to be identified. One sample from near the graphite, near the center of the capsule, was clearly recognized to contain the normal phases and to have green U in the 7LiF-6(UF4, TaF4) solid solution. This means that the fluoride deficiency in the salt was shared randomly, as expected, for the loss of fluorine from the frozen state but not for loss from the liquid state.

Gamma spectrometry of the samples chosen for petrographic examination revealed a preponderance of ruthenium toward the lower part of the fuel when compared with the zirconium-niobium activity that is generally assumed to be uniformly dispersed with the ZrF in the fuel. Cerium activity was fairly evenly distributed with the zirconium-niobium throughout the fuel, and cesium, along with zirconium-niobium, was found on metal surfaces exposed to the gas phase.

Data from Capsule 36: The analyses of the gas from irradiated capsule 36, a duplicate of capsule 24, are more directly representative of the contents of the capsule because an essentially all-metal collection system, comprised largely of prefluorinated nickel, was used to transfer and hold the samples, and because a surplus of sample was available for mass spectrometry. Also, the analysis was made promptly. This is pertinent because samples allowed to sit in incompletely conditioned apparatus showed evidence of reaction of fluorine. The analytical data are presented.

The quantity of fluorine was too great to have been present at operating temperatures. The amount of CF4 agrees well with that found in duplicate capsule 24. Also, the xenon appears to have been held up, as if by XeI4, while the krypton is present in roughly the expected yield.

An attempt was made to remove the contents of capsule 36 by melting and to provide representative ground samples, all under an inert atmosphere, in a manner suitable for chemical analysis and, in particular, for a determination of the reducing power that is expected as a consequence of the loss of fluorine. An apparatus for accomplishing such a sequence of operation in a hot cell worked well with capsule 3A, an unirradiated control sample, and at first appeared to have given satisfactory results with capsule 36. The melting-out operation yielded, however, only about half the capsule contents, and the melted-out salt was green. This might be explained by segregation of the reduced products in the high-melting heel.

Data from Control Capsule 3A. Capsule 3A, which was an unirradiated control for capsules 24 and 36, was subjected to thermal cycles. The absence of argon and the presence of 1 atm of helium may be explained by the fact that the final closure involved welding crimped capillary tubes.

Experimental evidence from previous in-pile tests lends confidence to the view that high-pressure fluorine is not generated by molten fissioning fuel. There is no evidence of severe corrosion on metal exposed to the gas phase above fissioning fuel or on metal wet by fuel. Likewise, no severe damage was observed in similarly exposed graphite.

More fluorine was found than should have been produced by the decay energy liberated during the 5 min required for cooling to essentially room temperature. When the reactor was shut down, the power produced was 100 hr, and 0. 19 W in 95 days (calculated from the Way-Wigner equation). Assuming that half of the energy released during a 95-day cooling period was absorbed in the fuel, a G value of only 0. 035 would have been required to produce the fluorine found in capsule 36.

No final choice of a theory explaining why fluorine is not always observed can be made. A difference in crystallization behavior is a possibility. The results from capsules 24 and 36 are probably quite anomalous in comparison with anything that has been seen before in earlier experiments. They point to a problem that requires attention but which does not appear to be a serious threat to the integrity of the MSRE.

The proposed simplification of the MSRE fuel mixture by the omission of Thi led to a more detailed study of the ternary system LiF-BeF2-ZrF4, with a view toward prescribing suitable solvents to contain the 0. 15 mole % UF6 now needed for criticality. The phase diagram of the solvent system did not change significantly, but new information on liquidus contours within the system established the peritectic point involving the temperatures along the boundary curve separating the primary phase fields of 6LiF-BeF2-ZrF4 and LiF was obtained.

A minor surprise, in view of the rather unrestricted interchangeability of the quadrivalent cations ZrF4, ThF4, and UF4, in the 10 to 15 mole % MF4 concentration range, was found in the fact that 7 mole %, for a change in composition of only 2 mole %, is unusual in fluoride fuel mixtures and hence provides an interesting point for further analysis from the standpoint of the thermodynamics of solutions.

One of the specifications for the fuel was a melting point below 450°C so that the fuel would not freeze before the coolant. Since the 0. 15 mole% UF6 in the fuel was expected to cause only a slight lowering of the liquidus, the fuel solvent was selected from the 450°C contour. The 450°C contour on a larger scale than that used previously. The maximum LiF content occurs, in terms of the nearest whole numbers, near 67 mole% LiF, 29 mole% BeS, and 4 mole% ZrF4. Since both the vapor pressure and the viscosity should decrease as the LiF concentration increases, this composition region is of interest as a fuel solvent.

Estimated melting point of 445°C was therefore selected for a particular study. The obtuse corner in the 450°C contour marks the change from LiF as a primary phase to 6LiF-BeF2-ZrF4, and for the fuel composition designated above, the primary phase is expected to be 6LiF-BeF2-ZrF4. Whether significant differences can be detected between liquids such as conjectural, but a richer ZrF4 content may prove advantageous.

Samples of compositions in the LiF-BeF2-ZrF4 system that contain more than 60% BeF2, and hence are too viscous to be of present interest as fuels, were quenched from temperatures above the liquidus. The quenched samples consisted of two amorphous materials of distinctly different indices of refraction, as if two glass phases of different composition were simultaneously present. If this implication is borne out, the first instance of liquid-liquid immiscibility in fluoride melts will have been encountered.

Studies pertaining to concentrated solutions for fuel makeup and to segregation in the quinary system that includes ThF in MSRE fuels were nearing completion at approximately the same time that it was proposed that the inconvenience of carrying token amounts of Th could be avoided. The conclusions from these investigations are applicable, in a representative fashion at least, to fuels from the quaternary system that do not contain ThF and are therefore presented in the next two sections as examples of the type of behavior that can be expected.

One of the means considered for fueling the MSRE included a mole percent by titrating to criticality with the liquid LiF-UF4 eutectic mixture (73-27 mole percent, 527°C). A study of the phase behavior and characteristics of the composition section that gives all possible combinations of solvent and concentrate shows (2 and Table 6. 1) that the melting temperature of the LiF-UF4.

The mixture is higher than that of any intermediate composition formed during fueling; at least four crystalline compounds appear as primary phases at various intermediate compositions. Uranium and thorium crystallize together in a single solid-solution phase. From the phase relationships observed in this composition section, it appears that the LiF-UF eutectic mixture should serve as a suitable fueling mixture for the MSRE. At decreasing concentrations of UF, uranium-containing phases precipitate later in the crystallizing sequence. In the fuel itself, the uranium compound precipitates as the tertiary phase, and solids that do not contain UF are formed during the crystallization of the primary and secondary phases.

An assumed sequence of equilibrium fractionations in the freezing regarding (1) the fraction of ZrF4 remaining in the liquid state at the onset of crystallization of phases containing UF, and whether this ZrF4 concentration was adequate for protection against precipitation of UOs; (2) the concentration of uranium in the crystalline equilibrium phases within which it is contained during freezing and the relative position of these phases in the sequence of crystallization reactions; and (4) the approximate concentration of BeFs in the liquid remaining at temperatures just above the solidus.

Although only an exploratory study of the freezing reactions was made, some qualitative statements regarding the crystallization are warranted. During freezing, the ZrF2 concentration in the liquid fraction of the mixture is reduced as the primary and secondary phases within the liquid are increased, and the zirconium-to-uranium concentration ratio is decreased.

The apparent solidus temperature for the five-component mixture is 429°C. The relatively short temperature interval required for complete freezing is not conducive to extensive segregation or to a large difference in the average composition of the initial and final residual liquids. Hence, the products of crystallization do not contain so much free BeF2 that the cooled fuel mixture should be expected to be very hygroscopic. The last solid phase observed on freezing the fuel mixture is 7LiF·6(U,Th)F4, which contains 14. 4 mole % UF6. The proportion of UF6 was determined by two independent methods: (1) by calculation of the material balance and (2) from measurements of the refractive indices of the solid solution. Three nonhygroscopic solid phases were found in melts cooled under. It is to be noted that specimens obtained from a variety of experiments and experimental engineering tests, in which equilibrium cooling did not occur, rather than the equilibrium solids.

Structures of LiRbFs and LiCsfs were found to be isomorphous. In each crystal, the Li ions are surrounded by tetrahedra of fluoride ions, and these tetrahedra share corners and edges in such a manner as to form continuous sheets. The Rb and Cs ions are situated between the sheets and bind them together.

Stabilization of Fluorite NaYF4 Solid Solution. The equilibrium inversion temperature for the pure NaYF4 crystals, inverting from the high-temperature fluorite form to the low-temperature hexagonal form, is 691°C. During continuing investigations of the phase relationships in the system NaF-YF3, it was discovered that at nearly saturating concentrations of YF3 in the fluorite cubic solid solution, NaYF4-YF3 solid solutions consisting of approximately 65 mole% YF3 appear as equilibrium phases to temperatures below 475°C.

A marked decrease in the corrosion of grade-A nickel containers used for the HF dehydration of molten LiF was achieved by using a hydrogen atmosphere at all times when heat is applied. Previously, LiF intended for the production of ultrapure crystals was melted under a helium atmosphere and dehydrated with a mixture of H2 and HF. Under these conditions, both discolored and clear LiF was produced. The discolored areas contained the impurities found in grade-A nickel, such as copper, iron, manganese, and silicon, as well as nickel, in the 100 ppm range. No copper, iron, silicon, or nickel was detected by emission spectroscopy. Only 10 ppm Mn was found, and the total impurity was <400 ppm.

Suspended in the melt. The volume of the plummet, corrected to the high temperatures, was known within +0. 1%, and the change in weight of about 2. 5 g could be measured to about 1 mg. The fuel was prepared in a 200-g batch and purified by treatment with 40 g of NH4HF, to remove oxide and hydrolysis products. Temperatures were measured with a calibrated platinum vs. rhodium thermocouple in a well that projected downward into the melt from the side at an angle. The thermocouple was calibrated at the National Bureau of Standards.

At 663°C, the fuel temperature at the outlet of the core, the density is 2. 147 g/cm³. Unexplained behavior, which indicated that the plummet and stirrer had frozen in place, was noted at 50°C, approximately 100°C above the melting point. Points obtained at higher temperatures, both before and after the sticking effect was noted, fell on the same straight line. Subsequent petrographic examination of the fuel disclosed no deposits of oxide, so the data were tentatively accepted as valid. Further checks to establish this point are in progress.

Where N is the mole fraction of component i and V is the empirical molar volume of component i given in Table 6. 2. The average molecular weight of the mixture is then divided by Vinix at 600 and 800°C to obtain the density.

Since the unclad graphite moderator of the MSRE is a possible source of oxide contamination that could conceivably cause ZrOs to form in the fuel salt mixture, treatments that favor the removal of adsorbed gases from the moderator are included in the initial startup sequence. Some desorption is expected when the reactor core is heated to about 650°C in an atmosphere of flowing helium, and more can occur when a barren fluoride salt mixture is circulated for prenuclear testing. Accordingly, an investigation of the characteristics of gas evolution from graphite under conditions simulating these startup operations.

The experimental program was divided into two parts. In one set of experiments, gas evolution from graphite blocks placed in a circulating stream of helium at 650°C is being studied. The second part of this program is concerned with the removal of adsorbed gases from graphite immersed in a molten fluoride mixture.

Gas Evolution During Helium Purging. Initially, the reactor core of the MSRE will be heated to about 650°C at a maximum rate of approximately 30°C/hr while preheated helium is circulated through the core at about 75 liters/sec. Accordingly, pieces of graphite (6 to 12 in. in length) were canned in a manner that provided the same cross-sectional configuration for flow as an MSRE moderator element, and gas entry and exit ports were provided at either end. This assembly was mounted vertically in a tube furnace as part of the circuit of a gas-circulating loop. The loop was constructed so that portions of the gas stream emerging from the graphite block could be diverted system. The circulated gas stream was passed through a magnesium perchlorate drying column and a cold trap to remove moisture. Based on a uniform gas velocity through the MSRE reactor core, a flow rate of about 2. 5 liters/min through the experimental loop was assumed to approximate gas purge conditions around each moderator element. A simple programming device was used to control temperatures.

The data on the evolution of moisture from a block of AGOT graphite and from an as-received piece of ETL graphite are presented in Figs. 6. 4 and 6. 4. The predominant characteristics of the gas evolution were the removal of physically absorbed moisture at temperatures below 100°C and the removal of chemisorbed moisture over the temperature interval 200 to 400°C. The additional amount removed between 400 and 600°C should be relatively inconsequential to reactor operations. In several experiments, AGOT graphite specimens were pretreated with water vapor by circulating moist helium through the loop. The data from subsequent degassing, presented in Fig. 6. 5, provide further illustration of the characteristic bimodal behavior.

Since no purification train, except for moisture removal, was included in the helium circuit, these data demonstrate the accumulation and recombination of impurities in the system and thus are not directly applicable to the MSRE startup conditions.

Experiments are in progress to study various gas flow rates and thermal conditions. Also, the removal of air and carbonaceous gases will be followed under conditions that better simulate MSRE operations, and the results will be compared with data obtained by other experimental techniques.

Gas Evolution by Immersion in a Molten Salt: When the primary circuit of the MSRE is filled with the barren fluoride mixture for pre-nuclear test operations, additional adsorbed gas may be released from the unclad graphite moderator. Also, the salt mixture is expected to remove the oxide film from INOR-8 and to permit this source of fuel contamination to be flushed from the system. A laboratory demonstration of these processes was attempted in the following manner.

Closed vessel of IN718 alloy that contained graphite, as described below. A connecting gas manifold permitted a known volume of helium to be circulated over the melt and sampled for spectrographic analysis. Provisions were made to sample the melt periodically without serious alteration of the gas-phase constituents.

Simulation of reactor conditions was based on the duplication of the ratio of salt volume to graphite volume and the ratio of graphite surface areas. Right circular cylinders of AGOT graphite, 2, 1, and 1/2 in. in diameter, were held in a positioning rack that was submerged in the molten-salt mixture. Agitation was achieved by slowly revolving the graphite holder.

The experimental data obtained thus far in this program are shown graphically in Fig. 7. A possible conclusion from these results is that the evolution of gas from the graphite should be of little consequence to MSRE operations. Only a few tenths of a cubic centimeter of carbon monoxide escapes into the gas space per 100 cm of graphite per 100 hr, and there is little effect on the oxide content of the salt. The initial rapid rise in oxide content resembles, qualitatively, the expected dissolution of oxide scale from the INOR-8, but in general, the values for oxide content are puzzling.

Of about 1078 moles of CF4 per cm of melt per atmosphere. The experimental equipment, described previously, was recalibrated with argon, and the data were found to be in agreement with earlier measurements with that gas. Analyses by mass spectrometry of a mixture of CF4 and helium that was recirculated continuously at 700 or 800°C through had been added indicated a slow loss of CF4 at 700°C that reached a rate of, perhaps, 4% per day at 800°C. Enough uranium had been added to convert 20% of the uranium in the melt to UF3, but, for reasons not fully understood, analyses for determining the reducing power of the melt gave consistently negative results; that is, less than 0. 1 wt% U. The experiment was interrupted by trouble with a gas line before the rate of reaction at 800°C could be established with certainty.

In static experiments at 700°C involving 15 g of LiF-BeF2 (66-34 mole %) containing 1. 45 wt% U3S6 (added as UF3 crystals), no evidence of reaction of C4 with the melt was found when a one-third excess of CF4 was used in the cover gas during three trials in a 155-cm3 reaction vessel. The possibility that CF4 might react metathetically with oxides at 600°C was also investigated, but the results were inconclusive.

Work continued on the determination of oxygen in salt mixtures by the inert-gas carbon-reduction method. A graphite crucible tapped to accept a threaded plug that, in turn, screws onto a graphite spindle, is used to contain the salt. The plugged capsule facilitates the loading of the sample within the dry box and subsequent rapid weighing.

The quartz tube that is used to provide an envelope for the inert gas was modified by enlarging the diameter of the central expanded section and by inserting an inner quartz shell. These modifications were intended to lengthen the useful life of the quartz tube.

Standard calibration curves were obtained by using metallic tin standard samples of a known oxygen content that were supplied by the Laboratory Equipment Corporation. The oxygen content of reagent-grade LiF was assayed as a test determination. The value obtained was 250 ± 4. 0 ppm based on five determinations.

Although the comparison is not as good as anticipated, the results are in general agreement. Rather wide spreads are observed; however, in the results of a single method. This was noted previously and is possibly the result of (1) inherent errors in the methods used when applied to fluoride salts, (2) inhomogeneity of the sample, or (3) contamination during sampling and handling in the dry, inert-gas box. The latter has been proved to be a definite cause of error in that the results vary by a factor of 5 in some cases when the sample is deliberately exposed to the atmosphere. It is not possible at this time to eliminate either of the other aforementioned possibilities of error, but efforts are continuing to ascertain the sources of error.

Several methods were tested for the determination of oxygen in graphite. The methods used to date include (1) fluorination with KBrF2; (2) inert-gas fusion; (3) vacuum fusion; and (4) neutron activation with 14-MeV neutrons. The graphite examined was high-purity material, and the samples varied in weight from 50 to 250 mg. In the initial tests, the quantity of oxygen obtained by means of the first three procedures was essentially equivalent to the representative blanks for the procedures. Based on the weight of the sample used, the oxygen concentration in the graphite was less than 50 ppm. Considerably larger samples and attendant modifications of the apparatus would be required to establish lower limits of sensitivity.

Currently, efforts are are being directed toward the use of the neutron activation technique using 14-MeV neutrons generated by the Cockroft-Walton generator. This method is non-destructive and capable of high sensitivity that depends only on the condition of the tritium target. Oxygen (O-18) in the graphite undergoes an n,p reaction upon irradiation with high-energy neutrons to produce F-18, which has a 1. 3-s half-life. The gamma activity of the Nt is counted using a gamma spectrometer and a multichannel analyzer. Special pneumatic transfer of the sample to the counter is necessary to achieve the ultimate sensitivity. Only cursory results have been obtained thus far. It is planned to extend this technique to oxygen determinations in other materials.

Equipment includes a copper pulverizer-mixer and a copper sampling ladle that contains the solidified fuel. The sampling ladle is placed in the pulverizer-mixer, which is agitated on a mixer mill. The fuel is fractured out of the ladle, pulverized into a homogeneous powder, and transferred to a storage bottle. The homogenized fuel sample is then available for analysis.

Work on the detailed design of the fuel-processing system, which consists of a fluorination system for uranium recovery, was started. Equipment in addition to that described previously is now included for treatment of the salt with a mixture of hydrogen and hydrogen fluoride for oxide removal. A simplified flowsheet of the system is presented.

The process evolves. The 750°F NaF trap removes the bulk of the niobium. The HF-H50 mixture is condensed, sampled, and analyzed to track the progress of the treatment. The sample pot is emptied after sparging to the caustic tank where iodine and tellurium are collected. After sufficient decay, the caustic is sent to the liquid waste tank and the ORNL waste system.

Fluorination of the fuel salt volatilizes some fission products, in addition to UFe, but an overall decontamination factor of >107 is expected. Additional decontamination from ruthenium, zirconium, and niobium is obtained as the UF passes through the 750°F NaF trap. The uranium is collected as UFe3Nal in the 180°F NaF absorbers. These are portable units that will be moved to the Volatility Pilot Plant for desorption and cold trapping. Excess fluorine will be disposed of by reacting it with SO2 at 0°F.

The mixture Li2CO3-Na2CO3-K2CO3 (30-38-32 wt%) has been proposed for use in out-of-pile development studies relating to the MSRE based on similarity in properties to those of the MSRE fuel salt. The use of this mixture will ease the handling problems because it is essentially noncorrosive to stainless steel without a protective atmosphere. Measurements of the enthalpy and viscosity of this salt are reported here.
