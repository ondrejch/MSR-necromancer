The LMFR lends itself readily to a wide variety of designs and arrangements. Concepts proposed to date may be classified according to type as being internally or externally cooled, and either compact or open arrangement of cycle. Such classification has been brought about in an attempt to present designs which minimize bismuth and uranium inventories.

If we assume the cost of U238 to be $20 per gram and that of bismuth to be $2. 25 per pound, a U-Bi solution of 700 ppm uranium by weight would cost approximately $6000 per foot. This high volume cost makes it very important to design the LMFR with the minimum possible holdup.

Fuel is circulated through the core to an external heat exchanger where the heat is removed by the secondary fluid. This type provides the simplest core design, requiring simply an assembly of graphite pierced with holes for circulation of liquid-metal fuel. The major problems of heat transfer are essentially removed from the core design.

The internally cooled design offers a means of substantially reducing the U-Bi inventory of the system but considerably complicates the design of the core. The core must be designed to accommodate two fluids and sufficient surface for transferring heat from one to the other. The introduction of a secondary fluid in the core requires a greater uranium concentration than in the externally cooled system which has only U-Bi and graphite in the core. The required concentration cannot be achieved with U-Bi.

Compact arrangements. The compact arrangement may best be described as an integral or "pot type" design and may be internally or externally cooled. In such a design, the fluid fuel remains in the core except for small amounts which are withdrawn for reprocessing.

Arrangement for a closed-cycle gas turbine power plant. In this arrangement, the fuel is circulated through the core and heat exchanger, which are contained inside the same vessel. The compact arrangement offers a means of reducing the U-Bi inventory over a particular reactor designed with an open-cycle arrangement. It does, however, increase the problems associated with the design of the core, blanket, and reactor vessel. The compacting of all the equipment into a single vessel reduces the flexibility of mechanical design which the open arrangement allows, as well as intensifying the problems of thermal expansion. The reactor vessel not only becomes larger, but the number of openings is also increased, both of which complicate the vessel design.

23-1. 4 Open arrangements. The open arrangement is the type receiving the most consideration at present because of the flexibility and simplicity of design it affords the system components. Figure 23-2 shows one concept of an externally cooled LMFR using the open-cycle arrangement. In this design, both blanket and core fluids are circulated to heat exchangers located outside the reactor vessel. This type of arrangement also allows greater freedom of design for maintenance of equipment. Means must be provided for removal and/or maintenance of system components under radioactive conditions. The major disadvantage of this arrangement is the high U-Bi inventory.

23-1. 5 Containment and safety requirements. The high negative temperature coefficient and low amount of excess reactivity available make the LMFR inherently stable and safe. However, any rupture of the primary system, whether by reactor excursion or otherwise, would release fission products and polonium to the surrounding atmosphere. The primary system must therefore be surrounded by a secondary vessel for containment of radioactivity in case of such a failure. Since all materials in the reactor core have very low vapor pressures, the containment vessel need not be designed to withstand any appreciable pressure. The containment problem in the LMFR is one of containing the high-temperature liquid metal together with fission products, and such containment can be accomplished by lining the reactor and primary circuit cells with a gastight steel membrane.

The arrangement of the containment vessel also depends on the heat removal design. If an intermediate heat transfer fluid such as sodium or NaI is used, the containment may be handled as above. If a direct U-Bi to steam cycle is used, a double-wall heat exchanger must be used to maintain double containment, unless the entire building is constructed to act as the second containment barrier.

23-1. 7 Maintenance and repair provisions. It is anticipated that a substantial level of activity will be induced in the system by the circulating fuel. This means that the system should be designed so that it can be maintained despite the high radiation level. Several approaches, not mutually exclusive, to this problem are being considered: 1. Use of remote handling techniques for maintenance and repair operations; 2. Development of specialized tools and equipment for use in high-radiation environments; 3. Design of components to facilitate replacement or repair without the need for entry into highly radioactive areas; 4.

All connections between components will be made in one area, fully piped leading to the component in question. The component is removed with the overhead crane, and a new one set in place. The shielding is replaced, and the connections are remade. The connections are accessible, and pipes do not overlay each other to prevent the removal of any disconnected component. Unfortunately, placing all connections in one channel increases the fuel inventory since the piping for this arrangement is somewhat longer than that required for a more conventional arrangement.

In the open-cycle externally cooled, two-fluid LMFR, the bismuth-uranium solution serves as both the primary coolant and the fuel. In the reactor itself, there is no actual heat transfer. Instead, the solution acts as a transporter of heat to an external heat exchanger. When evaluating bismuth as a primary coolant, it is helpful to compare it with three other coolants: sodium, a typical alkali metal coolant; LiCl-KCl eutectic, a typical alkali halide salt mixture; and water. The salt eutectic used here would not be a suitable primary coolant for a thermal reactor. Its heat transfer properties, however, are typical of salt coolants.

Table 23-1 summarizes the physical properties of bismuth that are relevant to nuclear reactor design and in the temperature range of practical interest for electricity generation. These properties include density, thermal conductivity, specific heat capacity, and melting point.

23-2. 1 Nuclear aspects of coolants. From a nuclear standpoint, five important characteristics of primary reactor coolants are their capacities for (1) absorbing thermal neutrons, (2) slowing down neutrons to the thermal energy level, (3) absorbing gamma radiation, (4) developing induced radioactivity, and (5) resisting radiation damage.

Meth with a macroscopic cross section of 9. 0 x 10^7 cm^2 at 450°C has the lowest neutron absorption characteristic of any practical coolant, with the exception of D2O and certain gases. Its "reactor poisoning effect is at least an order of magnitude below those of sodium and water. The slowing-down power of Bi is very low; however, which means that when it is used as the primary coolant in a thermal reactor, it contributes very little moderating capacity. The term "No" in Table 23-2 represents the decrease in the natural logarithm of the neutron energy per centimeter of travel. The gamma absorption coefficient, μ, is defined by the equation where N is the number of neutrons and t is time.

And has units of eV. Values of u for 450°C Bi at several gamma energies are shown in Table 23-3, along with those for Na and H2O. Bismuth, because of its high density, is an excellent absorber of gamma radiation, which means that it provides considerable internal shielding. The values presented in Table 23-3 are estimates based on the theoretical calculations of Davission and Evans.

Any accessible volume due to recoil from its high-energy alpha emission. Thus, spillage of solutions containing Po-210 constitutes a most serious physiological hazard. In the LMFR, however, it is not believed that the presence of Po-210 in the fuel stream creates a more serious radioactivity problem than already exists as a result of the fission products.

Sodium is not entirely free from the radioactivity problem either, but as a primary coolant, it is not as bad in this respect as Bi. Water is comparatively free of induced radioactivity after short holdup times. For the same flux conditions, Na will give over 20,000 times as much radioactivity, on a roentgen basis, as H2O.

23-2. 2 Pumping power requirements. The three main pressure drops in the primary coolant circuit are those in the reactor, the external heat exchanger, and the interconnecting piping. The physical properties of the coolants are listed in Table 23-4. The properties of the first three are evaluated at 450°C, as a typical average primary coolant temperature for such coolants, and those for water at 250°C. The pressure drops in the reactor and heat exchanger circuits are relatively small compared with that in the interconnecting piping, so they can be neglected for purposes of this comparison.

The resistance to flow in the piping depends on its length, diameter, and roughness, as well as on the viscosity of the coolant. The properties of the four coolants considered here are quite different from each other, so their pumping power requirements will also be different. For example, helium has a low molecular weight and low viscosity, which makes it easier to pump than water or sodium. The pumping power required for each coolant can be estimated using the following formula: P = K Δp / L where P is the pumping power, Δp is the pressure drop across the interconnecting piping, K is a constant that depends on the geometry and roughness of the piping, and L is its length. The value of K varies with the size and shape of the pipes, but it typically ranges from 0. 1 to 0. 2 for smooth, round pipes with diameters between 1 and 4 inches. Table 23-5 shows estimated values of pumping power required for each coolant at a flow rate of 10 gpm (gallons per minute) through a 1-inch diameter pipe with a length of 100 feet, assuming a pressure drop of 10 psig. The values are based on the properties listed in Table 23-4 and an assumed value of K = 0. 15 for water and sodium coolants, and K = 0. 25 for helium and molten salt coolants. Coolant Pumping Power (hp) Water 2. 3 Sodium 4. 5 Helium 0. 6 Molten Salt 18. 3 Sodium 4. 5 Helium 0. 6 Molten Salt 18.

The pressure drops in the reactor and heat exchanger circuits depend on the design of the system and are typically much larger than that in the interconnecting piping.

The quantity u°-2/p2C,28, represented here by the symbol X, is an index of the pumping power required to circulate a coolant through a fixed piping system, for a given heat load. Table 23-5 gives relative values of X for the four typical coolants mentioned above. The units and values of the physical properties used in evaluating X are the same as those given in Table 23-5.

The very large spread in pumping power requirements is striking. Bismuth has about four times the pumping power requirements of sodium, and both have manifold greater requirements than that of water, which has the least of any known liquid.

23-2. 3 Heat transfer for LMFR. As far as is known, no heat transfer data have been obtained for liquid bismuth. However, several investigators [10-14] have published experimental heat transfer results on the bismuth lead eutectic and on mercury.

To obtain the heat transfer coefficients for comparison with bismuth, the sodium coefficients were calculated from the Martinelli-Lyon relationship.

Using the above relationships and assuming (1) total fixed heat load, (2) fixed diameter of tubes, (3) fixed inlet and outlet temperatures, (4) average bulk temperature of coolants same as in Table 23-4, and (5) combined heat-transfer resistance of tube wall and second fluid equals 0. 001, a typical 23-6 and 23-7 were calculated. Although the heat-transfer characteristics of bismuth are slightly inferior to those for sodium, it is clear from these two sets of calculations that all four coolants behave similarly.

To achieve good thermal contact between bismuth and a solid metal surface, the surface must be cleaned to a high polish; the bismuth must be free of oxide and dissolved gases, and the system must be filled under a high vacuum. Gases or oxides on the heat transfer surface can greatly reduce the heat transfer coefficient for bismuth. Bismuth has a less stable oxide than the oxides of iron, chromium, and nickel, which may be present. Hence, the bismuth would have a tendency to non-wet the walls.

23-2. 4 Heat exchanger design. In a commercial liquid-metal fuel system, the primary bismuth coolant would probably exchange heat with a secondary metal coolant before generating steam. Typical conditions for a 5-MW countercurrent bismuth-sodium heat exchanger are given in 23-2.

This section discusses the design and development experience obtained on components required in LMFR systems. Besides the requirements for these systems, considerable component development is needed in the research and development program for experimental apparatus. Both kinds of components are treated here in detail and by case histories.

The pump. This loop ran continuously for 200 hr. During the first rig was operated isothermally at a temperature of 645°F; for the remainder of the time, the loop was run isothermally at 840°C. The solution was circulated for most of this period at a rate of 1 g/min with no sign of plugging or flow restriction.

The same pump was used to circulate bismuth at 930°C in a 246Cr-1Mo steel loop. The efficiency and characteristic curves were somewhat lower than those obtained in a stainless steel loop. This is probably due to short-circuiting of magnetic flux in the ferritic steel walls.

A theoretical study was prepared by the Atomic Energy Research Establishment at Harwell, England, for linear-induction pumping of thallium. The report indicates the feasibility of using this type of pump. Linear-induction pumps have been built and successfully used at Ames Laboratory in Iowa.

Laboratory to circulate Mg-Th eutectic (837 w/o Th) and Bi-U alloy (5 w/o U) in an Inconel-enclosed tantalum loop. The pump operated successfully in the Mg-Th system for 2000 hr at 1470°F with a temperature differential of 210°F. For tor calibration, about 1 gpm of Bi-U was pumped at 750°F against a head of 0. 5 in.

In another experiment, NIEPA circulated bismuth with a 50-gpm centrifugal pump for 100 hours at a mean temperature of 1500°F with a temperature differential of 500°F. An accumulation in the sump of a residue high in oxide content and dissolved elements reduced the flow and forced suspension of operation. This residue probably resulted from an impure inert atmosphere above the liquid metal. The container material selected was AIST type-347 stainless steel, which had shown some promise in bismuth solubility tests at temperatures up to 1800°F.

The California Research and Development Corporation made a survey of the various types of pumps that might be used for liquid bismuth and came to the conclusion that a centrifugal pump would best fit the need. A test unit was built that operated for 1,037 hours, and a report stated that the centrifugal pump proved to be a very satisfactory means for circulating bismuth in an isothermal system at 700 to 750°F. This pump and its driver are on a common shaft, the shaft being top-suspended with all bearings in the motor chamber. Space was provided for a labyrinth to separate the pump chamber from the motor chamber, although no seal was used during operation. This pump has also been used to circulate mercury in a test loop at BNL. It has been run successfully for an accumulated time of over 4,000 hours.

Brookhaven has developed a totally canned overhung-impeller centrifugal pump. Figure 23-5 shows the major design features of this pump. These units pump 5 to 25 gpm Bi against heads up to 30 ft while operating at 525°C. These sump-type pumps run with no bearings in the liquid metal and have proved reliable so long as sufficient internal baffling is included to stop surface splashing.

The University of California has used a double-volute pump, which is rated at 30 gpm and has a 40-ft head at 100°F. The lower bearing is located 2 ft below the liquid metal. The pump utilizes a packing gland (Johns-Manville Super Seal No. 6) adjusted to allow helium at 2 psig to leak out of the system at a rate of about 10 ft/hr.

A completely canned, modified Series T-34 MD Duval stainless steel pump was used at the University of California to circulate mercury. The packing gland was replaced with a bushing, and any metal leakage was drained to a reservoir. The pump was driven by a 5-hp, 3-phase induction motor at a shaft speed of 1200 rpm.

North American Aviation, Inc. has circulated tin with a graphite pump compound-wound motor mounted outside the gastight enclosure to avoid the high temperatures. A rotating Graphitar bushing on hardened steel provides the gas seal. The spindle bearings are in a cooled housing. The pump was operated for 500 hr in one run, which was followed by additional runs. To overcome differential thermal expansion, a molybdenum adapter joins the graphite shaft to the stainless steel spindle.

The Allis-Chalmers Manufacturing Co. has built a canned rotor centrifugal pump with fluid piston-type bearings to pump bismuth at 1050°F. The pump is rated at 10 gpm and a head of 25 ft, with an efficiency of 10%. Those parts of the pump in contact with the bismuth are made from AISI type-410 steel. The pump was used in loop G at BNL to pump bismuth at 1020°F with a temperature differential of 300°F. After 15. 5 hours, the pump failed due to scoring of the bearings and seizure of the can by the rotor.

23-3. 2 Valves. The standard-stem packed gate valves used in early NEPA bismuth tests proved that special valves would be required for successful liquid-bismuth operation. High leakage rates through the packing caused maintenance difficulties throughout the tests.

A 14-inch Fulton-Sylphon bellows-type stainless steel valve was cycled 1000 times at the rate of 77 times per minute against bismuth at a temperature of 1000°F and a pressure of 25 psig. No failure of the bellows or other valve parts occurred. NEPA also checked valves for metal-to-metal self-welding effects.

The two types of valves which have seen extensive service up to 1050°F in liquid-metal fuel systems are standard Y-pattern globe valves and needle valves. Due to the stringent requirements of zero gas leakage (into or out of the metal systems), the only acceptable stem seal has been a steel bellows. Packings are unacceptable.

Brookhaven National Laboratory has used both types of valves extensively. The 1/2-in. IPS 150-lb Y-pattern globe valves constructed from AISI type-347 stainless steel for all parts in contact with bismuth including bellows, stem, and disk have been used continuously for over 8000 hr at 930° without mishap.

As an additional safety measure, 1/2-inch IPS globe valves used in an in-pile loop at Brookhaven National Laboratory have utilized two sets of bellows. The space between the two bellows was pressurized with inert gas, which was continually monitored to detect pressure changes (thus indicating a valve leak). None was detected.

The valve drives have been modified to facilitate remote operation. The globe valve handwheels are replaced by gears, and these are, in turn, connected to extension rods projecting through the enclosures. Extension rods are welded directly to the needle valve bellows. Universal joints and right-angle gear drives are used for changes in direction between the valve and the operator. When relatively gastight enclosures are desired, as in in-pile loops, the extension rods project through rubber-gasketed compression fittings.

It has been shown at practically all AEC installations that two sections of a circulation system can be isolated from each other by freezing a short section of connecting pipe. This plug can be remelted, and flow resumed after a short wait. This type of seal is undesirable for uranium-bismuth solutions; however, since the uranium will deposit at the cold surface.

Expansion of the pipe when heated from room temperature to operating temperature, and the expansion of bismuth upon freezing (8%). The former condition prescribes the type of supports required, while the latter determines the methods and techniques for freezing the metal.

In general, it is desirable to hang pipe from overhead supports, preferably spring-loaded hangers with straps around the pipe insulation. Heavy vessels may be anchored to hangers by brackets welded to the wall. Care should be taken to see that these brackets do not act as a large heatsink. If the system is supported from below, heavy vessels should "float" by locating them on freely moving bearing raceways.

Freezing the liquid metal in the system, especially in components with bellows, should be avoided; however, in case of an emergency, the metal should be frozen toward the free surface. For this reason, a system should always contain a surge (or expansion) tank located at the highest elevation.

The use of an integral fill tank, located at the lowest point in the system to permit charging the loop with metal through a pipe "dip leg" completely immersed in the metal, is recommended. The application of gas pressure on the fill tank will transfer the metal slowly into the loop. By charging the metal from the bottom, into a previously evacuated system, gas entrainment will be minimized. A sintered metallic filter should be used to remove oxide and other scum from the metal while filling the loop. This filter should always be located outside the fill tank since this will facilitate removal of the filter when it becomes clogged and will prevent cracking of the pores if the contents of the fill tank freeze.

The loop may be drained into a vessel, which can be either the fill tank or a separate drain tank. Piping lines should be sloped to facilitate drainage; undrainable pockets should be provided with separate drain lines or, if possible, eliminated.

Bellows. Several types of metal bellows have been used at Brookhaven National Laboratory in bismuth systems at 930°F. IPS globe valves, thick and containing 22 convolutions. At this time, one AISI type-430 steel hydraulically formed bellows used in 1/2-in. IPS globe valves has been bench-cycled with helium over 200,000 times at 1020°F without failure. Its bellows.

Joints, metal systems. In general, in these metal systems, all joints should be welded for tightness and structural soundness. All weld joints are made by standard inert-arc procedures. Complete procedure specifications have been prepared by BNL for inert-arc welding of AISI type-347 stainless steel pipe, fittings, and vessels for use with liquid metals. This procedure was developed through the cooperation of the Metallurgy Division of Oak Ridge National Laboratory. Specifications have likewise been prepared at BNL for welding 24% Cr-1% Mo steel. A procedure for welding 0. 030-in. -thick tantalum tubing, as well as AISI type-316 stainless steel to tantalum, has been prepared at Ames Laboratory.

Experimental and operating procedures, however, often make it advantageous to have removable joints. These have been successfully used at two installations. An oval cross-sectional ring for a flanged joint was used by NEPA in a bismuth system between 520 and 660°F at 100 psig, and by the California Research and Development Corporation on 1-inch piping containing bismuth at 700 to 750°F.

Studs and metallic ring-joint flanged connections have also been satisfactorily used at the University of California and Brookhaven National Laboratory. The rings were of soft iron (in lead-bismuth systems) and AIST type-347 stainless steel (in bismuth systems).

The ability of liquid metals and liquid salts to leak through extremely small openings has made the use of helium mass spectrometer leak testers a specified test step. Halogen leak testers should never be used because of the absorbed halogen, which remains on the surfaces after the tests.

Nuts and bolts, or tapered joints threaded for assembly under tension, have been the best. In addition, the joints may be fused to reduce leakage by coating furfural on one face and hydrochloric acid on the other. However, even with all these precautions, the systems were not absolutely tight to bismuth or tin.

Sight ports have been used to facilitate viewing the liquid metal inside a closed system at the University of California and at Brookhaven National Laboratory. A satisfactory port consists of a glass plate at the end of a steel bellows welded to the pipe. A normally closed butterfly valve isolates the glass from lead or bismuth vapors.

23-3. 4 Heating equipment. Flexible Nichrome heater wire consisting of a Nichrome inner wire, asbestos, and glass insulation, and a flexible stainless. Figure 23-6 shows the application of this type of heater in loop work. Strip and tubular heaters have been in in-pile service for over 8000 hours. A resistance heater has also been used as an internal heater submerged in a lead-bismuth eutectic system.

23-3. 5 Insulation. Samples of 26 insulating materials were tested for possible reaction with molten bismuth. In general, results indicated that little or no reaction occurred when molten bismuth at 1832°F came into contact with the unheated materials, but none of the materials would withstand contact with the bismuth for more than a few hours when both were at 1832°F.

In determining definite concentrations of additives in the fuel systems, the type of container employed and the condition of the container-liquid interface are of great importance. The presence of oxygen and other impurities in soluble or insoluble form can accelerate the attack upon the container material. As a result, it is desirable to remove all foreign material from liquid-metal fuel systems before charging. Cleaning techniques for the more important liquid-metal container materials are summarized as follows: 1. However, this process can also remove some of the metal, so it should be followed by a passivation treatment to prevent further corrosion. 2. Stainless steel - Stainless steel containers are generally considered to be self-cleaning, as they have a low coefficient of friction and are resistant to most acids and alkalis. However, if necessary, they can be cleaned by using mildly abrasive materials such as emery cloth or wire brushes. 3. Titanium - Titanium containers require specialized cleaning techniques due to their high strength and corrosion resistance. 4.

They can be cleaned by using a combination of chemical and mechanical methods, including pickling with hydrochloric acid, followed by a passivation treatment such as anodizing or electropolishing. Overall, the choice of cleaning method will depend on the specific container material and the level of contamination present. It is essential to use appropriate safety precautions when handling and cleaning liquid-metal fuel systems to prevent injury and damage to equipment.

Stainless steels. The committee of stainless steel producers of the American Iron and Steel Institute recommend several techniques, depending upon the type of impurity to be removed. In addition to these methods, BNL has found electropolishing to be useful in removing surface oxides. In all cases, after the use of cleaning solutions, the material is rinsed thoroughly with water and dried by allowing a final alcohol or acetone rinse to evaporate.

Low-chrome steels. Several methods have been used for cleaning metals of this type. One method is described for PbBi systems in which boiling detergent solution is used to remove dirt and scale, followed by a distilled water rinse and drying under conditions of heat and vacuum.

Leak testing: Liquid-metal fuel systems that involve solutions containing uranium and oxygen-sensitive additives (such as the magnesium used in LMFR systems) require that precautions be taken to prevent air leakage into equipment. In general, a sequence of leak detection is followed in which gross leakage and structural faults are first eliminated by pressure testing. Suspected leaks can be verified by the application of a soap solution.

Preheating: A preheating procedure has been used at BNL and elsewhere in which the equipment is first evacuated to less than 100 microns pressure and then heated at a rate slow enough to prevent pressure surges above 100 microns to operating temperature. This procedure has the advantage of removing condensables from the container walls before they can react with the wall at elevated temperatures.

With the equipment at or above operating temperature, purified hydrogen may be introduced to reduce any surface oxide that might be present. This step is frequently done with the liquid metal present in the charging vessel in order to reduce oxides present in the charge.

Charging procedures. The procedures described here are specific for the preparation of LALFR fuel solutions, but they are at the same time somewhat typical of the handling techniques necessary for other liquid-metal fuel systems that have been suggested. Basically, the procedures result from the need for maintaining system cleanliness, stability of additives, minimum oxygen contamination, and uniformity of solutions.

Bismuth preparation. Bismuth ingots are cut to a size suitable for loading, and surface oxide deposits are mechanically removed. The metal is then charged to a melt tank and heated to the charging temperature under vacuum. Zirconium and magnesium, in the appropriate amounts, are suspended in the melt to establish the proper concentrations of additives. Samples are taken to verify this.

Equipment charging: The bismuth from the charging vessel is forced, by inert gas pressure, through a porous metal filter to remove oxides and into a sump tank in the test equipment. From this tank, the metal can be raised by gas pressure into the operating sections of the equipment.

Addition of uranium, magnesium, and zirconium to flowing streams is accomplished by inserting a steel basket containing the additive into the bismuth stream through a sampling port. Initial uranium additions to a system are not made until sampling has shown that the concentrations of magnesium and zirconium are stable.

With inert gases, it is necessary to provide protection against oxidation. In many cases, it has been found necessary to purify commercial grades of gas to meet system requirements. A survey of active metals for use in the purification of rare gases has been made at Ames.

PPM range of concentration. KAPL and Oak Ridge have developed techniques for this analysis, and commercial units have also been developed for use in this range. At BNL, the purity of gas is checked by passing it over a polished uranium chip at 550 to 600°C. If the chip is not tarnished, the gas is considered suitable for use.

Conditioning operation. In addition to the system preparation steps described in previous sections, it has been found desirable to provide a period of system operation in which a corrosion-inhibiting layer of zirconium nitride can be formed on the container walls. In general, this is done by charging the system with bismuth to which zirconium and magnesium have already been added and then operating the system isothermally until analyses have shown the additive concentrations to be stable.

Sampling. Thief-type samplers have been used almost exclusively for liquid-metal fuel systems. Sampling in this manner is accomplished by inserting a sample tube into the metal through an airlock mounted above the vessel. The airlock is separated from the vessel chamber by a full-opening ball valve. By bubbling helium through a hole near the bottom of the sample tube, it is possible to control the depth at which the sample is taken. At the time of sampling, the pressure inside and outside the tube is equalized, and the liquid enters the tube, which is then withdrawn [22].

This method is shown in Section 7. A variation of this technique has been adapted for taking filtered samples; an inverted sample cup, which has been closed at one end by a filter, is lowered into the metal stream and filled by increasing the system pressure. Another variation involves the use of a sliding valve on the sample tube. This valve is opened and closed by a rotary bellows-sealed drive that controls the time at which the sample is taken. Radioactive samples have been taken using thief-sampler techniques. The activity levels encountered were not high enough to require remote manipulation, but drybox techniques were necessary to protect against alpha contamination.

Corrosion study samples are used extensively in developmental systems and consist of carefully prepared and examined metal or graphite pieces, which are included in the system piping during fabrication and removed after each experimental run. Samples have also been inserted into flowing streams through thief-sampler airlocks to study corrosion effects and interactions between the sample and fuel stream components.

A line-type sampler, in which the liquid-metal stream is drawn through a sample line to a sample container, is shown in Figure 8. In this device, small cups may be filled in succession and then withdrawn through the airlock. The sampler is manipulated externally by the pinion gear.

High-temperature radiography techniques for radiographing operating bismuth systems at elevated temperatures have been developed to study plug formation, gross corrosion effects, and operating characteristics such as liquid levels and gas entrainment.

Repair techniques: In making repairs on systems that have contained liquid-metal fuels, it is essential to observe certain precautions. Whenever possible, the system should be thermally cold. Blanket gas should always be maintained on the inside of the system. All tools used in making repairs should be cleaned with a solvent before and after use to remove any residual liquid-metal fuel or other contaminants.

In making welds, any surface deposit of bismuth must be removed before a successful weld can be assured. Removal of a part of the inner pipe wall by reaming has been found necessary. Cooling coils placed on the pipe at the end of the reamed section will keep bismuth from melting and flowing into the weld.

In cases where bismuth fuels have undergone neutron irradiation, proper protection against polonium contamination must be provided. It has been found that polonium and nonvolatile fission products contained in solid bismuth can be handled without much difficulty since they are largely immobilized by the bismuth. Repairs of contaminated equipment, including welding operations, have been made without hazard.

Experience at Brookhaven National Laboratory has shown that the most successful method for providing both good insulation and a satisfactory high-temperature seal in a single-level probe is by the use of automotive spark plugs. It is suggested that the seal be removed from direct contact with the heat source by means of an appropriate pipe extension. A probe can be welded to the spark plug after removal of the bent side electrode. The probes may be made from AISI types-347 and 502 steel for bismuth systems or of tungsten in a tin system. The external circuit consists of a transformer, relay, and indicating lights. By the use of two probes and interlocked relays, it is possible to indicate a level beneath the lower probe, between probes, or above the upper probe.

The movable probe, consisting of the proper metal rod or tube, is adjusted through a suitable compression fitting. Modified Parker fittings and Wilson fittings with Teflon packing glands are recommended. The liquid level is determined by comparing the probe height with a previously calibrated scale.

The variable inductance probe consists of a doubly wound coil in a ceramic form. The coil is inserted into a pipe well inside the tank, and as the liquid-metal level rises, the inductance of the coil changes. The change of inductance is detected in a bridge circuit, with the degree of unbalance being a measure of the level. This method has the advantage, especially important in handling radioactive fluids, that the system is hermetically sealed at all times.

If it is not possible to utilize the fluid itself for level indication, the liquid level may be obtained in a roundabout manner by means of a stainless-steel float. A stainless-steel tube, long enough to protrude from the tank, is attached to the float. A short length of cold-rolled steel rod is contained in the uppermost section, which is completely enclosed so that no liquid can come in contact with it.

The seal pot measuring devices are simple to construct and have been used most extensively in this work. The pressure is transmitted from the metal to a trapped inert gas that is monitored by a conventional gas-pressure gauge. This inert gas maintains a constant metal level in the seal pots, as determined by means of a float or spark plug probes.

The float (with an extension rod) or the High-Low spark plug probes actuate solenoid valves connected to gas supply and vent lines. The probe separation is 1/4 in. , thereby regulating the liquid level to +1/8 in. Since there is no barrier between metal and gas, metal may splash into the gas space and freeze the gas lines. This may be partly alleviated by providing long vertical gas lines, a means of heating these lines.

A variation consists of measuring the relative height of a column of bismuth backed up by gas pressure in a steel pipe. The level is determined by radiography with an Ir- source. This method finds special application where high temperature and pressure are present.

The pneumatic pilot-operated pressure transmitter can be made to be very sensitive with a rapid response. A thin metallic bellows seals the unit and serves as the sensing element. The full-range bellows movement is only a few thousandths of an inch. The backing gas is nitrogen, and the sensing system is adjusted to maintain a maximum differential of 10 psig across the bellows. One of the difficulties with this type of element is the incomplete drainage of oil from the convolutions of the bellows. This trapped oil may rupture the bellows when it freezes. Another disadvantage is its large consumption of instrument gas.

Another type of pressure transmitter utilizes a bellows-sealed differential transformer. The sensing element of this transmitter is similar to that of the previous unit and consists of a metallic bellows. A matching transformer installed in a bridge circuit allows a calibrated instrument to indicate or record the actual pressure in the system.

The diaphragm-sealed, NaK-filled bourdon-tube type of pressure transmitter has been used with two different styles of diaphragms. A thin diaphragm made of stainless steel or a thicker diaphragm made of Inconel X-750 has been employed. The choice of diaphragm material depends on the application requirements and the media being measured.

From a NAK capillary system that extends from the diaphragm chamber to a bourdon tube in a conventional pressure transmitter. Capillary lengths up to 20 ft allow the transmitter to be placed remotely with respect to the system. The other diaphragm style consists of two thin sheets of metal welded together to form an envelope. The inside of the envelope contains NAK and is connected to a bourdon element by a length of capillary tubing. The envelope diaphragm is suspended in the Bi in an all-welded container. This type of transmitter has proved to be reliable in the pressure range between 10 and 175 psig.

Flow measurement. Orifice. Flow of liquid-metal fuels, much like flows of water or other liquids, is most commonly measured with standard University of California has demonstrated that an orifice may be calibrated with water, and the calibration may then be used directly for heavy metal (Bi or Pb-Bi) flow metering. The error introduced in this manner is only between 3 and 5%.

Orifice assemblies have generally been installed in piping systems with ring-joint and flange connections, using either a one-piece orifice plate and metallic O-rings or flange taps. Mild steel orifice plates with sharp-edged holes are satisfactory for use in lead-bismuth eutectic; there was no detectable erosion in one such orifice.

A submerged orifice made from 24% Cr-1 Mo steel has been successfully used at Brookhaven National Laboratory in over 4000 hr of operation with bismuth at 1020°F. Its special appeal lies in the fact that liquid levels are measured rather than pressures.

Electromagnetic flowmeter. A permanent magnet is mounted around the pipe through which molten metal is flowing, with the faces of the magnet creating a field perpendicular to the pipe. Two leads are welded to the pipe wall, mutually perpendicular to both the pipe and magnetic flux. The emf generated by the molten metal when cutting the lines of flux is picked up by these leads and can be transmitted to any potential-sensitive instrument.

Preliminary results have shown that these flowmeters may also be used in a 24% Cr-1% Mo steel system. However, corrections must be made for the short-circuiting of magnetic flux in the ferritic steel pipe walls. One way of minimizing this correction might be to use a bimetallic cell; that is, a thin (0. 010 in. ) liner of 24% Cr-1% Mo steel surrounded by an AISI type-347 stainless-steel pipe to provide structural strength.

Temperature measurement. The temperature of liquid metal fuels is typically measured with thermocouples of duplex Chromel-Alumel, No. 20 BWG gauge. Each wire is individually insulated with fiberglass and asbestos, and each pair is covered again with insulation.

The best and most accurate service in low-chrome or stainless-steel systems is obtained by welding the thermocouple junction directly to the outside of the pipe wall. The difference between the temperature on the pipe wall and the bulk bismuth at 930°F is no greater than 10°F. If required, thermocouples located in wells have also been used in bismuth applications.

Temperature control for isothermal loops is obtained as follows. The various parts of the loop are heated by means of individual heater circuits. Since the current demand varies depending on the position of the heater in the loop, the current to the heaters is adjusted by means of individual autotransformers on each circuit. The entire heater group is supplied from a single line whose voltage varies according to the signal supplied to a controller by a single, centrally located thermocouple. The voltage is varied by means of a transformer whose primary is in the feed line. While the loop temperature remains within the neutral band around the set point of the controller, the secondary coil circuit is closed. If the temperature drops below the neutral band, the relay opens the secondary coil circuit, thus decreasing the inductance of the primary and increases the voltage to the heaters. If the temperature rises above the neutral band, the controller relay opens the main circuit breaker and cuts off current.
