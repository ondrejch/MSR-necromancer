Selective freezing of fuel salt in the drain tanks could permit the MSRE core to be filled with concentrated fuel, and premature criticality could occur. This situation was studied for the case of fuel containing no thorium. Insertion of rods near the time the core first became critical would, however, keep the reactor subcritical for a time sufficient to stop the fuel addition. Stopping the addition would limit the fuel temperature rise to less than 25°F.

Expressions were obtained relating the reactivity effects of Xe-135 to the reactor conditions and the xenon spatial distribution. For the MSRE and highly enriched uranium fuel, a reactivity decrease of about 0. 6% was associated with an effective xenon poison fraction of 1%.

Calculations were made of the reactivity effects associated with graphite shrinkage, fuel soak-up, and uncertainties in salt and graphite densities. For highly enriched uranium fuel, a 0. 34% increase in reactivity was associated with a 1% increase in average salt density. 53%. 18%.

Two INOR-8 freeze-flange joints for 5-inch-diameter schedule-40 pipe were successfully tested: one in the thermal-cycling test loop and the other in the pump testing facility.

In the control of the transfer valve, which is typical of all MSRE valves, except the reactor drain valve, the reactor drain valve differs in the orientation of its flat surface and in the presence of a concentric emergency drain line inside the valve proper. The extra conduction of this line resulted in a larger temperature difference between the center of the valve and the surface during the freezing transient, requiring that the automatic controls be set at a lower temperature than desired. Insulation of the thermocouple area is being tried as a solution to this.

The design and fabrication of a prototype control rod drive were subcontracted, and work on the drive was started. Two types of flexible control rods were tested under realistic operating conditions. Excessive wear at the bends of the guide thimble was solved by the installation of rollers. Exact positioning of the bottom of the rod remains a problem.

The prototype cooling bayonets for removing fuel afterheat from the MSRE drain tank were thermally shock-tested a total of 2257 times without failure. Six of the ten reactor-grade thermocouples were still intact after this very severe test.

Fabrication of the sampler-enricher system mockup and installation into the engineering test loop is nearing completion. Difficulties with the sealing of the flanged disconnect were traced to stresses produced during fabrication and were solved by annealing.

Operation of the full-scale MSRE core model with water at 85°F was continued to make preliminary measurements of the internal flow distribution and pressure drop through the core. The difference in flow between mutually perpendicular channels was reduced by drilling holes in the support lattice directly under the starved channels. The small radial dependence of flow was determined as beneficial in giving a more uniform temperature rise of the fuel.

The engineering test loop was placed into operation after successful pretreatment of graphite with vacuum and heat, and after treatment of the operating salt with H₂ and HF to remove oxygen. The graphite container access joint seal was operated in a manner to reduce the heat removed from the joint.

A procedure for the remote replacement of a freeze flange gasket was demonstrated. Two men completed the replacement in 8 hours, and it was estimated that the replacement would require an additional 24 hours in the reactor. Additional tools were designed and are being fabricated for the maintenance of freeze flange FF-100 under its special conditions.

Operation of the prototype fuel pump in molten salt was resumed, and the testing program was reinstated. A water test of the fuel pump was also run to determine the value of the radial force on the impeller for several pump operating conditions of interest. Endurance testing of the lubrication pump and the PKP fuel pump with molten salt was continued.

Developmental testing of a continuous liquid-level-indicating element for use in measuring the molten salt level in the MSRE pump bowl was continued. Performance of two units is still satisfactory after one year of operation at temperatures between 900 and 1300°F.

A developmental temperature-scanning system was operated satisfactorily for 3000 hours. At the end of this period, the system began generating excessive noise pulses. The noise was determined to be due to oxidation of mercury in the lower switch deck.

After 3000 hours of operation on the MSRE Experiment Test Loop, drift of six similar thermocouples remained at less than +2°F after 8000 hours at 1200 to 1250°F. Five out of ten thermocouples are still functioning after 2050 severe thermal cycles.

Data obtained from tests of MSRE prototype surface-mounted thermocouples on the MSRE pump test loop indicated that the thermocouples are greatly influenced by the heaters. The thermocouples could not be used for computation of reactor heat power or for precise measurement of the mean reactor temperature unless the heater power was maintained constant, and a correction was made for bias in the thermocouple reading.

No significant changes were made in the design concept or in the detail of any component or system. Design work, except for instrumentation, was essentially completed, and a design report giving all engineering calculations and analyses of the system is being compiled.

Additional instrument application flow diagrams for the chemical processing system, the fuel loading and storage system, and the instrument air distribution system were completed. Tabulations and application diagrams were revised to incorporate recent design changes.

Preliminary control system block diagrams were prepared, and criteria for control and safety circuitry are being reviewed. The design of instrument and control system panels is approximately 85% complete, and panel fabrication is 50% complete. Interconnection wiring designs for the annunciator system and for the Foxboro Electronic Control Instrumentation System are nearing completion. Design work on thermocouple interconnections is underway. Location and attachment drawings for thermocouples in the fuel and coolant system and a tabulation of the 819 thermocouples in the reactor system were completed.

Fabrication drawings for drain tank salt level probes and for oil system venturi flow elements were completed. Requirements for process radiation monitors were established, and design work on field installations for these monitors is in progress. Panel design is nearing completion. Design work on personnel monitoring installations is underway.

An analog simulation of the reactor fill and drain system indicated that the use of restrictors in the bypass lines between drain tanks and the pump bowl would reduce pump bowl pressure transients during a dump to an acceptable level without an objectionable increase in the time required to complete a dump.

All modifications to Building 7503, which will house the MSRE, were completed. Fabrication of the fuel system flush tank, the coolant salt storage tank, and the steam dome, and bayonet tube assemblies for the drain tank coolant system was completed. Other components are approximately 85% complete.

A full-scale sample heat exchanger was successfully fabricated to test previously developed welding and brazing procedures. The 52 welded and brazed tube-to-tube sheet joints exhibited good weld soundness and complete brazes. Ultrasonic inspection techniques for the tube brazes were correlated with metallographic studies, and a 3/32-inch-diameter flat-bottom reference hole was selected as the standard for evaluating brazing of the MSRE heat exchanger. The MSRE heat exchanger core was successfully assembled and welded.

The CGB graphite bars produced for the MSRE moderator were found to meet specifications, except that there were cracks, and some bars had densities as low as 1. 82 g/cm³. Despite these conditions, the graphite was found to have good mechanical strength and low permeation when exposed to salt. The salt permeation of cracked CGB graphite was tested at 150 psig and 1300°F and was found to be less than 0. 1% of the bulk volume. Rapid thermal cycling between 390 and 1300°F did not damage the graphite or cause salt-impregnated cracks to propagate. The tensile strength was found to range from 5440 to 6500 psi when tested as a round bar or a ring. The strength of severely cracked specimens was as low as 1500 psi; however, the material did not demonstrate notch sensitivity.

Sample control rod elements were tested in the control rod testing rig. They were thermally and mechanically stressed for 600 hours through approximately 11,000 cycles. The hot-pressed Gd2O3-Al2O3 cylinders cracked during this testing but did not crumble, and the metal container.

Cold-pressed and sintered cylinders of Gd2O3-Al2O3 mixtures containing 30 wt% Al2O3 were prepared by working with pre-reacted powder that had 95% of the calculated density. Shrinkage behavior at successive sintering temperatures caused distortion, apparently because of the formation of intermediate compounds by a peritectic reaction. The use of a pre-reacted Gd2O3-Al2O3 holding fixture was found to resolve the distortion problem.

The source of the previously encountered F2 in the cover gas of sealed capsules examined after an exposure of 107 neutrons/cm was discovered in recent irradiation experiments. The fluorine was evolved from the frozen fuel at room temperature as a consequence of radiation damage to the crystals.

Examinations of sealed capsules from earlier exposures were continued. The results served chiefly to confirm previously reported preliminary findings and surmises. Analyses of gas samples that were accumulated in capsules operating at MSRE conditions gave reassuringly negative results in regard to the evolution of CF4. Results from all experiments, including gas analyses from a variety of operating conditions, make a strong case for the presence of CF4 only as a secondary consequence of F2 production. The absence of evidence of unusual loss of fluorine in any form from the fissioning fuel at high temperatures was firmly established and confirmed both thermodynamic predictions and the conclusions from irradiation tests since the earliest work on molten salt reactors. The post-exposure evolution of F2 from the solids, which even yet has not always occurred when it might be expected, was generally not identified when present in earlier hot cell examinations, presumably because the gas phase usually escaped and was never analyzed. Fluorine was undoubtedly associated with an earlier instance of an unidentified smoke that was noted when loop sections containing irradiated fuel were segmented.

Further confirmation was obtained of the adequacy of proposed MSRE startup procedures for removing moisture from graphite. Physically held water was driven off near 100°C, and a small burst of more strongly bound water was evolved near 400°C in a roughly reproducible pattern that was only slightly altered by changes in the heating rate.

An experimental study of the reaction of CF4 with fuel mixtures reduced by the addition of zirconium turnings showed that the CF4 reacted with the reduced fuel at an accelerated rate when admitted to the fuel through a hollow graphite cylinder immersed in the fuel. The reasons for this behavior are not yet fully established.

Experimental investigations involving fluorine were facilitated by the use of a new manifold for regulating and controlling the flow of fluorine gas. For example, XeF2 was prepared as required. A facility for the production of pure UF3 was improved.

Four approaches to out-of-pile studies of irradiation-induced evolution of fluorine from solid fluoride fuels are being investigated. Consideration is being given to the use of Van de Graaff electrons, beta radiation from Sr-90, gamma radiation from a Co source, and x-rays from a high-capacity x-ray machine. All these radiation sources are amenable to use over extended salt composition and temperature ranges, and most could be employed on molten salt if necessary.

Work continued on the development and evaluation of methods for analysis of the radioactive MSRE fuel. A hot-cell mockup was used in most of this work, along with actual high-level radiation hot cells, in order to simulate as closely as possible the conditions under which it will be necessary to analyze highly radioactive materials. Improved means of analyzing fuel for oxides were studied.

Work on the detailed design of a fuel-processing system for the MSRE was essentially completed. The locations of the equipment were established, and the flow sheet was changed to route the exit gas from the fluorine disposal system through the caustic scrubber.

The effects of fissioning in frozen fuel can be significant. When nuclear fission occurs within frozen fuel, it can lead to a release of energy that may result in the thawing of the surrounding material. This process can have implications for the structural integrity of the fuel containment system and the overall safety of the nuclear facility.

The filling accident described previously was reanalyzed because it is presently planned that the first charge of fuel will not contain thorium. The accident postulated consisted of premature criticality while the core was being filled with fuel salt containing more than the design amount of uranium. The increase in the uranium concentration could result from selective freezing of the salt in the drain tanks.

In the reanalysis, it was considered that the fuel contained fully enriched uranium (0. 15 mole % U) and no thorium. With this fuel, it was found that control rod action alone was not sufficient to prevent a power excursion for all the cases considered. It would be necessary to stop filling the core because rod insertion would not always prevent the reactor from becoming supercritical and developing excessive temperatures if the filling were completed.

Even with 39% of the fuel frozen in the dump tanks, the core could be completely filled with the remaining fluid. Power and temperature transients were therefore predicted using. Inserting the rods limited the fuel temperature rise during the initial excursion to less than 25°F, and operation of the gas valves stopped the filling in time to prevent a damaging second power excursion. In an extreme case in which it was assumed that one of the three control rods failed to drop and two of the three gas control valves failed to operate, a second excursion resulted from coast-up of the fuel level. In this case, with an assumed initial fill rate of 0.5 cfm, the fuel temperature rise at the hottest point was 150°F, and the final temperature was 75°F above the starting temperature.

Dispersal of coolant through a leak in the radiator would present a health hazard with either type of coolant. The toxicity of NaF determines the maximum permissible concentration of LiF-NaF-KF in the air, and the radioactivity is relatively unimportant.

The total reactivity loss that will result from Xe-135 poisoning during high-power operation of the MSRE will depend both on the total amount and the spatial distribution of xenon in the fuel salt and in pores in the graphite. The reactivity loss and the poison distribution can be related theoretically, and the relation is most conveniently expressed in terms of a reactivity coefficient and an importance-averaged xenon concentration. According to first-order perturbation theory, the weight function for the poison concentration is proportional to the product of the thermal flux, $5, and the thermal flux adjoint, 933 thus.

Where Ne is the importance-averaged concentration per unit reactor volume, Ne and We are the local concentrations per unit volume of graphite and salt, respectively, and the integral limits g, s, and R refer to graphite, salt, and reactor, respectively. The quantity No is also the uniform equilibrium concentration of xenon that produces the same reactivity change as the actual distribution.

Where \( \text{py} \) is the number of neutrons produced per fission and \( X_{12} \) are the macroscopic fission cross-sections for fast (1) and thermal neutrons (2), respectively. Thus, given knowledge of the xenon distribution, determining the xenon reactivity involves three steps, namely, the calculation of \( N_{y} \), \( \text{Pygs} \), and \( \beta / k \) from Eqs. (1), (2), and (3), respectively. Alternatively, these relations may be used in the reverse sense in attempting.

Factors that influence the reactivity effects of graphite and salt density changes are graphite shrinkage, fuel soak-up, and uncertainties in measured values of the densities at design conditions. When changes in the overall dimensions of the core can be neglected, reactivity changes with density may be calculated using a reactivity coefficient and a weighting function that expresses the relative importance of the density change with respect to position. The latter is useful when the density changes occur in a nonuniform manner throughout the core. The calculation is similar to that for determining the temperature coefficient of reactivity. In fact, the temperature coefficient is the sum.

The results given above can be used to calculate the reactivity effects of uncertainties in the measured densities of the materials at design conditions. In order to calculate the effects of graphite shrinkage and fuel soak-up, however, some specific situations must be considered. If shrinkage were uniform in the transverse direction across a graphite stringer and if the center of the stringer remained fixed during contraction, gaps would open between stringers and fill with fuel salt. The homogeneous density of the graphite would remain constant; however, the effective salt density, Ne, would increase. If We and Vg represent volume fractions of salt and graphite in the lattice, the fractional change in salt density would be given by δv = −δVg, and the associated changes in salt density and reactivity would be.

Where f is the fractional decrease in graphite volume as a result of shrinkage (a function of position), and the starred quantities are importance-averaged values of the indicated functions. Equation (8) also applies to the case of fuel soak-up if f is replaced by f*, the fraction of the graphite volume filled with salt.

A 5-inch INOR-8 freeze-flange joint with an oval ring gasket was thermally cycled six times in the pump testing facility. A cycle consists of preheating the facility for 24 hours, introducing the molten salt in 1 hour, circulating the molten salt, and stopping the circulation for 1 hour.

The test in the pump-testing facility was less demanding on the flanged joint than the test in the thermal-cycling facility because of the fewer cycles and generally lower operating temperatures. The flange temperature distributions obtained in the two testing facility systems are compared in section 2.

The prototype control circuit for a prototype freeze valve was installed in the valve test loop for operational testing. The control unit consists of a basic circuit into which several individual off-on modules may be plugged. Each of the five modules for each valve is actuated on a signal from a thermocouple mounted on the valve and serves as a relay to control the valve heater and cooling-air supply. The module set point is adjustable on each unit. The control of each valve is adjusted to produce a specific temperature distribution near the valve for on and off positions, respectively. The results of testing this control circuit on two quite different freeze valves are reported.

Tests have shown that if the airflow is increased without a compensating change in the heat input to the pipe on either side of the frozen zone, the length of the frozen zone will be increased, and there will be an increase in the time required to thaw. If such compensation is made, however, only a small increase in the time required to thaw will result. 75 to 4 min.

Difficulty was encountered in the operation of the mockup of the reactor core drain valve with the control circuitry described above. This valve is located within the core thermal shield, and there is no means for directly controlling the heat on the adjacent piping. It is installed with its flat surface in the vertical plane to facilitate remote maintenance of its heater. There is also a 1/2-inch-diameter emergency drain line installed within this valve that extends from the core tank to a point just below the valve.

Preliminary tests indicated an excessive freezing time, and an X-ray photograph taken with the valve in the frozen condition showed a large void above the frozen zone of the salt. Gas was trapped in this pocket by gravity. The condition was corrected, and the normal 15-minute freeze time was attained by reshaping the upper edge of the valve to eliminate.

The emergency drain line that terminated just below the frozen zone of the valve conducted heat from the upstream molten salt into the freeze-plug area, creating an unbalanced temperature distribution and causing the freeze plug to be displaced. It was necessary, therefore, to direct the air to the upstream side of the valve centerline and to modify the air nozzles to offset the extra heat flow.

Conduction of heat by the emergency drain line into the frozen zone at the valve center also created some difficulty in adjusting the valve shoulder temperature controls in the hold-freeze condition. The thermocouples at this position are surface-mounted and exposed to the cooling airflow and therefore do not indicate the true salt temperature. In the transient from the thawed to the frozen condition, the indicated temperature may be as much as 300°F below the freezing point of the salt before the valve is frozen. The thermocouple signals are transmitted to the electronic switches, which provide on-off control action about a predetermined set point. If the set point is 750°F, the fast-freeze air will reduce the pipe surface temperature to this point rapidly, and the control circuit will falsely indicate that the valve is frozen. Insulation and air shields were applied to the thermocouples to obtain a better indication of the salt temperature, and further tests are underway.

The Vard Corporation of Pasadena, California was given a contract to design and build a prototype rod drive mechanism and to fabricate additional drives after approval of the prototype. Completion of the prototype is scheduled for May 1963.

A diagram of the drive is shown in Fig. 4. The diagram does not show the limit switches and shock absorbers. A continuously running fan will be provided to cool the motor, but its use is to be avoided if possible. The motor, tachometer, and gear reducer No. 1 may be incorporated into a single integrated assembly.

The potentiometer provides the independent rod position information required by the safety specification that the rods be withdrawn a minimum amount during reactor filling. The overrunning clutch provides an alternative drive path in the rod insert direction only and can be used to assist gravity if the rod or its associated chain and sprockets stick when called on to scram. Preliminary tests by the Vard Corporation indicate that dynamic braking of the motor may be a satisfactory substitute for the electromechanical brake shown on 4. This would permit the elimination of one in-cell component, along with its associated wiring and space requirements.

The control rod, which must be flexible to travel through the offsets necessitated by the crowded conditions at the top of the reactor, is being developed at ORNL. Two types of flexible metal hose have been tested: a helically wound hose with two 1/8-inch braided restraining cables, and a convoluted metal hose with a single wire-mesh sheath. Each hose was 14 ft long from the drive chain connector to the bottom of the poison elements, and it was tested in a 2-inch test thimble which was maintained at 1000 to 1300°F during the tests. Two reactor-quality stainless steel poison elements (Gdz05-A1,05) were included in the assembly, which was operated through 5000 full cycles of 60-inch stroke and 1500 scrams with accelerations near 16 ft/sec. The poison elements were removed periodically for examination. The results of the examination are discussed in Chapter 4.

Both types of flexible hoses ran freely in the two offsets and thimble. The maximum acceleration of the rods in the scram operation was approximately 16 ft/sec. There was considerable backlash due to inherent backlash and stretching of the metal hose at temperature.

The lower 16-inch radius bend of the thimble, with the mesh-covered convoluted metal hose in position, is shown in Fig. 6. Rollers were installed in the thimble at this point and on the inside of the upper bend to reduce the friction and abrasion of the thimble walls, which had.

The elements are clipped to the inner surface for easy removal. The heat characteristics of the units were studied in tests conducted with the units mounted as they would normally be positioned on the 5-in. pipe, as presented in Fig. 8. One unit, which has not been.

The formed heating element, disturbed while hot or exposed to high thermal stresses, has operated. It is in excellent condition, with only minor blistering of the silver plating on the unheated base section. The silver oxidized uniformly and presented a white crystalline surface throughout. The heating elements, which are totally embedded in ceramic.

The other unit operated 1260 hours before failure. This heater was frequently moved and opened for inspection while hot, and it was also used as an oven to burn out insulation that contained organic material. Failure occurred when the lead wires shorted to ground at the lead-wire exit.

Silver under the heating elements was in good condition. There was severe oxidation of the heater retaining clips and lower inside edges of the removable section below the plating. Along the latter edge, there were several points of complete penetration of the first lamination.

The failure occurred within a 48-hour period after the unit had been used as an oven to burn out organic material from another type of insulating material. The period of burnout was accompanied by off-gassing and visible smoke, some of which plated out on the end closures. The degeneration of the silver finish and the porcelain lead wire beading might have been caused by the sulfur. Breakdown of the insulators where the lead wires leave the unit could have caused a ground. All materials for use in the reactor are consequently being checked to eliminate those with volatile binding constituents.

The unit was opened frequently at one end while being operated at temperatures above 1000°F. The low heat capacity of the reflective sheets could have caused high thermal stresses when the heated unit was opened to the atmosphere, with resultant blistering of the silver plating. Such opening of the unit would not occur during the reactor system.

The prototype cooling bayonets for removing afterheat from the drain tanks were thermally shock-tested a total of 2257 times without failure. Ten prototype wall-mounted thermocouples were installed in the test facility, and four of these failed after 1689 cycles. Three of the thermocouples which failed were the 1/8-in. OD, sheathed, duplex type and were located at the high-stress area at the bottom of the 1-in. bayonet. The number of cycles completed before failure was a big improvement over the performance in previous tests. There is a 1/16-in. OD thermocouple of the same type in the same location which has not failed.

There are four position switches on the motor. The cable, its spring-loaded storage drum, and drive gear were purchased as a unit from Teleflex, Inc. Two synchro transmitters geared directly to the drive-gear shaft supply signals to the position indicator. One transmitter is geared so that one revolution of the shaft represents 1 ft of cable passing.

Prior to installation of the wiring, the cable drive mechanism is located in the upper box. The electrical connections for the motor, position indicator, and position switches will be brought out through and hermetically sealed in the three tubes located on the top of the box.

Two sets of integral dual-sealed ring-joint flange disconnects that are planned for use in the line which connects the pump bowl and the sampler were tested. The flanges were machined individually using gauges and procedures to make them interchangeable. The first set did not fit properly and failed to seal. A helium leak rate of less than 10^-6 cm^3 (STP)/sec was obtained with a second set of flanges that had been fully annealed and remachined. Further testing is in progress.

Operation of the full-scale MSRE core model with water at 85°F was continued to make measurements of the internal flow distribution and the pressure drop through the core. The distribution of flow through the moderator assembly is shown in Figure 13. The flow was measured in 77 more or less randomly chosen fuel channels. There are two regimes of flow distribution which represent fuel channels that are mutually perpendicular to each other. The two regimes are characterized by different inlet conditions. A plan view of a section of the 1-inch-thick bars of the core-support lattice with the fuel channel orientation superimposed is also shown in Figure 13 to illustrate the different inlet conditions.

The flow, which must pass through the small square orifice formed by the plane of contact of the two layers of support lattice, diverges into the channels between the bars of the upper layer. From there, part of the flow continues up into the fuel channels directly above, while the rest of the flow must undergo a change in direction before entering the perpendicular fuel channels. The effect of this change of direction is to reduce the flow to those channels. This reduction in flow will be eliminated by drilling holes in the lattice bars directly under them.

It is also shown in 0. 13 that the flow rate decreased slightly with radial distance from the center of the vessel. This is because of the radial pressure gradients in the vessel heads, particularly the lower head. Since the flow rate is lowest where the power density is lowest, this radial variation has the beneficial effect of making the temperature rise of the fuel more uniform. The scatter of the data is primarily due to the buildup of tolerances in the assembly of the core-support lattice.

With the summation of several tolerances, since the pressure drop through these orifices is high compared with that through the moderator, the orifices are important in controlling the flow distribution, even though cross-flow channels are provided in the core blocks. This scatter will be much less in the reactor because closer tolerances will be used than were used in fabricating the model and also because many of these clearances decrease as the reactor heats up to operating temperature.

Operating salt in the drain tank with HF and H₂S to remove oxygen. After 1540 hours of continuous operation, the loop was shut down (in October 1962), and samples of graphite were removed via a dry box for metallurgical examination. Additional information was obtained on the operational characteristics of the graphite container access joint and on the formation of solids at the salt liquid level. Details of these tests are presented in the following sections.

In order to determine the effect of this treatment, the as-received sample ETL-1 and a sample (ETL-2) removed from the loop after this treatment were degassed at elevated temperatures, and the evolved gas was analyzed. The results of the gas analyses are presented in Table 2. 2.

Pretreated salt was circulated through the pretreated graphite at 1200°F with a velocity of 1 1/2 to 1 3/4 ft/sec in the flow channels. The loop was filled initially to the minimum operating level of the DANA pump to provide a minimum salt-to-graphite ratio and a maximum resolution of the effect of the graphite on the salt samples. The pressure on the graphite during operation was 11 to 12 psig at the inlet and 8 to 9 psig at the outlet. In October, after 1540 hr of operation at the above conditions, the loop was shut down for removal of samples.

The loop with salt prior to operation during the current period, too much of the trapped gas in the joint was bled off, and the liquid level rose higher than intended. After the frozen salt cake was established, as indicated in Fig. 15; the heat removed by the cooling air required to maintain the frozen zone was excessive, and the loop temperatures could not be maintained at 1200°F with the installed heater capacity. The heat transfer in the liquid salt portion of this joint was much greater than could be accounted for by conductance alone and was possibly due to some small flow in the annular region below the frozen zone. By increasing the gas pressure in the region above the frozen zone, it was possible to lower the liquid level to the location shown in Fig. 15 and thus leave the ring of frozen salt at the upper location, thereby arranging to take the large temperature drop in the gas space.

The material was porous to gas pressure from the dry side, while an increase in pressure from the liquid side tended to seal the pores with liquid. The gas trapped above the liquid level maintained the level in the position shown in Figure 15 during 1500 hours of operation without further attention. Although cooling airflow was maintained to ensure sealing of the joint during operation, the salt-to-gas interface temperature remained above the temperature of the molten salt. The presence of the liquid-to-gas interface during operation was also indicated by a constant differential between the joint pressure and the changing pump bowl gas pressure.

Indications are that a similar type of joint could be operated in the MSRE. The frozen-zone backup plug would protect against level fluctuations resulting from pressure transients in the reactor. In particular, it would protect against the effect reported previously of the salt rising in only one sector of the annulus as the liquid began to freeze in the other sectors.

The method of establishing the joint in the reactor would be to have a low fill pressure in the reactor before the salt started in, and then to raise the salt to the level desired for the frozen-salt backup ring. After freezing the ring, the level would be allowed to drop to below the bottom of the joint, and the pump bowl pressure would be increased. The salt level would then be raised to trap the required amount of gas and thus obtain the proper liquid level for the designed operating conditions. Some small manipulation of this final level would be possible by regulating the gas pressure in the salt pump bowl.

Twelve small cylindrical graphite samples, two graphite prototype core elements (2 x 2 x 50 in. ), and three metal specimens were removed for metallurgical examination. A description of the problems encountered in the sampling operation is given below.

The dry-box facility, which enabled samples to be removed and replaced in the loop without admitting atmospheric contamination, was prepared and attached to the graphite access joint after shutdown of the loop. The small samples were easily removed and isolated in carriers, but the graphite prototype core elements appeared to be stuck and could not be removed with the equipment available in the dry box. A 200-lb spring scale had been included for measurement of the lifting force required, but it was inadequate. Removal of the two elements was finally accomplished by rapidly heating the graphite container to 500°F, thereby expanding the container and loosening the elements. The lifting force used was probably between the 200-lb limit of the scale and the 500-lb rating of the hoist.

The appearance of these globules; it is not believed that these were the major cause of the removal difficulty. The original installation of these elements was difficult because irregularities in the rolled and seam-welded container made the fit very tight. The new elements were machined to a slightly smaller size and were placed in position without difficulty.

The two elements removed had been inspected prior to testing and designated Class I and Class IV, respectively. Class I denotes the best, and Class IV the worst with respect to surface faults of all the elements of the graphite obtained for the ETL experiments. When weighed upon removal from the dry box, both elements had net weight gains of 7 g. Most of this gain, however, was from salt that had entered the threaded opening made for the INOR-8 lifting attachment. When this salt was removed and weighed separately, the net increases in weight were 0.86 g and a 0.5% net increase after operation with 150-psig pressure.

When the core plug of the graphite container access joint was removed for graphite sampling, a ridge approximately 1/32 in. thick of metallic-appearing material was found at the position of the former liquid level. Most of the joint that was below the liquid level was covered with a very thin dark coating down to the salt outlet of the container. A chemical analysis of the sample indicated 7-55 wt% Fe, 2. 34 wt% Cr, and 52. 5 wt% Zr. Salt samples from the loop contained only 0.13 wt% Zr. Indications were that the zirconium was in the form of oxide since an HF acid solution was required to dissolve the sample rather than the usual nitric and sulfuric acid solutions used for the fluoride. The collection of corrosion products and zirconium oxide was apparently caused by the cold-trapping effect of the temperature gradient in this area and the very low salt velocity just below this area. Additional tests will be conducted to determine the characteristics of this cold-trapping effect.

The fresh salt used during the operation of the ETL with graphite installed was treated with HCl and HF for two periods of 48 and 52 hours during November and December to remove oxygen. In each case, the treatment was carried out at 1500 hours of operation with the graphite installed, averaging 300 ppm in the loop and 200 ppm in the drain tank, for an average of 236 ppm in the total inventory.

The product removal rates of three treatment periods during August, November, and December have a similarity in form, which suggests a method of determining not only the total oxide content but also the quantities present in different forms, such as soluble ZrOs and precipitated ZrOs. The results of the November treatment (following graphite operation) shown in Fig. 16 indicate two phases of oxide removal.

16 are based on data collected from the first cold trap at 32°F, since rates could not be determined from the final trap at -109°F. If, however, the total collection rate could be determined, integration of the individual slope equations would yield amounts of individual phases. Additional data will be obtained by adding oxide to the tank and measuring the rate at which it is removed by the HF treatment.

Samples of the ETL graphite were tested for permeability at room temperature. The permeability tests were performed on prototype sections by measuring gas flow from the flow channel surface to a 1/8-inch hole drilled at the axial centerline of the element. For this configuration, which has an area-to-length ratio ranging between 69 and 99 cm, helium permeability from 1 x 10^-3 to 3 x 10^-3 cm²/sec was measured on.

A series of experiments is being planned to obtain a better understanding of the mechanism controlling the distribution of xenon in the MSRE. Preliminary studies in support of these experiments have shown that the gaseous fission products tend to be transported into the graphite or removed at the pump bowl. The studies have also shown that, within the range of knowledge of the critical parameters, this division is strongly dependent on the core flow characteristic, as well as the diffusivity of the graphite and the removal rate at the pump bowl. Presently, experiments are being planned to determine the xenon diffusion coefficient for reactor-grade graphite, to determine the removal rate in the pump bowl, and to determine the overall xenon mass transfer coefficient.

A procedure was prepared for the remote replacement of a freeze-flange gasket. This task requires most of the anticipated in-cell manipulation of the flanges. Eighty-eight steps are involved that include assembling the clamp onto the flange (see step 17), stowing the clamp on in-cell brackets, spreading the flanges apart with the pipeline jack system, overcoming misalignment, and handling the flange covers and the ring gasket. This procedure was demonstrated in the maintenance mockup while observing as many of the reactor restrictions and limitations as possible. The tools, handled with a jib crane and a special A-frame, were operated through a wooden mockup of the portable maintenance shield and were observed remotely with a sheathed periscope. The complete task required two men.

These tools and techniques are applicable to all freeze flanges in the system, with the exception of FF-100 (between the reactor and the pump) where interferences with a pump support beam and line 101 hinder the placement and operation of the presently designed tools. For this case, a special offset clamp operator tool, which is the tool most affected by the interferences, was designed and is being fabricated. Also, the mockup is being completed in this area so that the new tool and all others may be.

A 1/6-scale model of the reactor cell was constructed (Figs. 2. 18 and 2. 19) to assist in evaluating maintenance problem areas both during design and later during maintenance periods. The model is complete with respect to the components that will be removed during maintenance. It is dimensionally accurate and can be disassembled in the same fashion as the reactor system. Color coding has been used to distinguish the fuel salt, coolant salt, air, oil, helium, and water lines.

1200 rpm and 1200 gpm. Operation was interrupted by a short that developed in the stator winding of the alternator of the drive motor power supply, but testing was resumed with the pump drive motor directly connected to 60-cycle electric power.

Test Operation With Water. During further water tests of the fuel pump, measurements were taken of the impeller loading over a range of head and flow at three speeds. The results of the measurements are presented in Figure 20 and compared with data supplied by the designer.

The impeller and volute hydraulic configurations. The ORNL experimental results indicate that the impeller loads at low pump capacity are as much as a factor of 3 lower than those predicted, and thus bearing life should be greater than previously anticipated.

The PKP test pump continued to operate. It has accumulated a total of LiF-BeF2-ThF2-UF4 (65-30-4-1 mole %). Leakage across the upper seal has continued to be approximately 10 cm3/day, and the leakage across the lower seal has recently averaged 2.5 cm3/day, which is considered to be small.

Attempts to increase the signal-to-noise ratio were made, with limited success. This ratio is already high enough, better than 3 to 1, for dependable operation, but a method of reducing the noise level would be desirable. To date, the instrument has operated successfully with an excitation current as high as 20 amps at 1 kHz and as low as 0.1 amp at 1 kHz. The very low current excitation was obtained from the oscillator of a Foxboro Dynalog, with the Dynalog being used both as an excitation source and an indicator-recorder. This was considered to be one of the most successful test runs made because it indicated positively that no special instrument systems were needed to use this single-point liquid-level indicator.

During this reporting period, the probe connectors to be used in the MSRE system were also tested. These connectors, which are 12-pin units of the type used for thermocouples, operated satisfactorily and gave no indication of failure or introduction of noise into the system. Some intermittent difficulties that started when these connectors were first installed were found to be caused by poor contacts at compression connectors elsewhere in the circuits. Fabrication drawings of the units to be installed in the MSRE drain tanks were completed.

Developmental testing of continuous liquid-level-indicating elements for use in measurements of molten-salt levels in the MSRE fuel and coolant pump bowls was continued. During the year, they were operated at temperatures between 900 and 1300°F, with no objectionable operational characteristics being observed. For approximately 11 months of this period, the system operated at 1250°F. In addition to the planned temperature cycles previously reported, power was off twice for modifying electric wiring in the building. There were no changes in the characteristics of the two systems as a result of the temperature cycling associated with these power failures.

It is still not known whether there has been salt-vapor deposition on metal surfaces above the liquid-salt level. One adjustable spark plug probe is locked in place by solid material, but there has been no indication that the level indicator system, with the core tube above the liquid salt, has any salt deposit on the core or in the tube. It was assumed when this system was designed that only a small amount of solids deposited on the core tube or in the core tube container would lock the core tube in place or restrict its movement. There is no indication that this has taken.

A simplified diagram of the bubbler system is shown in Fig. 22. The basic operation of the system is the same as that of conventional dip-tube bubbler systems in that the level signal is obtained by measuring the differential between the pressure in the gas space above the molten salt and the pressure inside the dip tube. When the tube is purged with a small gas flow and the salt density is maintained constant, the differential pressure produced is proportional to the height of salt above the bottom of the dip.

The MSRE installation presented special problems not found in a conventional installation because (1) the bubbler system piping communicates with the primary system and forms a possible escape path for radioactive gases, and (2) the system could fail if pressure transients in the reactor pump bowl forced molten salt into the cold purge piping external to the pump bowl. In the present system design, containment of radioactive materials is effected by placing double-check valves in each purge line and by enclosing the check valves and all lines and equipment downstream.

Of the check valves in a secondary containment vessel, plugging of the purge lines with salt during pressure transients is prevented by maintaining the volume of the purge lines downstream of the check valves as small as is permitted by pressure-drop considerations and by installing a surge pot having a volume ten times that of the purge lines in the heated zone adjacent to the dip tube. The present system is designed to withstand a 60-psi pressure increase from 6 psia without plugging the purge lines.

Capillary restrictors located upstream of the check valves serve a double purpose of providing a means of flow measurement and of preventing back diffusion of radioactive gas into operating areas. The purge rate is controlled by throttling valves. Deviation of the purge rate from the design value is detected by pressure switches installed upstream and between the capillaries. Solenoid valves installed downstream of the capillaries provide a means of checking the zero calibration of the differential pressure transmitter. The solenoid valves may also be used to block the lines on a signal from the safety control circuitry.

A mockup of the bubbler-type system was installed on the prototype pump and was in operation for approximately two months during this reporting period. The system was then temporarily modified so that the bubbler penetrations could be used for back-diffusion studies with krypton. During the period that it was in use, the bubbler system operated satisfactorily. One mishap occurred when an improperly installed fitting leaked and allowed the pressure in a bubbler line to become less than the pump-bowl pressure. Molten salt was forced into one of the dip tubes and associated gas lines, and it completely blocked them. This situation could not be corrected, so both differential-pressure transmitters were connected to the other dip tube and were operated this way until the systems were shut down. Since much higher quality construction will be used in the MSRE, the probability of a similar failure occurring in the reactor installation is very small.

Two types of dip tubes were tested, but there were no observable differences in their operating characteristics. One was open-ended, with a small V-notch cut in the side; the other had a closed end with a 1/8-inch hole through the side of the tube just above the bottom closure.

Development testing of the temperature scanner system installed on the liquid level test facility continued. A test was started on August 6, 1962, and the scanner operated satisfactorily until December 3, 1962. This was approximately 3000 hours of continuous operation. On December 3, it was noted that the system was generating excessive noise pulses. The input thermocouples were checked and found to be the cause of some of the noise. The rest of the noise apparently was being generated by the switch. The noise became worse with time, and the system was shut down on December 15.

The lower deck bearing was also found to be bad. Mercury had leaked through the bearing and onto the top of the motor. The switch was thoroughly cleaned; the lower bearing was replaced, and the switch was then reassembled. The nitrogen purge system was modified to ensure equal nitrogen flow through each deck of the switch.

The scanner was placed back in operation on December 28, 1962. On January 7, 1963, the switch was again stopped because of excessive audible noise. Examination of the switch showed that the top bearing had failed. The switch was again cleaned and reassembled. Operation started again on January 8, and the switch has operated satisfactorily with little noise since that time. It is planned to continue the test to determine switch operating life and to obtain data for determining more closely the oscilloscope, amplifier, and discriminator stability, and the precision and accuracy of the total system.

A high-temperature differential pressure transmitter to be used in measuring molten salt flow in the MSRE coolant system was ordered from Taylor Instrument Company, the only bidder on requests sent out in May 1962. After some clarification and a few changes in specifications, which reduced the cost of each transmitter to one-third of the original proposal, the purchase order was placed in December. Delivery is expected in June.

The transmitter is a modified version of Taylor's standard instrument Model 225T. The two major changes required were that the pressure-sensing head be made of INOR-8 and that the standard pneumatic output system be replaced by an electrical strain gauge.

Three transmitters were ordered and will be tested at ORNL prior to installation on the reactor. It is expected that ORNL's participation in the development of this transmitter will be limited to reviewing the design prior to fabrication, INOR-8 welding and inspection, and testing and evaluating the completed transmitters.

Radiator Thermocouple Test. It was determined from tests that Thermon X63, a heat-conducting cement, is not suitable for use with radiator tube thermocouples because of its corrosive effect on INOR-8. A typical radiator tube thermocouple attachment was coated with this cement and heated to 1250°F for a period of five weeks. Metallographic examination revealed corrosion to a depth of 1 mil on the surface of the INOR-8 tube in contact with the Thermon X63 cement. Thermon will not be used on the MSRE radiator thermocouples, and the reduced accuracy will be accepted.

MSRE prototype surface-mounted thermocouples were installed on the pump test loop to determine how accurately thermocouples located on the walls of pipes adjacent to heaters would measure the temperature of the molten salt inside the pipe. Data obtained from these tests indicated that the temperature readings of the surface-mounted thermocouples were influenced by the heaters to such an extent that the thermocouples could not be used for computation of reactor heat power or for precise measurement of the mean reactor temperature unless the heater power was maintained constant and a correction was made for the bias in the thermocouple reading.

Thermocouple End Seals. Several sealing and potting compounds were tested for use in sealing the ends of mineral-insulated thermocouples and copper-tube-sheathed thermocouple extension cables terminating in disconnects located inside the reactor and drain tank cells and junction boxes located near penetrations outside the cells. Ceramic-based compounds were tested for use inside the cells, and epoxy compounds were tested for use outside the cells. Test seals were made with the following compounds: Araldite epoxy compound, Ames Technical G copper oxide cement, Sauereisen No. 30 ceramic-based cement, and Thermostix ceramic-based cement. Several of the ceramic-based compounds required curing temperatures too high for use with copper. Preference was given to cements that cured and set at room temperatures.

Several test seals were made with Araldite in which no leaks were detected with 60-psig helium applied from the inside. The insulation was removed from the wires in the other test seals made with Araldite.

Glass-to-metal multi-terminal header seals were also tested for use in sealing the ends of the copper-tube-sheathed thermocouple extension cables terminating in disconnects located inside the cell. Test seals of this type were pressurized to 60 psig helium, and no leaks were detected.

This method of sealing the ends of the thermocouple extension cables appears promising. The glass-to-metal header seals under test were supplied by the Hermetic Seal Corporation. Further tests will be conducted with this type of end seal, including irradiation of typical assemblies to determine susceptibility to radiation damage.

Formula 0900 glaze compound, manufactured by the Physical Science Corporation, was tested for use in sealing the ends of individual metal-sheathed thermocouples terminating in disconnects located inside the cells. This material is a water-mix glaze compound that is completely nonhygroscopic when cured at 1550°F for a period of 15 min. The suitability of this material for the application has not yet been determined. The material adheres well to metals, but it is rather brittle when cured.

The design work on the Molten-Salt Reactor Experiment is nearly completed, except for the instrumentation and controls. During this reporting period, the design of the fixture for the assembly of the drain tanks and the flush tank was completed, and the designs of the electrical distribution system for the heater network, the conduit, and cable tray layouts, and the modifications to the existing auxiliary diesel power system were more than 90% completed. There were no changes in design concept or significant changes in detail of any component.

Based on test evaluations of two different types of insulation, specifications for the design, construction, and testing of all-metal reflective-type removable insulation with integral ceramic heaters were prepared for bid invitations. This insulation will be applied to salt-containing pipes.

The layout of the instrumentation and controls remains essentially the same as described in the previous reports. Three instrument panels, all located in the high-bay area, were added. Two of these panels will serve the fuel salt chemical processing system, and the third is panel No. 2 of the containment air system. Locations of the wireways between panels and field-mounted equipment, signal-cable routing, and locations of terminal boxes in the vicinity of the reactor and drain tank cells were determined. Locations of thermocouple and instrument disconnects within the reactor and drain tank cells are now considered to be firm. Assignment of containment vessel penetration locations for instrument lines and cables is essentially complete.

Flow Diagrams: Instrument application flow diagrams for the instrument air distribution system, fuel salt chemical processing system, and the fuel loading and storage system were completed. Eleven diagrams previously approved are now being revised in accordance with recent design changes.

Control Circuitry. Criteria for control and safety circuitry are being reviewed, and preliminary block diagrams of the circuits are to be modified, as necessary, to incorporate recommendations resulting from the review. Detailed designs of circuits that are obviously consistent with recommended practices were started, and two schematic drawings of the annunciator circuits for the main and auxiliary control boards were completed. The designs of the 48-volt DC power system for the safety control circuit and the remote control circuitry for switchgear and motor control centers were approved for construction.

Fabrication was completed of the eight modular instrument panel sections required for the main control board. The three remaining main control board panels, as well as the control console, were partially designed and fabricated and will be completed when nuclear instrument and control circuit requirements are known. A complete design for one panel section includes front panel layout drawings, instrument mounting hole cutout drawings, pneumatic tubing diagrams, and electrical wiring diagrams.

Design drawings for three auxiliary instrument panels for temperature alarm switches were completed. Designs of the six nuclear instrument panels to be located in the auxiliary control room are 30% and 60% complete, respectively. Fabrication of the process instrument panels is 35% complete. The thermocouple cabinet design was revised to increase the number of patch plugs.

The designs of the control panel for the sump level indicator and the two instrument racks, one supporting the solenoid valves and the electric signal transmitter power supplies, and the other supporting the electric transmitter signal amplifiers, were completed. These panels are to be located in the transmitter room. The designs of panels and racks to be located in this area are now complete, and fabrication is underway.

Installation design details for cell penetration safety block valves and for field-mounted instruments on the containment air system and the oil systems for the fuel and coolant salt pumps were completed. Fabrication drawings for four salt-level-indicator probes on the drain tank were completed.

Process and Personnel Radiation Monitors. Requirements for process radiation monitors were reviewed and revised to incorporate changes required by system revisions. At present, there are 23 monitors located at 12 stations. Where the monitors perform an alarm function only, a single channel is provided. Monitors that are interlocked in the reactor safety system are duplicated or triplicated, with their contacts arranged in 1 out of 2 or 2 out of 3 coincidence. The selection of detectors and associated electronic equipment was completed for all approved monitor applications. In general, ORNL Q-1916 count-rate meters with GM tube detectors are specified for low radiation level applications, and ion chambers and electrometers are specified for high radiation level applications. Provisions are being made to permit remote testing of some of the process monitor channels. Detailed design of field-installation hardware, wiring, and shielding is underway. Panel installation design is nearing completion.

Personnel monitoring instrument requirements remain as previously reported. Individual instrument locations were specified; requirements of power and alarm circuitry were determined, and the designs of power and signal junction boxes were completed. Several prototype alarm modules for the master alarm panel were fabricated and tested. Panel installation design is underway.

Thermocouples: Five drawings showing the thermocouple locations and attachment details for the fuel and coolant salt circulating systems, flush and drain system, and the coolant salt radiator tubes were completed. A list giving all thermocouples in the reactor system and the proposed method of readout was prepared. There are presently 819 thermocouples. Of these, 169 will be connected to the data logger, 365 will be connected to temperature scanners, 42 will be connected to a precision temperature indicator, 42 will be connected to multipoint recorders, 78 are permanently assigned.

Designs of attachments and methods of installation of the 120 thermocouples on the radiator tubes were completed, and the thermocouples and attachment devices were fabricated.

Pump bowl (3): determining reactor draining and filling characteristics for normal and abnormal conditions; and (4) finding optimum control parameters for the pump bowl pressure control system. It was found that passing helium at 1200°F through the drain tank vent valves during normal venting of a pressurized tank would not cause excessive valve temperatures. The valve plug and body temperatures would not exceed 500 and 250°F, respectively.

Pressure surges in the pump bowl are undesirable because they could damage the pump bowl oil seal, tend to reverse the direction of purge gas flow, and tend to back salt up into the level detector dip tube, which could cause an erroneous low salt level indication. A probable worst-case incident for pressurizing the pump bowl was assumed in which immediately after the reactor had been filled and the freeze valve frozen.

A dump demand occurred. The vent valve on the pressurized drain tank failed to open. The drain tank pressure was relieved through the bypass valve into the pump bowl, and the pump bowl pressure increased. In order to prevent an excessive pressure transient in this incident, flow restrictions were added to the model.

A preliminary investigation of the pump bowl pressure controller indicated that the small purge flow rates and the large volumes would make the control quite sluggish. The control should, however, be satisfactory for long-term steady operation. Approximate optimum controller settings are to be determined from further simulation work.

The Kaminer Construction Corporation completed the major modifications to Building 7503. These modifications consisted of a 7-ft extension to the reactor containment cell, with the necessary penetrations and nuclear radiation shielding; the construction of a drain tank cell of magnetite concrete lined with stainless steel; the installation of building exhaust ducting; modifications to the radiator ducting; construction of a containment enclosure inside the high bay area; installation of miscellaneous electrical, water, and compressed air lines and equipment; and the construction of a remote-maintenance control room.

The R. S. Hixson Company completed the major modifications outside of Building 7503. They consisted of the erection of a 100-ft steel stack, with associated blowers and ducting; the construction of a filter house for ventilating air supplied to the building and a filter pit for exhaust air; and the installation of a cooling tower.

The machine shop at the Y-12 plant of UCNC has the prime responsibility for fabricating the major reactor components consisting of the reactor, primary heat exchanger, radiator, and enclosure; salt storage tanks; and salt pumps. These components are all being made of INOR-8.

Reactor Vessel and Control Rod Thimble Assembly. Fabrication of the support grid for the graphite moderator was completed. The reactor vessel and the control rod thimble assembly are approximately 80% complete. A contract was awarded to the Westinghouse Electric Corporation for the fabrication of the control elements, which are to be hollow cylinders made of a mixture of gadolinium and aluminum oxides and canned in stainless steel.

Moderator Graphite. The vendor has not yet been able to manufacture graphite to meet all the requirements of the specifications. Approximately 1000 out of the 1200 pieces needed have been formed, baked, and graphitized, but most of the pieces have small cracks in excess of specifications and are being evaluated for possible use. The vendor is attempting to manufacture the remaining pieces to specification. The graphite was originally scheduled for delivery in September 1962 but will not be available until after July 1963.

Thermal Shield. The 35-ton stainless steel thermal shield for the reactor vessel was completed by the UCNC Paducah Machine Shop and delivered to the reactor site. The approximately 70 tons of steel balls that will be poured into the thermal shield for gamma-ray attenuation were also received.

A mockup of the tube bundle with 9 full-scale tubes and a partially machined full-size tube sheet was assembled prior to fabricating the unit for the heat exchanger. Problems associated with forming, fitting, welding, and back-brazing the tubes into the tube sheet were solved on the mockup, and methods were developed for visual and radiographic inspection of the welds and for ultrasonic inspection of the brazed joints. Techniques were also developed for handling, positioning, and shipping the unit to the Wall Colmonoy plant in Detroit for brazing in a hydrogen atmosphere.

Radiator and Radiator Enclosure. The salt-to-air radiator is approximately 80% complete. The ten banks of 12 tubes each were completed. The tube banks are being assembled to the main headers, and thermocouples are being installed on the tubes. The venturi and 5-in. pipe subassemblies for attachment to the radiator inlet were fabricated, and the venturi was calibrated. This venturi will assure flow in the coolant piping system.

Salt Storage Tanks. The fuel salt flush tank, the coolant salt storage tank, and the two steam domes and bayonet assemblies for cooling the two fuel salt storage tanks were completed. The tanks were pressure-tested, and mass spectrometer helium leak testing is.

Fabrication of the two fuel salt storage tanks is approximately 85%. The remaining work consists of welding the shell and lower head in position on both tanks.

Procurement was initiated for most of the wiring, heaters, junction boxes, cable trays, etc. , and delivery was made on all items, except special units for heating the salt piping and heat exchanger in the reactor and drain tank cells. A contract is presently being negotiated for the fabrication of these heaters. Procurement is approximately 15% complete on electrical material for miscellaneous electrical work outside the cells.

Remote Maintenance Equipment. A jig for use in assembling the heat exchanger, fuel pump, reactor, and all associated piping in the reactor cell was completed, as well as a jig for attaching piping to the fuel drain tanks. The pipe alignment brackets for freeze flanges were partially fabricated. The arrangements were completed for the purchase of three specially designed tongs to lift the shielding plugs and special optical tooling equipment.

Fuel Salt Sampler and Enricher. The transfer tube and positioning jig assembly is approximately 90% complete, and miscellaneous tools were completed. Several special bellows assemblies, miscellaneous stainless steel stock, and cable drive units were procured. Powell Valve Company is manufacturing special motorized valves. Fabrication of the main unit of the sampler-enricher, which will be located on the ground floor, has not been started.

Stainless Steel Pipe and Fittings. Approximately 85% of all stainless steel pipe, tubing, valves, and fittings are on hand. Most of the pipe, tubing, and fittings were purchased in accordance with ORNL specifications that require more rigid inspection than is required by ASTM specifications. These specifications included liquid penetrant and ultrasonic inspections that were performed at the various vendors' plants. Numerous special adapters and disconnects were fabricated in UCNC shops.

Reactor Auxiliary Systems. Special equipment was fabricated that included helium dryers for the cover gas system, oil catch tanks, air and helium penetration plugs for the drain tank cell, the penetration plug for the sampler-enricher, the blower and filter frame, and freeze valve cooling air nozzles. Three stainless steel heat exchangers, activated charcoal for the charcoal beds, two 75-hp motors and blowers for component air cooling, two stainless steel feedwater tanks, and two component air cooling vessels built to Boiler Code specifications were obtained from vendors. The Young Radiator Company is fabricating three space coolers for cooling the cell air.

Instruments. Approximately 907 of the commercially available standard components required for the process instruments were received, as well as some components that required special development or procurement effort. The special components include the drain tank weigh system, the venturi flow element for the coolant system, thermocouple wire and extension cable, and the thermocouple disconnects. Vendor fabrication drawings were reviewed and approved for weld-sealed transmitters, valves for radioactive helium gas service, and helium flow elements. Purchase orders were placed for an addition to the thermocouple patch panel and for a high-temperature NaK-filled differential pressure transmitter.

A proposal for the acquisition of a data system was prepared. This proposal recommended that a specific data-handling system, selected on the basis of preliminary proposals, be acquired. The recommended method of acquisition was to lease the system for one year and then to purchase it.

An order for freeze flange and freeze valve temperature alarm switches was placed with the Electra Systems Corporation. The equipment is to be shipped in February 1963. The selection of the Electra switches was based on the low bid and the satisfactory operation of test units on a freeze valve test facility.

A new estimate was made of the cost of the Molten-Salt Reactor Experiment, and the total cost for engineering, inspection, procurement, construction, and installation of the reactor increased from $7,092,000. The new estimate is compared with the present working estimate in Table 3. 1.

A full-scale tube bundle was fabricated to test welding and brazing procedures. This assembly, which simulated closely the mass and actual design of the tube bundle for the MSRE heat exchanger, constituted a final proof test of the fabrication procedures. The sample was assembled, welded, shipped, and brazed in the manner prescribed for the actual unit.

The sample tube bundle is shown in Figure 1 in the welding fixture. Several full-length U-tubes were included to determine whether unsupported tubes would distort and oxidize during brazing. The full bundle of tubes, of which 52 were welded and back-brazed, was used at the tube sheet to obtain gas and heat baffling effects that might influence the quality of the braze. Stainless steel tubes were tack-welded in the remaining holes. The welds were made semi-automatically using the prescribed conditions, and no difficulties were encountered. Visual and radiographic inspection indicated that all the welds were sound.

During the heating cycle of the brazing operation, a temperature difference of approximately 400°F was observed between the tube sheet and the extreme end of the U-tubes, and there was a difference of 150°F between the center and the perimeter of the tube sheet. The planned holding period at 1650°F reduced these differences to less than 100°F. However, at the brazing temperature, all thermocouples read well within the specified 1835 to 1885°F range.

After brazing, visual inspection of the sample heat exchanger showed that all INOR-8 components were bright, and all brazed joints had good fillets. No distortion or tube sagging was evident. Ultrasonic inspection revealed all joints to be completely brazed and to have only minor, scattered porosity. This was later confirmed by metallographic examination of selected brazes. A typical tube-to-tube sheet weld and back braze is shown in Fig. 2. This photomicrograph illustrates the uniform weld contour obtained and the flow of brazing alloy to the root of the seal welds.

Seventy-nine brazed tube-to-header joints in two different mockups of the tube bundle for the MSRE heat exchanger were inspected using the Lamb-wave technique described previously. Thirty joints were evaluated in the first mockup with the use of a 1/16-inch-diameter flat-bottom hole as a reference for calibration sensitivity.

The MSRE tube bundle will be inspected using the 3/32-inch-diameter reference hole. Scanning of the joints will be accomplished with the mechanical device described previously, which, as modified, allows automatic x-y recording of unbonded areas.

Mechanical properties are being determined on random heats of INOR-8 from which MSRE reactor components have been fabricated to evaluate the effects of large-scale production and improved quality requirements. Some tensile tests and stress-rupture tests were completed.

Material, with one specimen being cut parallel to the plate rolling direction and one normal to the rolling direction. The two heats behaved similarly, except with respect to elongation and reduction in area at high temperatures, and no variation in properties could be attributed to direction in the original plate.

The material was reported to meet specification requirements, except that there were cracks, and some bars had low bulk densities. The effects of these deviations from the specifications on mechanical properties and on salt permeation were determined, and the cracked condition was studied.

Examinations were made of two base-stock graphite parts and four bars of completely processed graphite supplied by the vendor. 66 g/cm³, which increased to 1. 82 to 1. 88 g/cm³ in the final fabrication operations. Most of the bars had bulk densities of approximately 1. 85 g/cm³. It appeared to be fine-grained graphite fabricated from at least four different sources of carbon.

Visual and radiographic techniques were used to evaluate the cracks, which tended to be near the longitudinal axes of the bars. No relationship existed between the size of the opening and the lengths of the cracks. The widths ranged from 1/8 to 1 1/4 in. and averaged 5/8 in. Most of the cracks were less than 3 in. long. It was calculated that cracks of the latter size that intersected the external surfaces of the bar would fill with molten salt at a pressure difference of 20 psi.

Fabrication information for this graphite indicated that the cracks developed during the final graphitizing operation. The base-stock graphite examined was essentially free of cracks; only two short, closed cracks were detected radiographically. A microscopic examination of completely processed graphite showed impregnating material in some of the cracks; however, and thus some cracking must have occurred at processing steps earlier than the final one. A more detailed study of this is being made.

A comparison was made of the permeation by molten salt and mercury of base-stock graphite and finished graphite under the conditions given, noting that permeation of CGB graphite by mercury or molten salt is within specification limits. It is significant to note that the 150-psig molten salt pressure used in the standard permeation screening test for graphite is approximately three times the maximum expected in the MSRE. The molten salt that permeated the graphite in the screening test was found only at the external surfaces and in the cracks. This finding indicates that the pore structure of the graphite is fine enough to prevent impregnation by the molten salt.

Thermal cycling of salt-impregnated graphite. Laboratory thermal cycling tests were run on CGB graphite with salt-impregnated cracks to determine whether damage would occur under conditions simulating the draining, cooling, and reheating of the MSRE core.

The specimen with the greatest salt permeation at each pressure was tested by thermal cycling in an argon atmosphere at a pressure that varied from 10 to 20 psig, depending on the temperature. The specimens were subjected to 100 thermal cycles in which the temperature was increased from 390 to 1300°F in the first 9 min of each cycle. After this treatment, there were no detectable changes in the appearance of the graphite or in the lengths of the cracks. Each specimen lost approximately 38 wt% of the original impregnating salt.

Additional studies will be made of the effects of thermal cycling on graphite with salt-impregnated cracks under a qualitative simulation of a hot spot in the MSRE. Specimens will be impregnated at 1300°F and then rapidly heated from 390 to 1832°F.

Tensile strengths were determined for CGB graphite in both the transverse and parallel directions by a ring technique similar to that reported by Bradstreet and his coworkers and by conventional tensile bar tests. Two sets of rings were machined, with their axes of revolution respectively perpendicular to and parallel with the extrusion direction of the graphite. There was no significant trend that could be related to the presence of cracks. The graphite was apparently not notch sensitive since stress failure cracks frequently terminated within the body of the rings.

A more comprehensive tensile test of CGB graphite was made using specimens that were not appreciably affected by the cracks and yielded an average strength of 5440 psi and a modulus of elasticity of 3. 0 x 10^6 psi. A typical fracture is shown in the figure.

The specimens that demonstrated a definite effect of internal cracks had a minimum strength of 1510 psi and an average strength of 2940 psi. These test bars all fractured in a stair-step fashion (No. 4b); and in some cases, the axial crack was longer than 1/2 in. The specimens that were greatly reduced in strength failed in a two-step process that was quite audible. Apparently, the axial crack caused one side of the specimen to fail and create the first audible snap. The specimen continued momentarily to support the load before the eccentric loading caused sufficient bending to fracture the other side and cause the second audible snap.

These data indicate that the weakest cracked bar tested met the specified tensile strength requirement of 1500 psi, and that even this bar was stronger than the commonly used nuclear-grade AGOT graphite. The CGB graphite, which was essentially free of cracks, was three to four times stronger than AGOT graphite.

Prototype control rod elements consisting of Gd2O3-Al2O3 (70-30 wt%) ceramic bodies, canned in austenitic stainless steel, were procured to determine the fabricability of the rod design. These elements underwent general inspection and testing, which included exposure in the control rod testing rig described in Chapter 2, to ascertain their soundness, dimensional stability, and overall suitability for MSRE use.

The elements were designed to fit over a flexible hose that would move through a crooked path. Difficulty in meeting dimension specifications and density requirements caused the supplier, Dresser Products, Inc. , to abandon cold-pressing methods for fabricating the ceramic pieces. The elements were produced by a hot-pressing technique, and deviations from specified dimensions.

Two canned elements were exposed to repeated thermal and mechanical shocks in the control-rod testing rig, as described in Chapter 2. They were examined radiographically and dimensionally after 2 hours (one cycle) and 1700 scrams. Holes were made in one can to expose the GdP03-AlS03 to air for the final 250 hours of the test.

Dimensions of the metal cans were not changed by the testing. Axial cracks were observed radiographically after the first cycle, and severe cracks in both the axial and transverse directions were observed at later stages. No crumbling or ratcheting was evident; however, and no condition was observed that might affect the nuclear or mechanical performance of the control rod elements.

In preliminary experiments, it was observed that a cold-pressed mechanical mixture of this composition melted when heated to 1750°C. A similar body was heated to 1650°C and became severely distorted, with the diameter at the top larger than at the bottom. In addition, the top portion was visibly porous, and the bottom portion was dense.

1650°C and was able to flow and settle in the lower regions. No evidence of liquid loss was detected on the spheroidal, high-fired GdPO3 particles (35-100 mesh) used as setter material; however, no weight change was detected after sintering.

A series of experiments was then carried out with pre-reacted powder in an attempt to overcome the problems encountered when using the rather standard fabrication procedure described above and to better understand the sintering characteristics in this system. The pre-reaction step consisted of heating a dry-blended and cold-pressed (7500 psi) mixture to 1650°C for 1/2 hr in hydrogen. The product was then ground to a -325 mesh. The weight and dimensions were determined after each stage. The results of these measurements are also given in Table 4. 6.

No densification occurred at 1450°C, and only slight shrinkage took place. The outside diameter at the bottom became 0.049 inches greater than that at the top, and a large shrinkage crack developed near the bottom. The large densification was evidently associated with the presence of a liquid phase, and the distortion and cracking were the result of frictional restraint between the bottom of the specimen and the particles of Gd2O3 setter material.

The specimen was inverted at 1. 5 hours in an effort to obtain more uniform dimensions during the next two 0. 5-hour periods at 1500°C, but only partial success was achieved. The slight densification that took place was greater at the top than at the bottom of the inverted specimen, and the shrinkage crack persisted. Little change was noted after 1 hour at 1600°C.

In 1 hour at 1650°C, the density increased by 10. 7%. The outside diameter at the top became less than that at the bottom. The previous crack healed, and a new crack developed near the bottom. This behavior was clearly due to the formation of more liquid phase and was comparable to that which gave rise to similar effects at 1500°C.

The final density achieved was 6. 09 g/cm³, which is higher than the theoretical value of 5. 89 g/cm³ for a fully dense 70-30 wt% mixture. The complex sintering behavior indicates that these components do not remain in a simple mechanical mixture when heated to 1650°C. In the absence of quantitative information on phase relationships in the system, it is not reasonable to express the density values obtained as percentages of.

The results of these tests indicate that additional modifications in the procedure must be made if acceptable control rod components are to be fabricated by cold pressing and sintering. A technique is being investigated in which the pressed specimen of pre-reacted material is supported.

Can be crushed, pressed, and used again. Preliminary results indicate that the sintered specimen is dimensionally uniform and crack-free. However, self-welding, reminiscent of the crack-healing observed at 1650°C in the stage-wise sintering experiments, may be a problem if this method is employed.

Metallographic examinations have not been completed of the coupons fuel. Washing, weighing, measuring, and other steps, such as gamma spectrometry, were finished, and the specimens are being prepared for metallographic mounting. The nature of the environment became apparent during the subsequent experiments described below. When the metallographic observations, which are expected to show corrosion of molybdenum and some deterioration of pyrolytic graphite, become available, the findings will be reviewed.

Analyses were completed of the gas in the capsules irradiated in experimental assembly ORNL-MTR-47-4 at 725°C to an integrated flux of 10^7 neutrons/cm. These INOR-8 capsules, described in detail earlier, were equipped with a central thermocouple and a 1/2-inch-diameter graphite core.

The gas analyses of capsules 4, 12, and 45 are reported in Table 5. 1, and data derived from these analyses are compared in Table 5. 2 with the data reported previously for capsules 6, 24, and 36. The gas samples were obtained by a puncturing operation, which released the gas into an evacuated collection manifold. Usually, four.

Evacuated 200-mL collection bottles were opened and closed in succession so that a little more than one-half of the remaining gas was collected each time at successively lower pressures. The higher pressure samples were analyzed promptly by mass spectrometry, and a few of the lower pressure samples were analyzed later for confirmation. Unfortunately, samples that were allowed to age showed evidence of reaction of the fluorine, and the data obtained were usually not regarded as quantitative.

The data of Table 5. 2 are tabulated in chemical terms to facilitate assessment of radiation-induced chemical alteration of the fuel. There were about 875 milliequivalents of fluoride ion in the large capsules, of which 2h could be accounted for as UF4. In the extreme case, about 3. 5% of the total fluoride was converted to F2 or CF4 in the gas phase.

The second column in Table 5. 2 reflects the different flux levels at different capsule locations within the sodium metal bath used as a heat transfer or cooling medium during irradiation. The high value for capsule 4 arose from a higher uranium concentration. The dosimeter wires indicated about twice as great a range of flux levels as was anticipated.

Comparison of the krypton and xenon analyses with expected yields reveals a holdup of xenon that is attributable to the formation of the recently discovered, relatively nonvolatile compounds XeFs and XeF4. The literature provides a recent reference to a reaction of xenon with Fp at room temperature to produce, primarily, XeFs, in which the activation energy was supplied by a mercury-arc lamp with an effective wave atoms. In view of the analytical precision available for the measured krypton production, the agreement with the theoretical prediction was as good as could be expected. More abundant gaseous yields, such as Fo and CF4, were amenable to measurement to within probably better than 3%, even though these samples were analyzed under less than ideal conditions.

The sixth column (Table 5. 2) affords an indication that, within capsule types, longer decay periods corresponded to larger relative yields of fluorine in the gas phase, although the correlation is ragged. The total fluorine data include both Fp and CF4, which was interpreted as a secondary product from the reaction of fluorine with graphite. An assessment of fluorine generation as a function of estimated decay energy has not yet been attempted, but the variation in total fluorine released per unit of uranium burned indicates that no consistent correlation with decay energy will be found. Where small but significant amounts of Op were encountered, the fluorine content was corrected to include this oxygen, which was also considered to be a reaction product of the fluorine that came from the collection apparatus. The air in-leakage, recognized by the presence of N2, never exceeded a few percent and thus did not significantly affect the analyses.

The amount of fluorine in the gas phase per unit of energy generated during the exposure (column 5, Table 5. 2) was a possible basis for comparing the results from different experiments. Two of the four capsules irradiated in experiment ORNL-MIR-17-3 included relatively porous graphite boats that were prepermeated with fuel. These capsules yielded relatively little fluorine, all in the form of CF4, and the data agreed with the results from capsule 6 of experiment ORNL-MTR-17-4, even though the power density in experiment 47-3 was more than four times as great. The other two capsules in experiment 47-3 gave ten times as much fluorine, again as CF4, but they were still low in total fluorine production by a factor of more than ten in comparison with the modal trend in experiment 47-4. The gas-collecting system used in experiment 47-2 was not compatible with F2 and, in retrospect, was recognized to have consumed some fluorine, although probably not enough to negate the rough comparisons cited above. These comparisons indicate that neither power density nor total energy was directly controlling in a simple manner. The predominance of CF4 in contrast with unreacted F2 in the gas space of the 47-3 capsules could have been influenced by the large area of accessible graphite surface (a feature of the design) in the presence of a radiation field.

To be converted to volumes. The amount of CF4 produced, which might be expected to depend on the F's pressure, as well as on the interrelated decay energy and time, appeared to increase with decay time in a sporadic manner, suggesting an influence of the accessibility of the graphite core, which is dependent on the conditions in the frozen salt ingot. The indicated amounts of gas accumulated in the large capsules in a vapor space of about 44. 5 cm, which was not occupied by frozen salt or graphite. Intercommunicating voids within the graphite were estimated to have a volume of 0. 25 cm³. Two of the capsules produced fluorine in an amount corresponding to the contained UF4. This was thought to be a coincidence, although in the liquid state, where equilibrium could have prevailed, such a coincidence would have been regarded with suspicion, since uranium is the most easily reduced of the fuel components.

Metallographic Evaluation of the Wall of a Capsule from Experimental Assembly ORNL-MTR-47: When the large amounts of fluorine evolution were first recognized upon puncturing capsule 24, a detailed metallographic examination of the capsule was made. The INOR-8 wall, nominally 50 mils thick, was examined at magnifications up to 1000X for evidence of F's attack and for possible irradiation-accelerated corrosion.

A preliminary evaluation of the capsule at low magnification showed no general attack of the magnitude expected from Fp at elevated temperatures. All surfaces, including the salt-vapor interface, appeared to be uniformly unaffected. A thin nonmetallic film was found on parts of the inner metal surface that was easily removed by scratching; it was not present in sufficient quantity for analysis. The surface of the metal did not contain uranium, in accord with observations from autoradiography and chemical analyses of material leached from the capsule welds, as discussed below.

High-magnification examinations were made of sections of the capsule wall in the vapor region and at various locations exposed to salt, including the interface where maximum corrosion was expected and the weldment. No attack, either uniform or preferential, was observed in any of these specimens. A transverse section, as shown in Fig.

It was evident from the metallographic examination that the severe attack normally caused by Fp gas on nickel alloys at these high test temperatures was not present. This lent confidence to the view that high-pressure fluorine was not generated by the molten salt. The examination also confirmed previous experimental work which indicated that irradiation does not cause accelerated attack in this system.

The photographs were scanned for evidence of precipitation of uranium on solid surfaces, where tell-tale evidence of embedded fission products might have been discovered; none was found. The distribution of fission products appeared to be uniform throughout the salt, except for bulbous regions of low activity that were distinguishable at the rounded bottoms of capsules 12 and 45. These were found to be voids, resembling gas bubbles, that had stuck to the metal wall. Some of the specimens were photographed in a tilted position, as in. 3, so that the surface of the salt was visible at an angle. Autoradiographs of recovered graphite cores were also made with the same camera. Here, the activity was less uniform, but any pronounced concentrations were associated only with a few visible remnants of salt that had not drained or separated cleanly and that could be explained by circumstances other than the wetting of graphite by the melt. If loss of fluorine by the salt had occurred in the liquid state, a recognizable deposit of uranium should have been in evidence. The absence of such deposits is a further indication that the partitioned fluorine was not present prior to or during the last time the fuel was molten.

The fuel contracts about 20 to 25% on freezing, and consequently the presence of contraction voids is not unusual in frozen ingots. The voids, first noted as a peculiarity in the autoradiographs of capsules 12 and 45, were examined after the capsules were sectioned in a longitudinal plane. The voids were unusual in that they were located at the bottom of the capsules and in that their shape and size were those of approximately hemispheric bubbles 1 to 3 mm in diameter. Further, they were positioned on from capsule 24, and the smaller capsules led to the conclusion that bubbles had occurred in all capsules but that no metallographically detectable effects were associated with their presence. They were presumed to have been filled with helium of the same composition as the cover gas. Although several relatively plausible mechanisms for the growth of these bubbles are available, the apparent metastability against buoyancy remains as a curiosity.

No deleterious indications with respect to compatibility were found in the exposure-induced bubbles, and no bubbles of appreciable size were found adjacent to the graphite cores against the bottoms of the graphite liners in the smaller capsules. However, there were a number of flattened voids or bubbles that were 0. 5 mm in height and more than three times that in.

Chemical analyses were made, which indicated that no uranium had deposited on the capsule walls during experiment 47-4. There was concern on this point, mainly because of the considerable loss of fluoride from the irradiated salt. These results conform with previous indications.

A section of the capsule wall, approximately 6 cm in area, which had been exposed to the molten salt in capsule 24, was selected for checking for uranium deposition. The adhering salt, which might have obscured the results, was removed by dissolution in a dilute ammonium oxalate solution, and the specimen was then rinsed with distilled water. The specimen was leached for 2 hr with hot 6 M HNO3 to dissolve any deposits on the surface of the metal. The leach solution was analyzed for uranium by a fluorometric method, which had a limit of detection of 100 g of uranium per milliliter.

As originally planned, the salt from two of the capsules was to be removed by melting under an inert atmosphere so that samples suitable for reducing-power determinations could be preserved. As previously indicated, through no fault of the apparatus, the plan did not work. The melting allowed reduced phases to form that probably included metal. Evidently, this led to a slurry that would not drain completely; the one-half to two-thirds which did drain was pale green in color from the presence of UF4, which showed that a uniformly complete readjustment of the reduction had not occurred. The portion melted out of capsule 36, which was the only capsule on which a melt-out was attempted, gave an analyzed reducing power of 0. 34 milliequivalent per gram as compared with the 0. 89 wt% expected for the fuel as a whole.

For comparison, the fuel from capsule 24, even though it had been exposed in lump form to air, was also analyzed. A reducing power of 1. 5 milliequivalents per gram was found, compared with the 0. 3 value expected on the basis of the cover gas analysis. There is a possibility that additional fluorine escaped during the 40-day interval for capsule 36 and the 51-day interval for capsule 24 between puncturing and chemical analyses. The longer delay might explain the discrepancy for capsule 24, as the uranium was that shown in Table 5. 3, but further work on the isotopic distribution was postponed until samples from all capsules could be evaluated at the same time in an effort to clarify discrepancies in the amount.

The reducing power of the fuel salt was measured by dissolving the salt in a boric and hydrochloric acid mixture, which reacted with the reduced constituents to yield hydrogen. The amount of hydrogen, 2 to 9 mm, gave the reducing power, after a correction of about 0. 1 mm, as determined by an immediately subsequent blank run on the same solution for.

The weighed sample of fuel, about 1/2 g, was placed with an equal amount of boric acid in the dissolving flask. The flask was swept with carbon dioxide to displace all air and then partially evacuated so that the required 35 ml of 6 M HCl could be added. When the sample had been dissolved with the aid of a magnetic mixer, the gas was swept through a KOH solution with a stream of CO2. The CO2 was absorbed, leaving the H2, which was transferred to a thick-walled centrifuge cone that served as a gas-collection test tube. The test tube, which could be decontaminated and removed from the hot-cell walls, was closed with a rubber diaphragm that permitted hermetic transfers by means of hypodermic needles.

Initially, air had been displaced from the test tube by water. A measured 1 ml of helium was introduced through a hypodermic needle while displacing an equal amount of water through a second hypodermic needle. The measured amount of helium served as a standard against which the hydrogen was assayed by ratios from mass spectrometry.

Capsule 24 was sawed through longitudinally, with the graphite core included, as soon as the presence of fluorine was recognized. The generally good, unaltered condition of the contents, reported previously, was confirmed by the complete dissection of all the capsules, except capsule 36, which was not available because it had been used in the melt-out attempt.

Vapor-phase region to expose the frozen liquid level for inspection. Little or no evidence of an accumulated scum was observable, but the visibility conditions were unsatisfactory because of the blackened nature of the salt surface. A tubing cutter that was operable in an inert atmosphere had been developed, but it was used only on capsule 36. Removal of the capsule tops involved the extraction of the appended thermocouple wells in the case of the large capsules. Generally, this was accomplished easily, although some abrading and fracturing of the upper surface of the salt occurred in the vicinity of the shoulder of the well.

At some locations corresponding to the liquid level rise and fall during freeze-thaw cycles, a black powder had accumulated on the metal wall. Frequently, both white and discolored droplets of condensed salt were lodged on the powdery coating. The coating, although it obscured the metal surface, was present in too small an amount for satisfactory.

Capsules 12 and 45 were opened without having been potted in Araldite resin, which was normally used to ensure that the contents remained in position. In these cases, diametral cuts were made in the cylindrical metal walls, but the salt was penetrated only slightly, and the metal halves were pried apart. In capsule 45, the salt adhered to the metal in two halves, one of which retained the graphite core. Capsule 12 received less delicate manipulation, and the upper portion of the salt and the graphite fell out; the bottom portions of the halves remained intact. The exposed cross sections were photographed and examined for surface layers, but none were found. The cause of the low activity noted at the bottoms of the capsules in the autoradiographs was not evident. The graphite cores that were recovered intact were stored.

Nothing unusual was seen, except for an indication of flattened bubbles at the bottom, when the small capsules (4 and 6) were sawed longitudinally down the middle. The salt was sampled, and a portion of capsule 1h, characterized by the highest power density, was prepared for metallographic examination. The potting resin partially penetrated a thin annulus resulting from contraction of the salt ingot away from the graphite, and the salt thus cemented was difficult to sample. The results are not.

In preparation for a proposed hot-cell experiment in which graphite cores from the irradiated capsules would be baked under vacuum and the evolved gases analyzed, a similar experiment was performed on unexposed cores. Three control cores were fluorinated at room temperature under a fluorine pressure of 8 to 5 psig for 95 hr and, after sweeping away most of the excess F's with helium, heated to 1200°C under vacuum. The evolved gases were continuously collected by a Toepler pump as they were released during the period of increasing temperature. No CF4 was found. The presence of 3% SiF4 indicated that traces of free fluorine had been liberated in the quartz bakeout apparatus, while the bulk of the total of 3 to 6 cm of gas collected was H2, CO plus N2, and CO2. As far as could be concluded from the unexposed cores, a negligible amount of chemisorbed fluorine was retained by the graphite. No sudden release of gases was encountered during heating. Both exposure of the control graphite to air and the effects of irradiation caused differences in conditions between the test trial and the proposed hot-cell experiment, but no contraindications were found.

Product of the F's or free fluorine with graphite. No evidence of chemical incompatibility at high temperatures has been found. The irregular pattern of fluorine generation in response to slightly changed conditions in otherwise similar capsules suggests that one or more of the important factors has not yet been recognized or measured. One factor under suspicion is the freezing history. In phase-behavior studies, both the crystallization path and crystallite sizes have been recognized as virtually nonreproducible in supposedly duplicate tests, except in the case of extremely slow cooling in which equilibrium behavior is closely approached. Future experiments are planned in which cooling rates can be varied.

The fifth capsule irradiation experiment was completed on January 23, 1963, after approximately 4 1/2 months of operation in the MIR. This capsule, described previously, was designed for studying the formation of gaseous products both during and following irradiation of molten salt fuel in contact with graphite and INOR-8 alloy. Four of the six capsules in the assembly were sealed, as in earlier irradiations. The previous set (ORNL-MTR-4:7-4) of irradiation capsules was found to contain both CF4 and F2, and it was necessary to know whether these gases were released to the capsule atmosphere during reactor operation or only while the fuel was at low temperature following reactor irradiation. Two capsules were therefore equipped with purge gas lines for continuous monitoring of pressure and for sampling. At the time the capsules were designed, only CF4 had been observed in irradiated capsules, and consequently some of the materials of construction were not entirely suitable for exposure to F2. The capsules and the gas-purging system appear, however, to have functioned satisfactorily, indicating that the F2 release probably was small during.

The power density in one of the purged capsules was twice that in the other. The sealed capsules were designed to include different ratios of graphite and metal surfaces exposed to the fused salt fuel. By using various ratios, a range of oxidation-reduction levels was obtained to bracket.

Equipment at the MIR was altered to include provisions for removing gas samples and to measure the pressure in the capsules both during operation and in reactor shutdown periods. This equipment was calibrated precisely to ensure that purge samples included a large and known fraction of the gas collected. A schematic diagram of the new equipment is shown.

The operating conditions of the experiment were varied throughout the test to include as nearly as possible those anticipated in different regions of the MSRE. Temperature and power were varied independently but were held constant for the periods required to collect gas samples. Fuel temperatures during reactor operation ranged from a few hundred degrees to 1500°F, with power densities in the fuel varying from 3 to 80 W/cm. The gas samples were taken by isolating the capsule for a period of time and then purging the accumulated gases into an evacuated sample bomb.

The samples taken with the reactor at an intermediate power and the salt frozen provided information for evaluating the effect of intense ionizing radiation on the evolution of CF4 and Fp from the fuel with the salt frozen but at various temperatures. Gas accumulation times were 1 to 3. 5 hr, with the fuel temperatures varied from 180 to 480°F. The power density of the fuel is estimated to have been in the range of 3 to 10.

Gas samples taken during reactor shutdowns were for determining the composition of the gases evolved when the capsules were cold. The overall release rate was measured as a function of time by monitoring the pressure during sample collection. The other two types of samples, which were taken during the freezing or thawing of the fuel, were for evaluating the effect of a phase transition on the release of gases.

The pressure rise in the capsules that occurred during reactor shutdown appeared to be a function of the irradiation history immediately before the shutdown. In general, a delay period that varied from hours to days occurred before the first indication of pressure rise. The longer delays and lower rates of pressure rise were associated with a previous of pressure buildup decreased slowly with time, and in no case was a shutdown long enough for the pressure to reach equilibrium. The shutdown gas samples contained considerably more radioactivity than those taken with the reactor at power and the salt molten. Gamma-ray spectrometer analyses of these samples showed the presence of Te and I-131, whereas the other samples showed only noble gases.

During the accumulation periods, with the reactor at low power and the salt frozen, there was usually no indication of pressure rise; however, the accumulation times were only 1 to 3 hr, and the data are not considered to be definitive. Upon reactor shutdown, the capsule lines were purged with helium for 21 hr to remove gaseous products. Residual activity, probably deposited in the V/8-in. -diam tubing, produced activity readings of 2 to 4 r/hr at 3 in. Following removal from the beam hole, the experimental assembly was sectioned, and valves were installed on the severed ends of the purge lines in the MIR hot cell.

Of inlet and exit lines for gas sampling, valves on these lines outside the shielding isolated volumes of a little over 100 cm³ in which the evolved gases were allowed to accumulate in a 12-psia helium cover gas. Sampling was accomplished by sweeping the gas with helium into 250-cm³ evacuated nickel collection bottles that were replaceable in groups of six for each of the two capsules (see Fig. 7).

The sampled capsules contained 25 g of fuel from which thorium had been omitted and which had the composition shown in Table 5. 6. The flux did not permit matching both the power density and the operating temperature of the MSRE in the same capsule; accordingly, a twofold difference in uranium concentration was used in the two capsules. The purified fuel was originally loaded in the form of molded ingots, rather than by liquid transfer, and after the graphite cores were cleaned with a molten-salt flush, they were handled only in a dry helium atmosphere. The graphite was selected from a preliminary delivery of graphite bars for the Engineering Test Loop (ETL). Cores without visible fissures or striations were obtained, but there was much spoilage during their selection.

Of the sample, there was a large decrease in the activity, most of which tended to remain on the container walls. Routinely, the samples were first scanned for Fo in a laboratory at the Oak Ridge Gaseous Diffusion Plant and then analyzed there if Fp were found. Otherwise, and in most cases, the remainder of the transferred sample was analyzed in an ORNL laboratory at the Y-12 Plant.

In assessing the requisite sensitivity of the gas measurements, it was necessary to consider how much Fp or CF4 evolution might be tolerable from the MSRE fuel. As a rough approximation, a minimum inventory, as (thermal) represented an allowable limit, a yield of Fo of 10 moles or 61 m1/Mwd could be tolerated with this much UF4. A factor of one-half is required to express the above amounts in terms of CF4. For 5000 liters per day of off-gas flow from the MSRE at the full power of 10 Mw, the equivalent concentration of Fp in the off-gas to correspond to the maximum allowable rate of reduction of uranium would be 120 ppm.

The hotter of the two sampled capsules, that is, the one with the higher uranium concentration, was designed to produce 900 watts. If it is assumed that the yield of Fp in this capsule was proportional to the power density, the MSRE tolerance limit corresponded to a daily concentration increase of 550 ppm. With only these simplifying assumptions, the tolerable daily increase in CF4 content in the 100 ml of capsule cover gas was 110 ppm.

Although the capsule gas-collecting system, containing as it did stainless steel in some regions at intermediate temperatures, was not suitable for preserving small amounts of Fz when the fuel was molten, the theoretical limit of sensitivity to CF4 should have been of the order of 1 ppm per day of accumulation time under operating conditions. This estimate was derived mainly from the considerations that 5 ppm was measurable by mass spectrometry and that 5-day accumulation periods were feasible. In practice, the concentrations of CF4 in the capsule gas were generally undetectable, and in the 32 samples so far analyzed, the CF4 content never exceeded 12 ppm. These amounts, which are too low to be of absolute significance, were low in comparison with the estimated tolerance limit by a factor of 100 or more. Xenon and krypton were found in the expected quantities.

Two points should be noted in regard to the sampling for Fo. First, both previous tests at K-25 and recent tests carried out there in support of the current irradiation studies showed that Fo scarcely attacks pretreated stainless steel at temperatures below 200°C, but at temperatures above 200°C, the rate increases rapidly. Even when Fs is contained in prefluorinated nickel, a loss is likely to be noted in a period of weeks at room temperature.

Amounts might be in error in the low direction. Second, any Fs potentially produced in the molten fuel were expected to react with the capsule contents, fuel included, before it reached the stainless steel. The absence of CF4 in the gas collected at operating temperature could be considered as presumptive evidence that Fp was not being produced in significant quantities. The peculiarly low rate of attack of metals by CF4 was noted in previous MSRE studies and is implied in other work in this report (see Chapter 6).

The lifetime of the experiment was originally thought to be determined by the rate of plugging by salt vapor deposited in the gas lines. Accordingly, high temperatures were generally avoided during the earlier MIR cycles. More freedom in the choice of conditions was exercised in later cycles; however, and at termination, the gas line from the hotter capsule was partially plugged. Sample accumulation periods of 3 days were originally considered as feasible without interruptions; subsequently, periods of 10 and 17 days were achieved with only minor interruptions.

Samples taken following pressure rises (described in the following section) were expected to contain F2, but this was at first difficult to prove for two reasons. The collection apparatus, even after prefluorinated nickel collection bottles were available, had not been completely pretreated with fluorine and thus consumed some of the evolved fluorine. Second, samples of the gas taken after the pressure increases raised the activity level in the sampling station to an almost intolerable extent. Accordingly, there was a reluctance to collect fluorine samples because they jeopardized the exchange of sample bottles required for obtaining gas during operation, which was the main objective. After confirming a few failures to detect F2 in samples following a pressure rise, a similar sample was obtained in which the F2 content was 5. 84. This was little more than half the expected amount, but it was a definite indication that the gas was fluorine. Little CF4 was noted in samples collected during shutdown, presumably because the F2 did not have sufficient access to graphite over long periods of time. Fluorine that was trapped in the graphite should have reacted on heating.

Additional light was thrown on the source of the large amounts of F's encountered in the 47-4 capsules when pressure rises were observed during shutdown periods in the two of the 47-5 capsules that were equipped for pressure measurement and sample collection. An attempt was made to correlate the rate of pressure rise, attributed to radiolytic Fo generation, and the rate of absorption of decay energy of the fission products in the fuel. Calorimetric data on fission-product decay power were used since.

Energy absorbed, rather than total energy released, was effective in radiolysis. The decay power curve was integrated graphically to give a plot of total energy absorbed as a function of cooling time. The multiplication of the energy ordinate of this curve by a G-value in appropriate units yielded a theoretical Fo generation curve for this particular value. The G-value is defined in conventional units as the molecules of product per 100 eV of energy absorbed. In practice, a family of energy curves was prepared by multiplying the energy ordinates of the original decay energy curve by appropriate constants, and these curves were compared with the pressure rise data plotted on the same time scale. The G-value was then calculated from the multiplying constant that gave the theoretical curve most closely fitting the pressure-rise data.

The best fits for the pressure-rise data obtained during the shutdown following the first 3-week cycle in the MIR are shown in Figs. 5. 8 and 5. 9. The "induction period," during which there was no pressure rise, required a translation of the origins downward and to the right.

The close correspondence of the pressure data in 0. 8 to the expected shape of the selected energy curves may be largely artificial. The ratios of the energy ordinates remained constant at 0. 57; however, which was as close as could be expected to the ratio of the power levels in the two capsules, and the existence of induction periods required a shift, at least in the ordinate direction, for any matching of fluorine production to decay energy. Translations in the ordinate direction accommodated both the energy absorbed in causing crystal damage, which presumably must first occur to a critical extent before Fo appears, and also the fluorine which was reconsumed or permanently held for any cause.

Translation along the abscissa implied a time delay such as might occur in a diffusion-controlled process in which the average time of translation of the diffusing species remains constant as it would in a steady-state process. The diffusing species could have been fluorine atoms, but there seemed to be little precedent in solid-state theory to support such a possibility. Although the hypothesis seemed plausible that the release of Fp from the solid fuel, which was mainly LiBeF4, was diffusion-controlled, further speculations were postponed until the results from other shutdown periods were considered. The data on the subsequent pressure rises were, in part, fragmentary, and they have not yet been analyzed in detail. There were more similarities than dissimilarities, however, when compared with the general pattern expected if decay energy were a controlling factor.

The occurrence of induction periods prior to the pressure rise was confirmed; and in the case of the lower power capsule, the induction period extended throughout the shutdown periods for the second, third, and fifth reactor shutdowns. No simple relationship was found between the duration of an induction period and the energy released during that time, as might have been expected if the critical amount of damage prior to fluorine release had remained constant.

The literature describes a 22% decrease in the density of LiF as a result of a dose of 1 x 10^7 to 2 x 10^7 neutrons/cm. It was interesting that in the irradiation described by Spaepen, there was also an initial period of low G value, corresponding to an induction period. Nine-tenths of the density decrease took place between dose levels compared with 0. 037 for the over-all exposure.

The pressures rises that were encountered in the sampled capsules were sufficient to represent a pronounced alteration of the fuel beyond limits of reduction that were deemed safe in the MSRE. This meant that results from later cycles were possibly not applicable to the MSRE fuel, but the possibility that marked differences in the evolution of gases would occur was considered to be remote. Among the liberties taken with this altered fuel in experiment 47-5 were low-power operations, as described in the following section, in which fissioning was caused to occur in solid fuel at relatively low temperatures.

The design of the pit for inserting the 47-5 experimental assembly into the reactor allowed for considerable variations in flux by adjusting the depth of insertion and for limited temperature control by regulating a gas gap that controlled the rate of heat loss. No independent variations between capsules were possible, and the available range was insufficient to reduce the capsule temperature below the freezing point of the.

Fuel at full MIR power (40 MW). Therefore, periods of low-power operation were arranged during MIR startups, and the capsules were maintained at full retraction and minimum gas gap to observe the behavior at different levels of fissioning in the solid fuel. Four-hour periods were involved, and temperatures were steady during the last 2 or 3 hours of the period.

In view of the copious evolution of F0 during shutdowns, the results presented in Table 5. 7 were somewhat surprising. They imply either a pronounced difference with temperature, possibly as an annealing effect that seals the crystals, or as an accelerated rate of recombination, or a greatly decreased G value for Fp evolution from fission fragments.

The fission-fragment spike. The 0. 43-psia pressure rise referred to in Table 5. 7 was of interest as a possible instance of a time lag of the annealing effect since following an initial 65-min period, no pressure increase could be detected in the next 2 hr. This measurement was made immediately after a thorough helium flush at the end of a scheduled shutdown during which the evolution of Fz had been proceeding as usual. Even for just the 65-min period, the G value was less than half that previously encountered at 95°F, that is at the estimated ambient temperature during shutdowns. The temperature of the sodium bath and hence of the stainless steel gas lines was too low to have caused appreciable loss of Fo by reaction with the walls. Thus, there currently appear to be no potential problems associated with Fz evolution in freeze valves and freeze.

A monitoring manifold was successfully attached to the capsules in ORNL hot cells within 11 days after the end of exposure in the MIR. At this stage, the pressure increased steadily at a rate corresponding to about 13 and 6 ml per day of Fs (STP), respectively, in the two capsules, compared with about 4 ml per day sometimes found for the hotter capsule during shutdowns. Although the capsules and associated tubing in the monitored volume (≈100 cm) had been evacuated at the beginning of the monitoring period in the hot cell, large amounts of O2 and a few percent of CO2 were found in the collected gas that was otherwise more than one-half fluorine. The O2, which diminished sporadically in subsequent samples, was tentatively attributed to a fluorine-induced release following the reaction of the walls, and possibly of the fuel, with air during the 2 1/2 hr that the gas lines were open in the MIR hot cells while the assembly nose was severed from the accessory equipment, and isolating valves were installed on the inlet and outlet gas lines at about 4 ft from the capsules.

The jacketed assembly that contained the capsules was provided in the hot cell with a specially constructed heater in order to study the effect of temperature. There were indications that a marked decrease in the rate of gas evolution occurred between 50 and 85°C.

The main conclusion drawn from the analyses of the cover gas is that CF4 was not evolved in significant amounts under operating conditions. The considerable variation in the extent to which CF4 was found in earlier experiments was only roughly explained when the evolved fluorine was rapidly removed; as in experiment 47-5, almost no CF4 was found. The fluorine that accumulated to a pressure of 1/2 atm or more over a period of days at the end of irradiation in experiment 47-5 produced a concentration of about 0. 26 CF4. There was no evidence of the presence of CF4, except where F5 evolved from decay energy in frozen fuel was found.

An important result from experiment 47-5 was the confirmation of surmises made in explaining the source of the Fp found in experiment 47-1. An unexpected bonus was the strong indication that frozen salt at temperatures of 100°C or higher was not prone to evolve Fp, even with fissioning occurring in the crystals. Additional experiments are planned that will provide a greater range of independent variation of temperature and dose, and post-irradiation examinations are continuing. A point of possible interest for future irradiations was the role played by the uranium cation concentration in providing a buffer in the form of a variable valence reservoir that might have helped control, in an inverse direction, the steady-state concentration of free fluorine in the fissioning melt and thus might have reduced the potential rate of production of CF₄.

Previous experience with MSRE fuel mixtures consisting of LiF, BeF2, ZrF4, UF6, and ThF4 indicated that U+ ions do not substitute for 3LiF - 4ZrF4. However, the fact that the simple compounds ZrF4 and UF6 form a continuous series of solid solutions led to an interest in a more thorough study of the solubility of UF6 in LiF-ZrF4 mixtures. An investigation of the system LiF-ZrF4-UF6 was therefore initiated. The results obtained so far have established some of the temperature-composition relationships along boundary paths separating the primary phases and have shown the occurrence of the two invariant points: the peritectic at LiF-ZrF4-UF6 (60-14-26 mole %) and the eutectic at 539°C involving (62-24-14 mole %). Optical properties and x-ray diffraction data obtained from the region of the ternary system that has been explored thus far are identical to those found for the pure binary LiF-ZrF4 phases and therefore indicate that no appreciable exchange of Li+ and F- ions occurs in these compounds.

Radiation of solid MSRE fuel materials can, under some circumstances, cause a loss of fluorine and a consequent reduction of UF6 to UF3. For this reason, there has been a revival of 2. 5 mole% at 650°C. The solubility of UF3 should resemble that of PuF3. Current examinations of the system UF3-UF6 have shown that no intermediate compounds are formed. Thermal-gradient quenching experiments indicated that the freezing-point depressions were rather large and resulted in a eutectic with 25 mole% UF3 at 860°C. Although no appreciable solubility of ue in UF3 was observed, UF3 appeared to form a solid solution containing approximately 35 mole% UF6 at the solidus. The optical properties of the saturated UF3 solid solution differed from those of pure UF3 only in a slightly increased double refraction and a slightly reduced refractive index (1. 72).

The liquidus surface of the LiF-UF3-UF4 system is dominated by the primary phase UF3-UF4, a solid solution that extends to within 5 mole % of the LiF-UF4 limiting system. As found earlier with complex compounds involving other alkali halides, a significant number of UT sites in the crystalline compounds 7Li-6UF4 and LiF-4UF4 can be occupied by U5. Uranium trifluoride is not highly soluble in molten fluoride mixtures.

At around 500°C, because of its high melting point (~1400°C), mixtures having compositions near that of the LiF-UF eutectic (27 mole % UF) could accommodate approximately 5 mole % of UF3 in the liquid state in the temperature range 500 to 550°C. In this composition region, the crystallizing solids are 4LiF-UF, LiF, and UF3.

Thermal-gradient quenching experiments were conducted to determine. These findings suggested that the danger of disproportionation would be encountered long before the physical solubility of UF3 was exceeded in the MSRE. Although only UF3 was added to the starting mixture, some UF3 was found in samples equilibrated above the liquidus. Some samples containing material from both above and below the liquidus appeared not to have formed UF3, perhaps because solidified salt served as an inert container for this melt. Future experiments will be made in platinum in the hope of diminishing disproportionation.

The melting temperature of this mixture is sufficiently low to make it useful as the core fluid for the reactor. A preliminary investigation of similar compositions in the corresponding ThF system indicated the presence of a eutectic melting at ~570°C.

A proposal was made that 1 to 10 mg of Po be added to the fuel. The Po bombarding the beryllium, lithium, and fluorine in the melt with 5. 3-MeV alpha particles would serve as an internal neutron source for certain experiments. In order to anticipate the chemical behavior of polonium in a reactor, its reported properties were reviewed. As a result, it was concluded that the addition should first be experimentally evaluated in the laboratory, for, although polonium may dissolve and be distributed uniformly in the melt, it may, instead, be deposited uselessly on the container wall. No problems with vapor pressure or attack of the graphite moderator were anticipated.

Interest in the behavior of XeF derives, in part, from the apparent occurrence of the compound in irradiated capsules containing MSRE fuel and also from the attendant complication of analyzing for xenon from fissioned MSRE fuel. Xenon tetrafluoride was prepared for study by reacting the elements at about 400°C; it was then identified, and its purity verified by infrared analysis. The compound was sublimed in a vacuum into specially dried quartz capillary tubes and sealed off. Single crystals of two phases were grown in these tubes and were characterized by x-ray.

A mass action effect will cause ZrO2 to precipitate initially, and Zr may complex oxide ions and thus produce an appreciable "oxide capacity in the melt. " There was, however, a need for more quantitative information on the solubilities of UO2, ZrO2, and BeO, as well as on their mass action or equilibrium behavior in mixtures of flush salt and fuel salt. Accordingly, oxide precipitation studies, similar to those reported previously, were continued.

In these experiments, melts of LiBeF4, ZrF4, and fuel salt of known weight and composition, usually 2 to 3 kg, were purified with HF and H2. Weighed increments of BeO were added as a fine powder that had been calcined at 800°C. Stirring was accomplished by sparging continuously with helium. After each oxide addition, samples of the melt, usually about 25 g, were withdrawn into hydrogen-fired copper tubing filter sticks. In most cases, the weights of the samples taken were determined. Equilibration periods of one day proved adequate for an apparently complete reaction of the added oxide.

These studies continue to be hampered by inconsistent results from attempts to obtain direct oxide analyses of the melts in the concentration range of interest, that is, less than 1000 ppm. In the present experiments, in which known amounts of BeO were added to known weights of melt; careful material balances between the oxide added and the oxide presumably removed by precipitation and by sampling were obtained as a means of estimating the oxide remaining in solution. In general, it was found that these calculated values were more self-consistent than the oxide analyses.

The MSRE coolant, which has also been prominently considered as a possible flush salt, has almost the same composition as the compound Li2BeF4. A log-log plot is presented in Figure 1 of the equilibrium U and Zr+ concentrations versus the calculated oxide-ion concentration for a precipitation experiment in which BeO was added to an Li2BeF4 (mole %) at 600°C. The straight lines of slope -2 drawn through the data points correspond to simple mass-action behavior for the reactions.

The solubility products indicate the following solubilities in Li2BeF4, initially free of Zr, U, and O at 600°C: UO2, 0. 014 moles/kg, and ZrO2, 0. 020 moles/g. Observed precipitation behavior generally agreed well with that expected for simple mass action relations, as shown by.

The addition of BeO to a Li2BeF4 melt that contained 5 mole % ZrF4 (the highest Zr concentration level studied at 1.3 moles/kg), which corresponded to that proposed for MSRE fuel, showed no indication of an oxide capacity before precipitation began. The data of 0. 2, as well as the calculated curve, were essentially consistent with quantitative precipitation, except at the lowest zirconium concentrations.

The initial precipitation of ZrO from a LiBeF2 melt containing 5 wt% fuel salt is shown in Fig. 3. While there was some indication from the Zr4+ chemical analyses that precipitation did not occur until 0. 04 moles/kg of BeO had been added, the scatter of the data from subsequent analyses (+24) suggested that this apparent oxide capacity was greater than 1 mole/kg (~5 wt% ZrF4). There was no conclusive evidence of ZrO complexing. Also, there was no evidence of U4+ precipitation (lower portion of Fig. 3), and no Th4+ precipitation was encountered in any of these experiments.

The complete results of the experiment with the LiqBeF melt containing 5 wt% fuel salt (LiF) from which the correlation in 0. 1 was obtained showed that 0. 023 moles of oxide per kg of melt (370 ppm) could be added before ZrO2 precipitation began. Precipitation of UO2 did not begin until 0. In the region of ZrO2 and UO2 saturation, the ratio region where BeO saturation had been reached, which was estimated to occur at an O2 concentration of 0. 07 moles per kg of melt (1100 ppm).

The results of a similar precipitation experiment in which 1 wt% fuel salt was present in the LiBeF2 melt are presented in Fig. 5. Here, there were two anomalies: (1) the analyses for the Zr and U concentrations were higher than expected, which suggested that some contamination had occurred, and (2) there was little or no oxide capacity, although nominally about 0. 05 moles of oxide per kg of melt (800 ppm) should have been necessary for ZrO2 precipitation, as indicated by the solid curves. Both these anomalies are resolvable if the contamination was such that in this experiment, the melt initially contained approximately 0. In such a case, the effect would have been that indicated by the dashed curves in Fig. 5.

It is apparent that oxide behavior in mixtures of flush salt and fuel salt can be predicted reasonably well from the simple solubility product behavior. This means that a flush salt such as Li2BeF can accumulate the oxide ion that may be present in the drained reactor system up to a limit determined by the amount of fuel salt which the flush salt incorporates because of incomplete drainage. The addition of Zr to the flush salt would provide added protection against UO2 precipitation and should dissolve the small amounts of UO2 that may be produced when the reactor is drained of fuel at the same time; however, such a flush salt can tolerate less oxide contamination without precipitation of ZrO2. Whether the precipitate would remain in slurry form has not been established.

These considerations suggest that the investigation of oxide behavior should be extended to include experiments at other temperatures. The possible adsorption of U by ZrO2 and also the possible formation of U(IV)-Zr(IV) oxide solid solutions could be investigated at the same time.

Recent vapor pressure measurements provided information on the MSRE fuel and were also useful for calculation of thermodynamic parameters in solutions of ions of widely disparate charge-to-radius ratios. The Rodebush-Dixon method of vapor pressure measurement was employed with an apparatus that was essentially a copper tubing version of the glass and metal equipment described by Beusman. Pressure differentials were observed by means of a differential pressure cell in conjunction with a strip-chart recorder. Manometric pressures below 100 mm Hg were read on absolute pressure gauges that were calibrated against a mercury manometer that was read by means of a suitable cathetometer. Pressures above 100 mm Hg were determined directly with the manometer. The vaporization pots, welded from INOR-8 and nickel, were similar to those used by Cantor et al.

Vapor pressure might set a limit on the amount of ZrF in MSRE-type fuel melts. The vapor pressures of the two melts described in Table 6. 1 were measured. The mixture containing about 4 mole % ZrF approximated the composition of MSRE fuel, and the other showed the effect of doubling the concentration of ZrF. Extrapolation of these results to the MSRE operating temperature indicates that the second mixture has a vapor pressure about twice that of the present MSRE fuel composition. This is probably more a consequence of increased acidity, on a fluoride donor basis, than of merely doubling the amount of a volatile constituent. The data are presented graphically, and the constants for the vapor-pressure equation are listed in Table 6. 1.

Binary systems were started, and the data obtained to date are presented. Values for pure LiF obtained in this work and those obtained previously indicate that further measurements need to be made for this compound, as well as for other compositions in this system.

As usually obtained by precipitation from an aqueous solution, LiF is such a light, fluffy powder that it is not conveniently handled by the equipment for preparing MSRE fuel. An attempt was therefore made to densify the material by heating it at moderate temperatures (500-650°C).

When allowed to solidify and cool to room temperature in a cylindrical crucible, a sample of CrF2 formed an ingot having a toroidal-shaped internal void but no noticeable distortion of the outer surface. If this void was assumed to be due only to contraction on freezing, and the small change in volume on further cooling was neglected, the total volume of the ingot, including the void, represented the volume of molten CrF2 at its freezing point. Such an ingot, weighing 736 g, had a total volume of 216 cm3. Therefore, the liquid density is about 3. 40.

An evaluation was made of the activity coefficients of ZrF4 at low concentration (20 mol% and less) in a fluoride melt similar to the MSRE fuel. In order to obtain the coefficients, liquidus temperatures were carefully measured in the region (0 to 20 mol% ZrF4) where crystalline LiF is the separating phase.

Yttrium, Y, was evaluated from published vapor-pressure measurements for the LiF-ZrF2 system. The calculated activity coefficients of ZrF2 that were the objective of the investigation are shown to be of quite low magnitude. These low activity coefficients are a measure of the high degree of chemical interaction or complexing between ZrF2 and LiF in these melts.

Since the unclad graphite moderator of the MSRE will comprise about 80% of the reactor core volume, the volatile impurities in the graphite are a possible source of contamination to the molten fluoride fuel mixtures. Of the various volatile impurities, water vapor will probably represent the greatest problem with respect to reactor operation. The release of sufficient water vapor into molten fluoride systems of the type to be used as MSRE fuel causes the precipitation of oxides and gives rise to corrosion. In the MSRE, the introduction of water vapor into the fuel system would probably result initially in the deposition of ZrO2. Consequently, the removal of water vapor and other volatile impurities from the graphite moderator before introducing molten fluorides into the reactor core is necessary.

As part of the MSRE startup operations (prior to salt loading), it is planned to heat the reactor core to about 650°C while circulating helium. Accordingly, the experimental program described previously for determining the characteristics of gas evolution from graphite under conditions simulating core heatup was continued. In these experiments, the effect of temperature and heating rates on moisture removal was of specific interest. The results provided a basis for an estimate of the moisture that may be released while preheating the MSRE reactor core.

Experimental Procedure: To simulate the helium purging operation during startup, pieces of graphite (6 to 12 inches in length) with the same cross-sectional configuration as designed for an MSRE moderator element were placed in a container. The container had gas entry and exit ports at each end and was mounted vertically in a tube furnace as part of a recirculating gas system. During operation, portions of the gas stream emerging from the graphite block were diverted through an electrolytic water analyzer sensitive to changes in water-vapor content in the purge gas over the range of 0 to 1000 ppm. Additionally, a gas-sampling system was available for mass spectrographic analyses of carbonaceous gases evolved during the experimental procedure. The main body of the circulating gas stream was directed through a magnesium perchlorate drying column and a cold trap to reduce the moisture content of the gas entering the graphite container to very low values. Furthermore, provisions were made for passing wet helium (saturated with water vapor at room temperature) over the graphite block surfaces to ensure reproducible starting conditions for repeated tests of a single graphite piece. Temperatures were monitored using a Chromel-Alumel.

During the preheating of the reactor core, the primary fuel pump is expected to circulate helium at a flow rate of about 75 liters/sec, and a maximum heating rate of approximately 30°C/hr is anticipated. If a uniform gas velocity through the reactor core is assumed, a flow rate of about 3 liters/min through the experimental loop approximates the gas flow conditions for a moderator element.

Experimental Results. Data that illustrate the evolution of moisture from 4 pieces of AGOT graphite and from an as-received piece of ETL graphite were reported previously but have been revised. The revisions include the removal of physically absorbed moisture at temperatures up to 150°C and the removal of what appears to be chemisorbed moisture over the temperature interval 200 to 400°C.

There are no provisions for an initial evacuation of gases from the MSRE reactor core prior to heatup, and since the graphite will almost certainly contain some entrapped air in its pores, it is expected that some products of the reaction of air with graphite will be produced during the preheating operation. In a similar experiment with ETL graphite, the accumulation of air and carbonaceous gases in the circulating gas stream at temperatures up to 700°C was found to be negligible. No further examinations of these aspects of gas evolution.

Under some circumstances, the evolution of chemisorbed moisture from graphite is probably diffusion-controlled. The consequent complication of the temperature dependence, which could occur in the MSRE startup operation, was the subject of a series of experiments with a single piece of ETL graphite at different heating rates. Prior to each trial, the canned graphite block was exposed to a circulating stream of moist helium for 2 hours. It was not established that a 2-hour exposure to the moist helium was sufficient to saturate the graphite completely, but the quantity of water removed during later trials was about the same as that obtained from the as-received specimens.

Discussion: Unless the MSRE graphite is markedly different from that studied, the release of moisture from the MSRE core should occur in two steps at temperatures below 400°C. Physically adsorbed water should be removed while heating the reactor core to about 150°C. The chemisorbed water will probably be evolved over the temperature interval 200 to 400°C. Upon decreasing the rate of graphite heating, the more tightly bound water would apparently be evolved at lower temperatures.

While the quantity of water present in the as-received moderator elements will probably depend on their handling history, there has been no evidence that the chemisorbed water content is ever very large. Because of the upper concentration limit (1000 ppm) of the moisture analyzer used for these experiments, the relatively large quantity of physically held water in as-received ETL graphite has not been accurately measured. In two experiments, more than 25 cm (STP) of water vapor per 100 cm of graphite was noted. The quantities of chemisorbed water in both as-received and pre-saturated pieces of ETL graphite are listed in Table 6. 3. The specified allowable oxygen contamination in the MSRE moderator graphite (30 cm of CO per 100 cm of graphite at 1800°C) is, however, equivalent to about 465 g.

In an attempt to evaluate the effectiveness of the MSRE startup procedure for removing volatile impurities from the graphite moderator elements, a high-temperature technique was used for analyzing the offgas. The sample was a small cylinder of ETL graphite previously removed and immediately reinserted in an as-received ETL graphite block from which the moisture was then removed by heating to 700°C as in the startup procedure. The small sample was then raised to 1800°C, and the evolved gases were analyzed. Of the 45 cm of additional gas removed, there were no gains in moisture or oxide during the transfer of the small graphite sample. 46% of the specified allowable oxide remained after the simulated startup procedure. As-received ETL graphite, however, after a thorough room-temperature evacuation, produced less than 10 cm of CO at 1800°C; so there may have been some contamination or a marked variation between the specimens studied.

In any case, the proposed MSRE procedure should be effective in removing water vapor from the unclad graphite moderator elements. Further, the effectiveness of this operation should be, within reason, independent of the physically absorbed moisture content of the graphite.

As part of the previously described investigation of the effect of CF synthesis in the MSRE, an experimental study is being made of the reaction of CF with fuel mixtures, both in the presence and in the absence of graphite. Since the formation of either elemental fluorine or CF in the MSRE would deplete the fuel mixture of fluoride ion, there would probably be at least a partial reduction of uranium tetrafluoride to uranium trifluoride. Accordingly, studies of the reaction rate of CF with a reduced fuel mixture have been emphasized.

Earlier reports on this program were confused somewhat by the lack of analytical confirmation of the extent of reduction in a reduced fuel (70-23-5-1-1 mole %) with zirconium metal turnings. In these tests, reductions corresponding to an analyzed 4 wt% of trivalent uranium in the molten fluoride mixture were maintained for long periods at 600 to 850°C in nickel containers, probably by virtue of excess solid reducing agent. The presence of UF3 in filtered samples from these melts was confirmed by petrographic observations and by X-ray diffraction data.

CF, Reactions in the Absence of Graphite. During one series of experiments, the reaction of CF with a melt containing UF3 was studied by recirculating a known mixture of CF in helium through a reduced mixture of LiF-BeF2-ZrF4-ThF4-UF4 (70-23-5-1-1 mole %, respectively) contained in nickel at temperatures of 700 to 850°C. Progress of the chemical reaction was followed by mass spectrographic analyses of gas samples periodically withdrawn from the reaction system.

An attempt was made to characterize the rate behavior of the reaction. Since concentrations of UF3 in the fluoride mixture were maintained at relatively high values (2 to 4 wt% as uranium metal), the reaction rate was assumed to be dependent only on the CF4 concentration. The reacting gas mixture (initially about 20% CF4 in helium) was recirculated through the system at a flow rate of about 1. 7 liters (STP) per minute. A total gas charge of about 3 liters (STP) was used in each experiment. For purposes of this evaluation, the loss of CF4 by the system was treated as a homogeneous, non-flow reaction. A fair correlation of the rate data with the first-order rate equation.

In order to deliver CF to the reaction site without prior exposure to the salt mixture, a hollow graphite cylinder was brazed to nickel. Tetrafluoride was admitted to the reaction system through this tube at very low flow rates, which were accurately controlled by a specially developed gas pump that utilized mercury displacement. The CF effused through the thin vertical wall of the cylinder.

When using helium at a known constant rate to sweep the gas space above the melt, the steady-state concentration of CF4 leaving in the gas swept from a nonreacting system can be calculated for any rate of CF4 input. Since the total gas flow rate leaving the system equaled the combined inlet flow rates of CF4 and helium in a chemically inert system, the concentration of CF4 in the gas phase (initially pure helium) above the melt at any time can be expressed by the equation.

Where N0 is the actual mole fraction of CF in helium at any time t, A is the steady-state mole fraction of CF for a chemically inert system with perfect mixing, a is the total moles in the gas space, and f is the total gas flow rate in moles per unit time. Mole fractions as a function of time were obtained from a calibrated recording thermal conductivity meter. From a plot of ANop/At as a function of Nor, the value of A was determined from values of the slope and intercept of a line drawn through the data points. In experiments on a nonreduced fuel-salt system, values of A calculated from the rate data agreed with the CF concentrations expected from flow rates to within +1 em of CF per hour. These results could be considered to demonstrate the precision of the experimental system and to imply that CF did not react with the nonreduced fuel mixture at a detectable rate.

The pure uranium trifluoride that was needed for the investigation of phase equilibria in MSRE-type fused salt systems was freshly prepared. Previously, batches of 0. 25 to 2. 25 kg of UF3 with a minimum purity of 95% solid-solid reaction is necessary for producing UF3 by this method. A rotating spherical reactor vessel, resembling a ball mill, was devised in an effort to ensure more efficient mixing and reaction than that obtained in the revolving cylinder used previously.

Xenon tetrafluoride crystals, suitable for X-ray diffraction and microscopic studies, were prepared by a procedure based on the work of a nickel reaction vessel. The vessel was connected to the fluorine gas manifold (described in the following section) and passivated with fluorine at a pressure of 45 psia and a temperature of 600°C. Then, 0. 42 g of xenon and 0. 24 g of fluorine (giving a volume ratio of 1:3) were admitted to the reaction vessel. The mixture, initially at 24 psia, was heated to a maximum temperature of 480°C, which was reached after 1 hr.

Cooled to -78°C, and the unreacted gases were pumped off. The condensate was then sublimed to a Pyrex U-tube. The yield, estimated to be approximately the theoretical amount, 600 mg, was a colorless, crystalline material. The frost-like crystals, sealed in the Pyrex U-tube, grew to a few millimeters in size in a few hours. These observations are in agreement with those of Claassen et al.

A manifold for regulating and controlling the flow of fluorine gas was built. Its principal uses have been to passivate gas-sampling capsules and other equipment needed in connection with the MSRE radiation effects tests (see Chap. 5, this report) and to furnish fluorine mixtures for various program needs. The unit consists of an arrangement of valves and gauges in a semi-enclosed panel located in a hood. A schematic diagram shows the structural material to Monel, nickel, and bronze. To assure leak tightness, all valve-to-tubing connections were silver-soldered, and the connectors used were of a special Hoke, Inc. , ultra-high vacuum type.

In order to determine the length of time and the temperature required for passivation of experimental equipment, the history and intended use of the equipment must be known. The size and shape of the equipment to be passivated are, in general, unimportant since a one-line connection is sufficient.

As discussed in Chapter 5 of this report, there has been experimental evidence that fluorine gas is evolved from solid, MSRE-type fused salts after in-pile exposure of the molten salt and during subsequent irradiation by beta and gamma rays from fission products. Because of the importance of any radiation decomposition of the fuel in molten-salt reactors, there is a need for further experimental information on the possible effects of beta and gamma rays.

Experiments for investigating the fluorine-generation effect with fast electrons from a Van de Graaff accelerator are being developed. These experiments have the immediate objective of establishing whether out-of-pile irradiation of a solid fused salt by beta or gamma rays, or both, will cause the evolution of fluorine in amounts sufficient to explain the amounts found after the in-pile tests described in Chapter 5. If significant amounts of fluorine release are obtained in these tests, other experiments will be run to evaluate the G values for F2 release as a function of several variables, including temperature, irradiation dose and dose rate, changes in the composition of fused salt, and crystal size in the salt.

An experimental investigation of the effect of beta energy with respect to fluorine generation in a simulated MSRE fuel mixture was initiated. Beta energy levels comparable to those from radioactive decay in the in-pile test capsules were attained by adding a carrier-free equilibrium mixture of Sr-90 as carbonates to the simulated fuel salt.

In a recent test, approximately 100 curies were added, as Sr, to 50 g of salt mixture. The resulting beta power of about 9. 4 x 10^18 eV/sec provided a power density comparable to that a few hours after shutdown in the in-pile test capsules. Based on an assumed G value of 0. 035 molecules of Fp per 100 eV, elemental fluorine could have been expected to be produced at a rate of about 10 mm per day, but inleakage of air interrupted the experiment.

The salt mixture had been melted and treated with anhydrous HF at 600°C to convert carbonates and oxides to soluble fluorides to ensure uniform dissolution. After helium sparging to remove residual HF, the salt was quenched to room temperature in a water bath. The system was monitored by determining changes in the pressure of the gas phase above the salt. When samples of this gas phase revealed the presence of air, the apparatus was disassembled for repairs. The effect of temperature will be studied in later tests if the yield of fluorine is significant.

Plans were made for irradiating INOR-8 capsules containing molten fluoride salts and graphite in an autoclave in a 10,000-curie (nominal) to be approximately 0. 85 x 10^8 eV/min-ml, giving a dose rate of 1. 1 x 10^7 W/g on the graphite specimens. The autoclave will be operated at temperatures of 600 to 650°C and absolute pressures of 1 to 2 atm and will be cooled to room temperature possibly every two to three weeks.

Twenty-four graphite spheres, 1/4 inch in diameter, will be held beneath the salt-vapor interface in the bottom of the 0. 06-inch-wall INOR-8 container. Two nickel tubes will lead to the outside of the source shield to valves for sampling and purging the vapor phase of.

The feasibility of studying several aspects of radiation decomposition by using X-rays as a source of energy is under study. Preliminary irradiations are in progress at room temperature on the fuel nickel chamber. The liberated gas will be collected in bulbs for analysis. The apparatus was carefully cleaned and prefluorinated prior to iodide; followed by determination of liberated iodine, appears to be a satisfactory method of analyzing for the expected amounts of fluorine.

An apparatus was constructed for use with a General Electric Company 250-kVp, 30-mA x-ray machine. The latest calibration of this machine indicated a reasonably uniform field with an intensity of 2500 r/min at 15 cm with light filtration. It was assumed that the effective photon energy was in the range of 60 to 80 keV when using a 250-kVp anode voltage. The calculated true mass absorption coefficients for the salt mixture assumed a G value of 0. 022 molecules of fluorine liberated per 100 eV absorbed; the expected fluorine generation rate would be 18 to 40 pg/hr for a 10-g sample of salt.

A ferrous sulfate dosimeter will be used for determining absolute G values. Measurements of the energy absorbed in the dosimeter solution, with and without salt in the irradiation chamber, will permit calculation of the energy absorbed in the salt. Subsequent irradiations will be made for determining the effects on fluorine generation of salt composition, effective photon energy, temperature, and impurity content.

The presence of fluorine in irradiated capsules, now believed to have resulted from the effects of radiation on the frozen salt, implied level and temperature. Graphite and the container material INOR-8 are not compatible with fluorine at elevated temperatures for long periods of time.

An experiment was performed to confirm this analysis and to determine at what temperature fluorine would begin to react rapidly. A was connected to the fluorine gas control unit (described in a preceding section of this chapter) and prefluorinated with fluorine at a pressure of 45 psia and a temperature of 600°C. The salt was added (360 g) to a depth of 3. 63 in. , and the capsule was again fluorinated using 1 atmosphere of fluorine at 600°C. Surprisingly, no absorption of fluorine was noted during this part of the treatment. Experience in the Laboratory's Chemical Technology Division has shown contrary behavior. Zirconium metal (0. 0988) was added to the salt and heated to 600°C under a helium atmosphere to accomplish partial reduction of the unit. Then the salt was allowed to cool to room temperature. The system was evacuated to 5 Hy, and 0. 002 moles of fluorine, which was the stoichiometric amount for reaction with the zirconium, was diluted to 1 atmosphere with helium and added to the capsule.

The frozen reduced salt was heated to 100°C in the presence of the mixed helium and fluorine gas. It was then cooled, and the gas pressure was noted. This procedure was repeated four times, with the upper temperature being increased 100°C each time. The data obtained, listed in Table 6. 4, show that the reaction was complete at 400°C, as far as pressure loss corresponding to the complete reaction of the fluorine was concerned. This temperature is approximately 42°C below the melting point.

A procedure for the dissolution of the salt was established that yields a sulfate solution of the fluoride salt fuel that is essentially free of fluoride ions. The salt is dissolved in a mixture of boric, nitric, and sulfuric acids and heated until fumes of sulfur trioxide are evolved. Sufficient water is added to make a 1M solution of H2SO4. A period of approximately 3 hours is required to dissolve a 411 g portion of salt.

A hot-cell mockup was used to evaluate the polarographic method for the determination of uranium. Solutions that contain uranium in the concentration range 5 to 50 µg can be measured directly by this method. The polarograms show the reduction of the uranyl ion in dilute mineral acids on a polarographic recorder. The uranium in the unknown is found by comparing the diffusion current of the unknown to diffusion currents of standard solutions of uranium and measuring the diffusion current of the unknown subsequently by a second measurement of the diffusion current after a standard addition has been made. With simulated hot-cell operation, a relative standard deviation of 2. 5% was obtained by the direct comparison method and 2% by the standard-addition method of determining uranium in non-irradiated salt solutions.

Zirconium: An amperometric method for the titration of zirconium with cupferron was developed for the determination of zirconium. An assembly that consists of a Harvard infusion pump and a 10-ml syringe with a specially designed titration cell was fabricated in order to adapt this method to remote manipulation. Zirconium forms a complex with cupferron in 1 M H2SO4; the concentration of this complex is measured electrically. The progress of the titration is followed by means of an ORNL polarograph (Model Q-1160) with the mercury pool at -0. 5 V respective to the platinum. The titration is continued until a sharp vertical inflection in the titration curve is observed.

When the MSRE fuel is dissolved in sulfuric acid, the titration of zirconium can be performed without any prior separations. It is not necessary to remove fluoride ions; chloride and nitrate ions interfere, however. When the method was carried out in the hot-cell mockup, a relative standard deviation of 1. 4% was obtained for determining zirconium in non-irradiated salt solutions.

Oxygen. Modifications were made to the apparatus for the determination of oxygen in fluorides by the inert-gas fusion procedure. The primary objective of the modification was to achieve higher temperatures than those ordinarily obtainable with the induction furnace; that is, in excess of 2300°C, in order to melt UO2. Earlier attempts had shown that.

UO2 was not being reduced. With the modified apparatus, UO2 is reduced to UC2 and UC, as confirmed by X-ray analysis. If platinum metal is added to powdered UO2 within the capsule, it is not necessary to reach the maximum temperature to obtain reduction of the UO.

The induction coil, which now consists of a five-turn, gold-plated coil, was extended vertically into the quartz envelope. Entry is made through a large Pyrex ground joint. The opening around the tubes was sealed with epoxy cement. The use of the glass joint and the epoxy seal is possible because this area is not in the heated zone. Two hemispherical heat shields of tantalum metal surround the working coil and serve to protect the quartz envelope from radiated heat. The use of the small coil within the quartz jacket increases the coupling to the graphite crucible and consequently the temperature. With the assurance that the apparatus is now capable of reducing UO2, efforts are being made to determine the replication of data from test samples.

The following in-cell equipment was fabricated and satisfactorily tested in the mockup cell: reducing normality apparatus; coulometric cell for the determination of uranium (a primary method); polarographic cell for the determination of uranium (a secondary method); amperometric titration cell for the determination of zirconium (a primary method). Preliminary tests were made on the pyrolytic apparatus for the determination of fluorides (a primary method) and the filter photometer for the determination of iron, nickel, and chromium (secondary methods).

Design work on a chemical plant proposed for use in conjunction with the MSRE was essentially completed. Sixty drawings were prepared that cover piping, structure, electrical facilities, and instrumentation. The processing cell will contain the fuel storage tank (processing tank), a sodium fluoride trap for decontamination, a caustic scrubber for iodine and tellurium removal, and the fluorine disposal system in which the fluorine will be reacted with SO2. The spare cell east of the fuel-processing cell will contain the offgas filter and the hydrogen flame arrester. Lines will be provided to this cell for future disposal of waste salt.

The area above the fuel-processing cell will be the operating area for the facility and will contain the instrument panel board, instrument cubicle for containment of instruments connected directly to the process, UFe absorber cubicle, salt sampler, and salt-charging station. The hydrogen, SO2, HF, and fluorine supplies and the metering equipment will be located southwest of the plant outside Building 7503.

The flowsheet was changed slightly from that shown in the previous report. Since most of the iodine and tellurium will be evolved during fluorination, the exit gas from the fluorine disposal system was routed through the caustic scrubber. Instead of collecting and sampling the HFH2O stream, a portion of the stream will be sent through a continuous analyzer. A salt sampler was added to the fuel storage tank for checking the progress of both fluorination and hydrofluorination.
