This is the most extensive discussion of liquid-metal fuel reactor development yet published in the United States. Emphasis has been placed on the Liquid Metal Fuel Reactor being developed by Brookhaven National Laboratory and Babcock & Wilcox Co. because it is the most advanced project. The editor would like to have given more coverage to work at the last three locations but was unable to because time was lacking.

The liquid-metal fuel reactor development at Brookhaven started as an organized program in 1951. Before that, work had been conducted on bismuth-uranium fuel and other components. In 1954, Babcock & Wilcox Co. , in collaboration with representatives of sixteen other companies, prepared a reference design and report. In 1956, Babcock & Wilcox contracted with the Atomic Energy Commission to design, build, and operate a low-power experimental reactor (LMFR Experiment No. 1). Research, development, and design studies are being carried on concurrently by B & W and Brookhaven. LMFR Experiment No. 1, on which construction is scheduled to start in 1960, is intended to demonstrate feasibility and provide information on the physics, metallurgy, chemistry, and mechanical aspects of this type of reactor.

Liquid metal fuel reactors have received attention since the early days of reactor technology. The concept of a high-temperature fluid fuel, which could be circulated for both heat exchange and chemical processing, has been an intriguing one.

This type of reactor was first suggested in 1941 but received little research and development attention until approximately 1947. At this time, the Nuclear Engineering Department at Brookhaven National Laboratory began its Liquid Metal Fuel Reactor (LMFR) development. A solution of uranium in bismuth was suggested because of the low melting point and low neutron-capture cross-section of bismuth. Coupled with these factors is the very high boiling point of bismuth, which makes possible the high-temperature operation of a bismuth-cooled reactor at relatively low.

Modern steam power plants have a thermodynamic efficiency of approximately 40%. For a nuclear system to achieve comparable efficiencies, the working fluid will have to have a reactor outlet temperature in the neighborhood of 500°C. The LMFR is one of the new types of nuclear reactors having this desirable characteristic. Thus, it is one of the few with potentialities for producing power competitive with the best of the present steam.

Work at Brookhaven National Laboratory. In 1948, an appraisal of various low-melting alloys was made at Brookhaven. Attention was also given to metallic slurries consisting of uranium in the form of intermetallic compounds suspended in liquid metal carriers. The uranium-bismuth system appeared to show considerable promise. Preliminary solubility studies were completed by 1950, and a start was made on fuel processing.

Since that time, the project has steadily accelerated. Chemical aspects of the fuel and fuel-processing systems have been and are being investigated in considerable detail. Metallurgical studies of corrosion, mass transfer, and stability of fuel systems have advanced from short-time crucible tests to circulating loops of alloy steel operated for many thousands of hours. Consideration has also been given to the design of various reactor components such as pumps, piping, valves, heat exchangers, and instruments.

The LMFR has been evaluated from time to time as part of the general Atomic Energy Commission Reactor Development Program. During the summer of 1953, the LMFR was evaluated under Project Dynamo, and it was concluded that it was an extremely attractive concept if proven technically feasible. In 1957, the Babcock & Wilcox Company re-evaluated the LMFR and found the outlook as good as indicated previously. Of course, the development of a new reactor concept of this kind is a long-range program.

18-2. 1 Comparison of fluid- and solid-fuel reactors.

Simple structure. A fluid fuel can be cooled in an external heat exchanger separate from the reactor core. Thus, the nuclear requirements (of the core) and the heat flow requirements (of the exchanger) need not both be satisfied at the same place. This may allow design for very high specific power.

Simplified reprocessing: The reduction to metal, fabrication, canning, and dissolving steps are eliminated. Because manual steps in refabrication are unnecessary, decontamination need not be complete. The cooling time could be made much shorter, resulting in a smaller holdup of fissionable.

Inherent safety and ease of control are key characteristics of the discussed liquid fuel. Any liquid fuel that expands upon heating exhibits an immediate negative temperature coefficient of reactivity. This effect occurs without delays from heat transfer processes. The expansion rate is solely constrained by the speed of sound (shockwave) in the liquid. This instantaneous impact contributes to the self-regulating nature of the reactor. Furthermore, modifying fuel concentration serves as an effective method for operational control.

As a solvent for liquid-metal fuels, bismuth is a natural choice because it dissolves uranium and has a low cross-section for thermal neutrons. As a result, research work at Brookhaven National Laboratory has centered on bismuth-uranium fuels. Other possible liquid-metal fuels are the Los uranium oxide in liquid metals, NaK, or bismuth. The limited solubility of uranium in bismuth is troublesome in some designs. More concentrated fuels can be obtained by using slurries or dispersions of solid uranium compounds in bismuth. Among the solids which have been suggested are intermetallic compounds, uranium oxide, uranium carbide, and uranium fluoride. Use of a dispersion avoids the limited concentration but introduces other problems of concentration control, stability, and erosion.

The uranium-bismuth fuel system is flexible and can be used in many designs. Although other types of liquid-metal systems are certainly possible, the LMFR at Brookhaven is being designed as a thermal reactor in which the fuel is dissolved or suspended in a liquid heavy-metal carrier. Ordinarily, the liquid metal is bismuth for the highest neutron economy, but other systems such as lead or lead-bismuth eutectic may be used. The moderator is graphite; although beryllium oxide has also been considered.

Liquid metal fuel reactors are classified based on their heat transfer characteristics. If heat is transferred within the core, the reactor is internally cooled. The term "integral reactor" implies an externally cooled system but one so compact that the reactor and primary heat exchangers can be placed in the same container.

Externally cooled LMFRs can be divided into two classes: single-fluid and two-fluid. In the single-fluid reactor, the fissionable and fertile materials are combined in a single fluid carrier, bismuth. This type of reactor has no separate blanket, and conversion or breeding takes place within the core fluid itself. The conversion ratio can be made to approach unity with the proper choice of such parameters as core size, graphite-to-fuel ratio, and thorium concentration. However, the most economic design is not necessarily the one having the highest conversion ratio (see Chapter 24). If no fertile material is mixed with the fuel, the concept reduces to the simple.

The two-fluid externally cooled LMFR (-2) is somewhat more complex because it has a physically separate core and blanket, but higher conversion ratios are possible. The blanket can be made in a variety of ways, making use of either solid or liquid blanket materials. In exploiting the LMFR concept to the full, a fluid blanket consisting of a slurry of ThBie or ThOg in bismuth is used.

Therefore, solutions for fuels are possible. Such a fuel for the single-region reactors is possible only for small thorium loadings or for burners. Higher fuel concentrations can be utilized only through the use of slurries. On the basis of experiments, a maximum slurry content of 10 wt% (weight percent) of either uranium or thorium as bismuthide compounds in bismuth can be assumed. If an oxide slurry is used, approximately 20 wt% can be carried by the bismuth. So far only fuels of U33 and U4 have been investigated in the LMFR program.

In the following chapters, detailed discussions of the liquid metal fuels research, development, and engineering work are given. Practically all the LMFR work is in the research and development stage. In the first group of chapters, the physics, chemistry, and engineering design of the LMER are discussed. It should be understood that these are design studies, and it is expected that more than one liquid metal fuel experimental reactor will have to be built and operated before a final commercial design is evolved.

The flexibility of liquid metal fuel systems is such that they range over several different reactor categories. Liquid metal reactors may be designed as fast, intermediate, or thermal systems, with either circulating or static fuel systems. The reactor core components consist of a fuel carrier such as molten bismuth or lead and a moderator such as graphite or beryllium if the neutrons within the reactor core are to be thermalized. If the fuel is stationary, a second fluid is required as the reactor coolant.

In the simplest system, a high-temperature liquid-metal solution or slurry would be pumped through an externally moderated reactor core. For such a reactor, the neutron physics problems would be similar to those of aqueous homogeneous systems. The chief difference would lie in the neutron spectrum, which would be higher because of weaker moderation and higher operating temperatures.

The liquid-metal system that has received the greatest emphasis to date is of the heterogeneous, circulating fuel type. This reactor, known as the Liquid Metal Fuel Reactor (LMFR), has as its fuel a dilute solution of enriched uranium in liquid bismuth, and graphite is used as both moderator and reflector. With U33 as the fuel and Th2 as the fertile material, the reactor can be designed as a thermal breeder. Consideration is restricted here to this reactor type, but wherever possible, information of a general nature is included.

Cross sections. Most of the cross sections required for neutron physics studies of the LMFR can be obtained from BNL-325. The following exceptions should be noted. The 2200 m/s value of the absorption, however, is 3.6 mb. After correcting for the presence of such impurities, an absorption cross section of about 4 mb, including impurities. Graphite of density 1. 8 g/cm³ or higher is becoming available, but the purity of this high-density graphite has not been well established.

Bismuth has prominent resonances at 810 eV and 2370 eV, largely due to scattering. Breit-Wigner parameters obtained by Bollinger et al. at Argonne National Laboratory are listed in Table 19-1. To determine neutron capture within these resonances, it is necessary to estimate the value of the level width, γ. One method is to use the value of 0.5 b obtained by Langsdorf (ANL-4342) for the resonance integral, which implies that γ is about 150 meV. An analysis of Bollinger's data indicates that a more likely value is about 50 meV.

High-energy cross sections of bismuth and lead are of secondary interest in well-moderated liquid-metal reactors but would become of prime interest in fast- or intermediate-energy reactors. On the basis of the known levels and spin assignments for bismuth and lead, Oleksa of Brookhaven National Laboratory has calculated cross sections that are in good agreement with experimental data. The (n, p) and (n, α) cross sections are negligible. The threshold for the (n, 2n) cross-section in bismuth is high.

Inelastic scattering in bismuth is important in considering fission-energy neutrons. The results of Oleksa's studies are presented in Table 19-2. For energies up to 2.6 MeV, Oleksa finds that the cross sections for scattering into the individual levels are in good agreement with calculations based.

In a U-fueled liquid-metal system, the cross sections of the higher isotopes of uranium are of considerable importance in determining equilibrium concentrations of these isotopes and the time required to approach their equilibrium. These equilibrium conditions require study because of solubility limitations in a liquid-metal fuel reactor. The chain starts with either U-235 or U-233, depending on whether a converter or breeder reactor is under consideration, and ends with U-237 because of its short half-life. In addition, some U-238 may be present in the fuel. Thermal cross sections are given in BNL-325.

Other absorption cross sections of importance to high-power, high-fuel burnup reactors are those of the long-lived fission products and, in a U8% breeder, that of Pa-233. Despite a number of comprehensive studies of these effects, accurate values may not be known until such reactors have been in operation for some time. Fuel-processing studies for the LMFR, however, indicate that the poisoning effect can be economically maintained.

Although the LMFR is a heterogeneous reactor, the fuel and moderator arrangements that have been proposed yield a core which is nearly homogeneous from the neutron physics viewpoint. The preferred core is an impermeable graphite structure perforated with holes of about 2 in. diameter for passage of the liquid-metal fuel. The moderator volume is about equal to that of the liquid metal, bismuth, which contains about 0. 1 w/o enriched uranium. Actually, the size of the fuel channels could be considerably increased without seriously increasing the flux disadvantage factor and hence the critical mass of the reactor core.

19-1. 3 Reactivity effects. A problem unique to circulating fuel reactors is the loss of delayed neutrons in the external circuit. Since the time spent by the delayed-neutron emitters outside the reactor core is generally greater than that spent within the core, a considerable fraction of the delayed neutrons may be wasted.

Coupled with this problem is the fact that the prompt temperature coefficient (due to liquid metal expansion) in the LMFR system under consideration is of the order of -5 x 10^-5/°C. Thus, ignoring temperature overshoots, which are discussed later, the magnitude of rapid reactivity changes must be limited to avoid large metal temperature changes. 5 x 10^7/°C, the delayed coefficient resulting primarily from increased neutron leakage due to the heating of the graphite structure.

1. 9 Breeding. The LMFR can be operated as a breeder on the U33-Th82 cycle. The possible breeding gain is not large, since the value of 0. 10 is about the maximum possible in a practical system. In fact, optimization based on economic considerations would probably reduce the gain to zero in any power breeder built in the near future. The gain is reduced by competitive neutron capture in the core and blanket and by neutron leakage from the blanket and from the ends of the reactor core. It is hoped that beryllium or an impermeable graphite will provide such a container for the LMFR. Croloy steel or tantalum containers about 1/4-inch thick appear satisfactory.

A number of studies on the so-called moderation principle have been conducted in an effort to decrease neutron losses to the container. By eliminating most of the moderator from a small area on both sides of the container wall, thermal neutron losses can be significantly decreased. The Babcock & Wilcox Company has developed several practical mechanical designs incorporating this principle.

Where 7 is the number of fast neutrons produced per thermal neutron captured in the fuel, and f is the thermal utilization factor. The product of the fast fission effect, €, and resonance escape probability, p, is assumed to be equal to unity.

In view of the uncertainty in the value of I for bismuth, the validity of neglecting resonance capture is still uncertain, and Monte Carlo studies are planned at BNL to obtain lower limits for ρ as a function of channel size and lattice pitch. For small channels, the homogeneous formula for f is adequate, since consideration of self-shielding of the fuel reduces f in a typical core by about 2%.

19-2. 3 Critical mass. The results of age-diffusion theory are in good agreement with multigroup calculations for predominantly thermal LMFR reactors. At higher fuel concentrations, however, the age theory overestimates the critical mass, as shown in Table 19-5. The differences in critical mass estimates are large only for weakly moderated reactors.

19-2. 4 Breeding. The conversion ratio obtainable in liquid metal systems depends on a number of variables, such as the fuel and fertile material concentrations, the fission-product processing methods, losses to the core container, etc. In a feasibility study of the LMFR conducted by the Babcock & Wilcox Company, currently practical reactor designs were reported (BAW-2) with conversion ratios ranging from 0. 8 to 0. The U/Bi atomic ratio was low (0. 6 x 10-3), and a 24% Cr-1% Mo steel core container was used, both.

19-2. 5 Control. Because of its prompt temperature coefficient, the LMER is expected to be stable. Nevertheless, it represents a completely new and untested system. There are a number of ways in which the reactivity of the system can change; for example, with changes in inlet temperature, concentration, or velocity of the fuel, and changes in xenon concentration, delayed neutron emitter concentration, and blanket composition. Most of these changes are expected to be gradual, but they can be sufficiently large to require the use of control rods. Inherent stability has not been demonstrated in operating reactors except over a limited range in reactivity and power output. In a reactor with a high-velocity coolant, there may occur sudden changes of reactivity which are too fast for conventional control. Thus, both inherent stability against sudden reactivity changes and control rods for large but gradual reactivity changes are needed until considerable experience has been gained in the operation of.

Studies have been carried out at BNL on control requirements for an LMFR experiment. , but also on conceivable emergency situations such as errors in fuel concentration control.

For a 5-MW experiment, control of 15% reactivity appears to be ample and can be obtained with four 24% Cr-1% Mo steel rods of about 2-inch diameter. Blacker rods containing boron could, of course, be used to increase reactivity control. A study of various arrangements of identical rods in a ring around a central rod indicates that the optimum position of the ring occurs at about 1/4 of the distance from the reactor center to the extrapolated radius of the reactor core.

It would be highly desirable to use sheaths for control rods in order to eliminate the problem of rod insertion through a heavy liquid metal. Steel sheaths are not satisfactory since they reduce the breeding ratio in a liquid-metal power breeder and decrease the overall thermal flux in an experimental reactor. The solution to the problem may lie in the development of structurally sound beryllium sheaths.

Calculations by K. Spinney at BNL indicate that even for a 5-MW experimental reactor, about 5. 5 ft of concrete is required as a neutron shield around the reactor cell. Gamma shielding of the cell requires about; therefore, it has been proposed that heavy concrete be used as the shield for the 5-MW reactor. For the rest of the circuit, including the degasser, pumps, heat exchanger, etc. , the advantage of using BNL concrete is.

A number of fundamental studies of the kinetics of circulating fuel, the equations governing the system, are linear and complicated, chiefly by the feedback of delayed neutrons. General results for the in-hour relation have been obtained by Fleck for U233- and U235-fueled reactors. At high power, the kinetics are much more complicated, and there is a real question whether the response of a complex reactor can be accurately predicted in advance of its operation. Bethe has strongly recommended the use of oscillator experiments to determine reactor transfer functions. Despite such experiments, however, the mechanism responsible for the resonances observed in EBR-I has, to date, not been satisfactorily explained.

Transients, the feedback of information through the external system being slow by comparison. The method, however, suffers from the defect that it cannot reveal instabilities associated with the entire circuit. The representation of the reactor, however, is generally oversimplified because of the complexity of the overall system.

Although the set of kinetic equations that include temperature effects is nonlinear, the linearized equations are satisfactory for the investigation of stability and the qualitative transient behavior. A large subset of equations is required to properly treat the effect of the delayed neutron emitters.

A study of the temperature-dependent open-loop kinetics of the LMFR has been carried out by Fleck. The effect of delayed neutrons and the delayed moderator temperature coefficient were neglected. Under these conditions, Fleck found that the reactor responded rapidly and with little overshoot in temperature when subjected to the largest permissible reactivity excursions.

Using a method developed at the Oak Ridge National Laboratory (ORNL-CF1-56-4-183) for homogeneous systems, the Babcock & Wilcox Company has studied the stability of the LMFR against small oscillations. The results show that the LMFR models under study are stable up to power densities 100 to 1000 times greater than the nominal design level.

Fleck has also examined the transient pressures in LMFR cores by treating the bismuth as a frictionless, compressible fluid. He found that the maximum pressures developed during conceivable transients were quite small.

In general, heterogeneous reactors possessing both a small prompt (positive or negative) fuel temperature coefficient and a large delayed negative moderator temperature coefficient can be expected to exhibit oscillatory instability at sufficiently high power. However, elementary models indicate that power levels high enough to cause such instability are not achievable in present reactors. Further study of the complex heat-transfer transients in reactor systems is still required before reactor stability can be assured.

In Chapter 18, the advantages and disadvantages of liquid metal fuels were discussed in a general way. The point was made that a liquid-metal fuel has no theoretical limitation of burnup, suffers no radiation damage, and is easily handled for fission-product poison removal. In this chapter, the results of research and development on various liquid-metal fuels are presented. This work has been largely concentrated on uranium dissolved.

At the contemplated operating temperatures of approximately 500°C, it was found that uranium has adequate solubility in bismuth when present by itself. However, as the work progressed, it soon became evident that other materials would have to be added to the solution in order to obtain a usable fuel. The present fuel system contains uranium as the fuel, zirconium as a corrosion inhibitor, and magnesium as an oxygen getter.

An LMFR operating on the contemplated Th8 to U33 breeding cycle can be designed with an initial U% concentration of 700 to 1000 ppm in bismuth. The actual figure, of course, is dependent upon the specific design and materials used. In Chapter 24, in the design studies, such figures are given. The concentrations of zirconium and magnesium are each approximately 300 ppm. It is contemplated that these concentrations will have to be varied depending upon desired operating conditions. In their use as a corrosion inhibitor and antioxidant, there is enough leeway for this.

The fuel described in the previous paragraph is the clean fuel, which would be charged initially. During reactor operation, however, fission products will build up in the fuel and would be maintained at a level dictated by the economics of the chemical reprocessing system used. It has been found that the fission products and other additives to the bismuth have an important effect on the solubility of uranium in bismuth. These have been carefully investigated in order to permit selection of reactor temperatures that will ensure that all the uranium remains in solution during reactor operation. Likewise, the solubility of steel corrosion products has been investigated to determine their effect on uranium solubility in bismuth.

It is important to note that although the basic fuel is a simple one, the uranium used for liquid metal fuel reactors using the Th-U%3 cycle must be almost completely enriched 233 or 235 in the initial charge. Further, since the concentrations are measured in parts per million by weight, it is not an easy matter to maintain a strict accounting of all fuel. When dealing with such small amounts, losses due to the reaction of uranium with carbon and adsorption of uranium on steel and graphite walls can be significant.

The fuel for the LMFR is still under extensive study. At present, most of the major information for the design of an LMFR experiment is at hand. This information is primarily solubility data and other fuel information presented in the following pages.

Workers have investigated the solubility of uranium and bismuth. Recently, with improvements in analytical techniques, redetermination of the solubility curve has been undertaken. The latest results are at variance with the older work of Bareis, as shown. It can be seen that the recent data obtained at Brookhaven National Laboratory are, at some temperatures, as much as 20 to 25% lower than those obtained some.

Other materials such as nickel, copper, manganese, etc. , in the bismuth in quantities large enough to affect the uranium solubility still remain to be investigated. For example, nickel has been shown to markedly reduce the uranium solubility in bismuth.

It is obvious that even slight variations in the solubility of uranium in bismuth might be of considerable importance in LMFR reactor design.

20-2. 2 Thorium and plutonium. The solubility of thorium in bismuth, as determined by Bryner, is compared with the solubility of uranium. In fact, it is so low that a breeding cycle using only thorium in solution with bismuth cannot be.

To fill out the information on fissionable fuel solubility in bismuth, Figure 3 shows the solubility of plutonium in bismuth as determined at the Los Alamos National Laboratory. In comparing plutonium with uranium, it is seen that plutonium is significantly more soluble.

In general, all the fission products are soluble enough so that they will stay in solution throughout the reactor cycle. This is not true of molybdenum, however. Attempts at determining the solubility of Mo have indicated that it is less than 1 ppm (the limit of detection) at temperatures below 800°C. Since a fair amount of the Mo is produced by fission, this means that a sludge might form during reactor operation.

20-2. 4 Magnesium and zirconium. The solubility of magnesium in bismuth in the temperature range 400 to 500°C is approximately 5 wt. %, which is considerably higher than the amounts of magnesium being considered in this work (300 ppm). Little work has been done on this particular determination at Brookhaven.

The solubility of zirconium in bismuth has been determined and is shown to be crucial.

20-2. 5 Solubility of corrosion products in bismuth. An alloy steel is contemplated as the tube material for containing the circulating fuel in the LMFR. Hence, it has been pertinent to determine the solubility of alloy steel constituents in bismuth. Figure 20-6 shows the solubilities of iron, chromium, nickel, and manganese, all of whose solubilities are fairly high from a corrosion point of view. Nickel and manganese are particularly.

20-2. 6 Solubilities of combinations of elements in bismuth. The effect of Zr on the U solubility. The mutual solubilities of uranium and zirconium in bismuth have been measured over the temperature range 325 to 700°C. The data are plotted in Figure 5. When bismuth is saturated with zirconium, the uranium solubility is appreciably decreased.

The effect of fission products on the solubility of U-Bi is significant. A good typical example is shown in Fig. 20-9, which illustrates that the solubility of uranium and bismuth is affected. There is little doubt that this small amount of fission products, 120 ppm, has a small but definite effect on uranium solubility.

Chromium has a marked effect on the solubility of iron, whereas the chromium solubility itself is not affected. An apparent solubility product is observed, as is shown in the line titled "Apparent solubility product. " Below 450°C, the iron solubility appears to be increased by saturating the solution with chromium. Above that temperature, the iron solubility is markedly reduced by chromium.

And fluoride salts. A typical chloride salt is the eutectic mixture of NaCl-KCl-MgCl2. It is important that none of the salts dissolve in the bismuth and get carried over into the core, since chlorine is a neutron poison. Preliminary investigations at BNL indicate that the solubility of these chloride salts is less than the detectable amount, 1 ppm.

20-3. 2 Solution properties. Little work has been done on determining physical properties of the solutions. The available results indicate that the small amount of dissolved material does not appreciably affect the physical properties of density, viscosity, heat capacity, and vapor pressure. For design purposes, the properties of pure bismuth can probably be used.

20-3. 3 Gas solubilities in bismuth. The question of the solubility of the fission-product gases xenon and krypton in bismuth is of extreme importance. In particular, Xe-135, a strong neutron poison, must be removed from the system as fast as it is formed in order to have a good neutron.

Attempts at measuring and calculating the solubility of these gases in bismuth have proved extremely difficult because of the extremely small solubilities. Mitra and Bonilla have measured the solubility of xenon in bismuth at 492°C as 8 x 10^-7 atom fraction at atmospheric pressure. On the other hand, McMillan has calculated the solubility as 10^7 atom fraction at 300°C. It is probable that the amount of gases produced in the reactor lies between these two determinations. At present, the question of xenon and krypton solubility in bismuth is open to more intensive.

Fuel has been prepared at BNL by simply dissolving the solid uranium, magnesium, and zirconium in molten bismuth. The solids are usually in the form of small chips and are placed in a small metal basket, which is then suspended in the bismuth.

Uranium in solution is protected by preventing its reaction with the steel and graphite of the system. Measurements have also been made of the rate of oxidation of uranium in the liquid fuel stream. This study indicates the effect of an accidental air leak during the reactor operation.

Losses of uranium from bismuth by reaction with container materials: Early attempts to make up uranium-bismuth solutions resulted in about a 50% loss of uranium, even though very high-purity bismuth by hydrogen firing, and adding 250 ppm Zr and 350 ppm Mg before the introduction of U reduced this loss to about 5%. It is possible that even this 5% loss may not be real but is attributable to analytical and sampling.

When the fuel solution is brought in contact with graphite, usually 10 to 15% of the uranium is lost from the solution. Apparently, it reacts with the graphite or impurities present in the graphite. Research on this is underway at present. However, it is proving to be extremely difficult since the amounts of materials involved are so small.

Reaction of fuel solution with air: Should an air leak occur in the LMFR, the uranium, magnesium, and zirconium will all tend to oxidize in preference to the bismuth. Figure 20-11 shows the results of an experiment in which air was bubbled through fuel kept at a temperature of 405°C. These results indicate that the preference of oxidation is in the order magnesium, uranium, zirconium.

The reaction data indicate that the uranium oxidation rate is one-half order dependent on the UO2 present. The magnesium oxidation rate, in general, is first order with respect to magnesium concentration. Other experiments show that if additional amounts of magnesium are added to the solution after the oxidation, most of the UO2 can be reduced back to uranium. These data are given in Table 20-1.

Work on fuel stability is obviously of great importance and is being continued. Very little has been done so far on the observation of stability under neutron bombardment. A program is getting underway for the study of radiation effects on the fuel concurrently with a study of corrosion effects. For this purpose, the Brookhaven Pile will be used together with Radiation Effects Loop No. 1.

Status of development: In developing a blanket system for the LMEFR, it has seemed logical to select one which is as similar as possible to the core fuel. After considerable evaluation, the principal emphasis has been placed upon a bismuth fluid containing thorium bismuthide in the form of very small particles. This is commonly called the thorium bismuthide slurry system.

Since this fluid has practically the same physical properties as that of the core, it would be possible to balance pressures across the graphite wall separating the blanket from the core; and in the event of mixing the core and blanket fluids, no violent reactions would ensue. Furthermore, from a chemical processing point of view, an all-metallic blanket system offers considerable advantages in pyrometallurgical processing techniques.

At the Ames Laboratory (Iowa State College), the solution of thorium in magnesium has received considerable attention in the past few years. This is a true solution and certainly offers another possibility for a blanket fluid. However, unless an absolute method for keeping the magnesium solution separate from the core bismuth solution is found, this system would be hazardous when used with the contemplated uranium-bismuth core fluid since magnesium and bismuth will react violently and cause a marked temperature rise.

Ordinarily, when thorium bismuthide is prepared at 500°C, very small equiaxed particles (less than 0. 5 microns) are formed.

When a 5 to 10 wt% thorium bismuthide slurry is cooled from a temperature of complete solution (above 1000°C), ThBiz precipitates in the form of platelets having diameter-to-thickness ratios greater than 50:1. The plane of the platelet is parallel to the 001 plane of the crystal. Platelet diameters up to 1 cm have been observed in alloys cooled at moderate rates. The diameters can be decreased by increasing the cooling rate.

Whereas equiaxed particles tend to grow equally in all three dimensions, it has been found that the platelets, when heated isothermally at temperatures above 300°C, tend to grow faster in thickness than in diameter. The solid particles thus tend to approach an equiaxed shape. The rate of approach to equiaxiality increases as the temperature of isothermic treatment is increased.

Considerable work has been carried out on the control of crystal structure and size. The addition of tolerable amounts of Li, Be, Mg, Al, Si, Ca, Ti, Nd, Ta, W, Pt, Pb, and U has little effect on the mode of thorium bismuthide when it is precipitated. The platelet mode of bismuthide precipitation is not modified by the addition of tellurium. The amount of tellurium used in these experiments has been 0. 10 w/o.

The mechanisms by which tellurium additions inhibit ThBiz particle growth, agglomeration, and deposition are as yet uncertain. Although additions of tellurium in larger concentrations decrease the solubility of thorium in bismuth markedly, the concentration of tellurium required for inhibition decreases the solubility only slightly. These small amounts of tellurium appear to be associated with the solid phase rather than the liquid phase. They do not appear to alter the crystal structure.

It has been observed that under certain conditions, the ThBiz particles suspended in liquid bismuth can be pressure-welded to one another and to container materials by the forces of impact. This pressure-welding phenomenon has been observed at 525°C and higher temperatures. Since this phenomenon might cause plugging by agglomeration at points of high impact, it will be necessary to take this factor into account in the design of slurry circulation systems.

20-6. 4 Thorium-bismuth slurry preparation. Dispersions of small equiaxed particles of ThBiz in bismuth can be prepared by heating finely divided thorium, in the form of powder or chips, in contact with liquid bismuth at 500 to 600°C under an inert atmosphere. The intermetallic compound is formed by an exothermic reaction at the thorium-bismuth interface when the convex radius of curvature of the thorium surface is suitably small. The compound exfoliates into the liquid as agglomerates of very small particles (less than 0. 5 micron). These small particles grow very rapidly, the larger at the expense of the smaller, as equiaxed single crystals of ThBiz. Rapid growth ceases when the maximum crystal dimensions approach approximately 50 to 60 microns. The time necessary for a complete reaction varies with the dimensions of the thorium. For example, 325-mesh thorium powder reacts completely in 5 min at 500°C and can be accelerated by raising the temperature. Higher temperatures; however, increase both the particle size and the tendency to form sintered agglomerates rather than single crystals.

If thorium powder is added to the liquid bismuth surface at the reaction temperature, it is necessary to stir the thorium into the liquid. Otherwise, a crust of intermetallic compound forms on the surface, which is rigid enough to support subsequent additions, thus preventing contact between the thorium and the bismuth.

A photomicrograph of a typical slurry produced by the exfoliation method is shown in Figure 12. The dark big particles appear in a white matrix of solidified bismuth. The method has been used to prepare 90-pound batches of slurry and may readily be adapted to tonnage-scale preparation. The method is suitable for preparation of the initial blanket charge but would probably not be used for slurry reconstitution during subsequent.

A modification of this method has been studied in which finely divided thorium from a supernatant mixture of fused chlorides is electrolytically deposited on a molten bismuth cathode at the desired temperature. The thorium must be stirred through the interface. Slurries that are satisfactory with respect to thorium content, particle size, and shape have been produced by the electrolytic method in batches of up to 10 lb. No evolution of gas has been detected during the thorium-bismuth reaction.

Another preparation method for thorium-bismuth slurry is by quenching and heat treatment. In this method, a solution of thorium, for example, 5 wt%, is very rapidly cooled from about 1000°C down to about 600°C. This can be accomplished by pouring a hot solution into a container having a sufficiently high heat capacity or by pouring the hot solution into an equal volume of liquid bismuth heated just above the melting point. When this is done, tiny platelets are formed.

As will be discussed in the following section, the platelet form of crystal is unsatisfactory from a fluidity point of view. When these fine platelets are heat-treated for 20 min at 800°C, or for 5 min at 900°C, dispersions of ThBie particles having maximum dimensions less than 100 microns and diameter-to-thickness ratios equal to or less than 5 to 1 are produced. Platelet formation during cooling is avoided by agitating the slurry to suspend the particles.

Figure 20-13 shows the fine platelets produced by the quenching, and Figure 14 shows the larger particles produced from these fine platelets by the heat treatment at 800°C for 20 min. Such a slurry exhibits high fluidity after concentration to 10 w/o thorium by removal of excess liquid phase and is suitable for use in the reactor blanket.

Other possible ways for reconstituting a satisfactory slurry after heating to complete the solution involve the use of ultrasonic energy. It has been demonstrated that the application of ultrasonic energy to a thorium-bismuth solution during cooling causes the formation of essentially equiaxed particles rather than platelets.

20-6. 5 Engineering studies of slurries. The intermetallic compound ThBig is quite soft, having a Rockwell 15-T hardness of approximately 60 at room temperature. The compound is pyrophoric and must be protected against oxidation.

The ideal slurry composition represents a balance between a desire for a high thermal neutron utilization factor (i. e. , a high thorium content) and the necessity for high fluidity. Fluidity studies have shown that the upper limit of thorium concentration for high fluidity at reactor temperatures is approximately 10 wt% of thorium. This corresponds to 24. 957. Although the viscosity of Th-Bi slurries has not been measured, calculations based on the viscosity of liquid bismuth and the behavior of similar systems indicate that at 550°C the viscosity of a 10 wt% Th suspension of 50-micron, equiaxed ThBig particles should be approximately 2. 5 centipoises. It has been observed that increasing the thorium content beyond 10 wt% Th causes a disproportionately large increase in the viscosity, so that the consistency approaches that of a mud or paste.

It has been observed in small systems that equiaxed ThB4C particles settle to a relatively stable layer in which the thorium concentration is approximately 15 wt% Th. Such layers can be redispersed by mild agitation of the supernatant liquid.

Slurry behavior under conditions of reactor blanket operation is anticipated. It is expected that the slurry would be contained in a low-permeability graphite within the reactor blanket. For heat removal and processing, the slurry would be circulated externally through pipes and heat exchangers fabricated of low-chromium steel or comparable material.

In the capsule experiments, small specimens of slurry are caused to flow back and forth at 6 cycles/min in periodically tilted tubes fabricated of the container material under test. The tubes, which are sealed under vacuum, are heated to a higher temperature at one end than at the other. Cr-1% Mo steel tubes; nearly all the ThBiz was deposited in the cooler ends of the tubes in less than 500 hr. Examination of the deposits disclosed that a deposit due to mass transfer of the steel had formed on the tube walls prior to deposition of the ThBiz.

Specimens of 5 wt% Th slurries have been cycled for 500 hr between 350 and 580°C in graphite tubes with no evidence of plug formation. In these experiments, a relatively rapid increase in ThBie particle size (from 50 to 225 microns in 500 hr) was observed. This increase was due to particle agglomeration rather than growth of single crystals. No evidence of graphite erosion was observed.

Specimens of slurries containing 10 wt% thorium and 0. 10 wt% tellurium have been cycled between 350 and 580°C in graphite and between 350 and 550°C in 24% Cr-1% Mo steel for 500 hours with no evidence of the plug formation or mass transfer of the steel. The specimens showed no increase in the maximum particle dimension and no particle agglomeration. When a specimen of slurry containing 10 wt% Th, 0.

Slurries containing up to 7 wt% Th and minor additions of zirconium have been circulated through small 24% Cr-1% Mo steel loops by means of a propeller pump. Isothermal circulation at 450°C has been carried out for more than 450 hours at velocities between 0. 3 and 1. 5 fps, with no difficulty in circulation or maintaining suspension. Attempts to circulate these slurries through a temperature differential, however, have resulted in the formation of ThBie deposits in the coldest section of the loop.

The problem of Th-Bi deposition during circulation through a temperature differential is one that must be solved before the Th-Bi slurry is acceptable as a fluid breeder-blanket material. The favorable results obtained by tellurium additions in the capsule experiments offer hope that the problem can be solved.

20-7. 1 Thorium oxide. Probably the best blanket material, next to the thorium bismuthide slurry, is the suspension of thorium oxide in bismuth. The thorium-oxide slurry should be compatible with the graphite and steel in the reactor structure. Experiments have shown that ThO₂ is wetted by the liquid bismuth if some zirconium or thorium is dissolved in the bismuth. Slurries of 10 w/o thorium oxide have been prepared.

With the mechanical properties and corrosion resistance of the materials of construction, a maximum temperature of 500°C or higher is deemed desirable for economically attractive operation of the reactor. No materials have yet been found that are mechanically strong at these temperatures, readily fabricable, and also completely resistant to corrosion.

This does not mean that there is no hope for obtaining good material for holding bismuth fuel. On the contrary, very significant advances have been made in the past few years. It must be realized that before work was started on liquid metal fuel reactors, very little was known about the solubility and corrosion characteristics of liquid bismuth with reference to containing materials. There is general optimism that continuing research and development will lead to suitable materials for containing the U-Bi.

The low-alloy steels offer a good compromise for use in the heat exchanger, piping, and reactor vessel, particularly since their corrosion resistance can be greatly improved by the addition to the fuel of Zr and Mg as corrosion inhibitors. Nickel-containing stainless steels cannot be used, despite their good high-temperature mechanical properties, because of the high solubility of Ni in Bi and the greatly lowered U solubility in the presence of this dissolved Ni. Radiation effects are currently being investigated.

Of course, besides steels, there are other materials, notably the rarer metals, which have characteristics making them suitable for certain uses in a liquid-metal system. However, unless the cost and ability to fabricate these materials can be improved significantly, heavy dependence will have to be placed upon alloy steels for the main containment problem.

21-1. 2 Graphite. In the LMFR, graphite is considered as the principal choice for the moderating material because of its availability, cost, and knowledge of its characteristics under radiation. However, there are additional special requirements for the graphite in the LMFR system. It not only is the moderator but is also the container material for the U-Bi solution in the reactor. Hence, it should be impervious to the liquid metal and mechanically strong.

Experimental work at BNL has shown that graphite can be used directly in contact with the fuel stream without the danger of corrosion. By preferentially reacting to form ZrC at the fuel-graphite interface, the Zr corrosion inhibitor also prevents the reaction of the U and fission products with the graphite. Special grades of graphite are being developed that appear to have the desired mechanical strength and low porosity required for use as a moderator and reflector in the reactor. Reactions of graphite with the fuel, and the possible effects of pile radiation on these reactions, are described in the following sections.

21-2. 1 Static tests. In order to tackle the steel corrosion problem in a basic manner, solubilities of the various components and combinations have been determined. Most of these solubilities are given in Chapter 20. However, more solubility work, important from a corrosion point of view, is discussed here.

Solubility of steel components and inhibiting additives in liquid Bi: Iron, Bi + 0. 1% Mg + saturation Zr are given. Uranium and Mg, in the quantities added, have no effect on the iron solubility over the temperature range 400 to 700°C. Zirconium increases iron solubility slightly at temperatures above 500°C. For example, Bi containing 1600 ppm Ti dissolved only 30% as much iron as pure Bi at 690°C, while Bi containing 300 ppm Ti (saturation) at 350°C dissolved more than ten times as much iron as pure Bi.

Miscellaneous data. The Fe-Zr intermetallic compound ZrFe₂ appears to decompose when added to Bi; Zr dissolves approximately to its normal saturation, and Fe somewhat in excess of its normal solubility in the presence of Zr. The amount of excess Fe present in the liquid metal can possibly be attributed to a finite solubility of the undissociated intermetallic compound ZrFe₂.

Surface reactions. Experimental evidence has shown that the corrosion resistance of steels in Bi is in part due to the formation of insoluble films on the steel surfaces. The effect of these films on the corrosion behavior of different steels is not readily determined by thermal convection loop experiments because of the relatively low temperatures (400 to 550°C) and long times associated with such tests.

The surfaces are cleaned and given various surface treatments, such as sandblasting, chemical etches, polishes, etc. Six to ten different materials are then placed in a vacuum furnace, heat-treated as desired, and immersed in a Bi alloy containing the desired additives. The crucible used to contain the liquid metal is either a material inert to Bi, such as Mo or graphite, or the same material as the specimen. After contacting, the samples are removed from the solution at temperature and allowed to cool in He or in vacuum. The adherent Bi is removed from the steel by immersing in Hg at 200°C in a vacuum or inert atmosphere. After rinsing, the residual adherent Hg is completely removed by vacuum distillation at 100 to 200°C. The cleaned surfaces are examined by X-ray reflection techniques, utilizing a North American Phillips High Angle Diffractometer.

Surface reaction of zirconium, titanium, and magnesium. When pure iron was contacted with bismuth containing radioactive zirconium tracer for 1 hr at 450°C, a Langmuir-type adsorption of the zirconium on the iron crucible surface was obtained. Increasing the temperature to 520°C and the contact time to as much as 24 hr showed an increased amount of reaction. The structure of this deposit is not known. On the other hand, when pure iron is contacted in saturated solutions of zirconium in bismuth, detectable surface deposits occur. At concentrations of zirconium below saturation value, pure iron is extensively attacked.

A tightly adherent, thick, uniform, metallic deposit was found on the surfaces of pure Fe dipsticks contacted with liquid Bi saturated with Ti at 650 to 790°C. In all cases, the X-ray patterns were the same but could not be identified. The 15- to 25-micron layers were carefully scraped off and chemically analyzed. The results corresponded to a compound having the composition FeTi₅Bi₂.

Pure Fe and 24% Cr-1% Mo steel samples contacted with 2. 5 w/o Mg in Bi at 700°C for 250 hr showed no deposit detectable by X-ray diffraction. Slight uniform intergranular attack was observed on all the samples. Pure Fe samples contacted with Bi solutions containing 0. 56% Mg did not have detectable surface films. These solutions acted similarly to those saturated with Zr.

Reactions of steels with UBi solutions. Uranium nitride (UN) deposits have been identified on the surfaces of 5% Cr-1/2% Mo, 24% Cr-1% Mo, Bessemer, and mild steels after these samples were contacted with Bi solutions containing U or U+Mg. Extensive attack always accompanied UN formation, indicating that this film is not protective.

Reactions of steels with Bi solutions containing combinations of Zr, Mg, U, Th, and Ti. No corrosion has ever occurred, nor have films other than ZrN or ZrC been found. When mild steel was contacted with Bi containing 1000 ppm Zr and 200 ppm Ti at 650°C, X-ray examination showed strong lines for TiN and a less intense pattern of TiC.

Considerable difficulty was experienced in establishing the correct unit cell dimension for the nitrides and carbides of Zr and Ti. Many different values may be found in the literature. The inconsistency in the data probably can be attributed to the existence of varying amounts of C, O, or N in the samples. Table 21-1 gives the parameters determined by a number of investigators. The values of "ao" used in this research were those given by Duwez and Odell. These compared favorably with the values found on test specimens, powdered compact samples, and ZrN prepared by heating Zr in purified N₂ at 1000°C for 20 hr.

A nondestructive X-ray method of measuring film thickness has been developed for this research. The X-rays pass through the film and are diffracted by the substrate back to a counter. The intensity is reduced by the absorption of the film. Unknown conditions of the substrate are eliminated by measuring the intensity of two orders of reflection or by measuring the intensity of a reflection using two different radiations. The method is accurate to about 20%.

Effect of steel composition and heat treatment: It has been found experimentally that some steels with very similar overall compositions behave quite differently in the same static corrosion tests. Films that form on these materials range from pure ZrN to pure ZrC. Table 21-2 gives typical analyses selected from the more than 100 steels run in static corrosion tests and identifies the surface films. After contacting, the only changes in analyses were found in the total nitrogen remaining and the amount of ester halogen-insoluble nitrogen (EHN) present in the steels. The only significant difference in analyses between nitride-formers and carbide-formers in Table 21-2 is found in the relative amounts of EHN. The carbide-formers have more than 50% of the total nitrogen combined as EHN, while the nitride-formers have only a few percent of the total nitrogen combined. At present, the relationship between the N, Al, Cr, and the Mo contents of the steels and their film-forming properties is not obvious. The same holds true for the.

To a first approximation, the corrosion resistance of a particular steel is enhanced by high inhibitor concentrations and/or the presence of insoluble adherent films formed on the steel surface. The first of these conditions is neither desirable nor practical in a solution-type fuel reactor because of the adverse effect of Zr on the U solubility. At present, work is being done to measure quantitatively the effects of different alloying constituents on the activities of N and C in steels. Consider the following.

If the products of the Zr activity in the Bi, with the activities of the N and C in the steel, are not sufficient to satisfy the respective equilibrium constants, the reactions will not occur, and the steel will not form ZrC or ZrN films. If the activity products are greater than the constants (Karo or Karn), the reactions will proceed until the activities are lowered to these values. The excess of N or C above these equilibrium values should be a measure of the driving force of reactions (21-1) and (21-2) to the right.

Solution rate tests. The solution rates of Fe into Bi, and Bi+ Zr and Mg, were measured in crucibles of a carbon steel, a 24% Cr-1% Mo, a 5% Cr-1/2% Mo, and an AISI type-410 steel. The crucible, Bi, and additives were equilibrated at 400 to 425°C; the temperature was rapidly raised to 600°C, and the concentration of Fe in solution measured as a function of time. Results are shown in Figure 2. No detectable dissolution of Fe from the carbon steel was measured in 44 hr at 610°C. These results are parallel to the thermal convection loop results and consistent with the film-formation studies in that the measured solution rates are inversely proportional to the ability and rate at which the steels form ZrN films. At present, no data are available on rates of solution.

Rates of Precipitation. The rate of precipitation of iron from bismuth in a pure iron steel crucible is very rapid. Iron precipitated from bismuth, saturated at 615°C, as rapidly as the temperature could be lowered to 425°C. The addition of Zr plus Mg to the liquid metal did not change the rapid precipitation of most of the iron from the bismuth under these same conditions but produced a marked delay in the precipitation of the last amount of iron in excess of equilibrium solubility. An apparently stable supersaturation ratio of 2. 0 was observed for more than 7 hr at 425°C in a pure iron crucible containing Bi+ 1000 ppm Mg + 500 ppm Zr and 1. 7. This phenomenon may be due to the ability of the formed surface deposits to poison the effectiveness of the iron surface as a nucleation promoter or catalyst, the different supersaturations observed being due to the relative abilities of a Zr—Fe intermetallic compound or of ZrN to promote nucleation of iron. This observed supersaturation suggests that mass transfer should be nearly eliminated in a circulating system in which the solubility ratio due to the temperature gradient does not exceed the measured "stable supersaturation at the cold-leg temperature.

Precipitation rate experiments made in AISI type-410 steel crucibles show that Zr and Mg stabilize Cr supersaturations of 2.0 to 3.0 for more than 24 hours. The measured supersaturations should therefore be due to the films present on the steel surfaces.

21-2. 2 Corrosion testing on steels. The research effort on materials for containment of the LMFR has been concerned mainly with low-alloy steels having constituents which have low solubilities in Bi, such as C, Cr, and Mo. Although the solubilities of Fe and Cr are only 28 and 80 ppm respectively at the intended maximum temperature of operation, severe corrosion and mass transfer are encountered when pure Bi or a U-Bi solution is circulated through a temperature differential in a steel loop. This results from the continuous solution of the pipe material in the hot portion of the system and subsequent precipitation from the supersaturated solution in the colder portions. Zirconium additions to U-Bi greatly reduce this corrosion and mass transfer.

The behavior of steels in U-Bi is studied in three types of tests. Thermal convection loops are used to test materials under dynamic conditions. In these, the fuel solution is continuously circulated through a temperature differential in a closed loop of a pipe. More than sixty such loops have now been run at BNL. The principal limitation in these tests is that the velocities obtained by thermal pumping are extremely low when compared with the LMFR design conditions.

Forced circulation loops are used to study materials under environments more closely approximating LMFR conditions. Three such loops are now in operation at BNL, and two more are under construction. A very large loop, about 25 x 10^6 watts of heat, is now under construction and is expected to go into operation late this year.

Static tests, as discussed previously, in which steels are isothermally immersed in high-temperature U~Bi containing various additives, are used to study their corrosion resistance and the inhibition process as a function of additive concentration and steel composition. Most of the tests have been performed on a 24% Cr-1% Mo steel (Table 21-3). However, some tests have also been made with higher Cr steels, 14% Cr-1/2% Mo, 1/2% Cr-1/2% Mo, and carbon steels.

Approximately 15 inches, and the total length of the loop is approximately 40 inches. With this configuration, the flow rate is approximately 0. 05 fps when Bi is circulated with a 100°C temperature differential. Radiographic inspection of the loop while in operation is periodically made to monitor it for corrosion at the hottest section and deposition at the coldest section. The inside of the steel pipe for the loop is either acid-cleaned or grit-blasted. The pipe is then cold-bent to the desired shape and welded at the "tee" by the inert-gas shielded-arc process.

The general procedure for running the loop is as follows: (1) Solid Bi is charged into the melt tank. (2) The entire system is leak-checked with a mass spectrometer. (3) The Bi is melted and introduced into the uniformly heated (550°C), fully insulated loop through a 35-micron AISI.

Type 410 stainless steel filter. Zr and Mg are introduced into the loop through the airlock. The Bi in the loop is sampled using a graphite sample extractor to check for additive concentration. Uranium is added if additive concentrations are as desired. The temperature differential is obtained by removing the insulation from the cold leg and starting the fans. The entire loop is radiographed every 750 hours. The liquid metal is sampled at regular intervals. After completion of the test, the entire loop is sectioned longitudinally and transversely for metallographic examination.

In Table 21-4, data from 29 thermal convection loop experiments at BNL are summarized. The first three loops were fabricated from 24% Cr-1% Mo steel pipe, and the U-Bi solution was not inhibited. Loops No. Loops No. 18 to 25 inclusive were fabricated from various types of steels, ranging from Bessemer to 18% Cr-8% Ni austenitic steels.

It can be seen from the first three tests that deposition in the cold legs of uninhibited loops after a few hundred hours is sufficient to stop flow. These tests show conclusively that uninhibited U-Bi solution causes serious mass transfer of this steel even at a temperature differential as low as 40°C. Metallographic examination of the hot legs of these loops showed a generalized intergranular attack.

The data from loops inhibited with 350 ppm of Mg and 250 to 350 ppm Zr (loops No. 4 to 17) show that mass transfer rate can be decreased considerably by the introduction of these additives. This effect is attributed to the formation of a ZrN film on the steel surface. The data demonstrate, however, that this film is not completely protective in 24% Cr-1% Mo steel system. Test No. 4 indicates that for a differential in the order of 90°C, the film was sufficiently protective to prevent corrosion or deposition. 24 Cr-1 Mo loop sections were joined with 5 Cr-1/2 Mo welding rod. This higher chromium material has lower resistance to inhibited U-Bi than the pipe, so that corrosion generally starts at these welds. Increasing the temperature of the hot leg seems to increase the rate of corrosion, as illustrated by the results of loops No. 5 to 9 inclusive, which were all tested at 100°C temperature differential.

Loop No. 10, which was normalized from 954°C and tempered at 732°C after welding, stood up poorly when compared with other tests. The heat-treating was done in an argon atmosphere, and no subsequent alteration was made to the surface left by the heat treatment. This heat treatment was thought, from some observations in the pumped loops, to improve corrosion resistance. It is believed that the poor results of test No. 10 are due to alteration of the surface during the heat treatment and not to the metallurgical structure of the steel. Loops No. 11 and 12 had Be and graphite inserts in the hot leg to study their effect on mass transfer and also the stability of U, Mg, and Zr concentrations. No detrimental effects on either have been observed.

Loop No. 15, made of a 24 Cr-1 Mo steel that was internally nitrided to a depth of 0. 015 inches, appears to be standing up much better than other 24 Cr-1 Mo loops tested at a 125°C temperature differential. The added nitrogen in the steel probably promoted the formation of the ZrN film. A slight loss in Zr has been observed in this test, but other additive concentrations have remained constant.

Results of tests No. 18 to 25 show that higher-alloyed steels are inferior to the carbon steels in inhibited U-Bi. Loop No. 18, fabricated from Bessemer carbon steel, showed exceptional resistance to U-Bi. Metallographic examination of this loop indicated no evidence of corrosion or deposition after 12,356 hours of operation at 135°C temperature differential. A medium carbon steel containing Ti, Rh-1081, also exhibited good resistance to U-Bi corrosion. The lower chromium steels, such as 1/2% Cr-1/2% Mo and 14% Cr-1/2% Mo (tests No. 20, 21, and 22), also seem to be standing up well to inhibited U-Bi. The testing of these steels will be increased.

Loops No. 26 to 29 were run to study the effectiveness of Th, Th + Zr, Ti + Mg, and Ca + Zr as inhibitors. It can be seen from these tests that these inhibitors were much inferior to Mg and Zr combinations. In tests No. 27 and 29, it was found that a slow but continuous loss of Zr, Th, and Ca occurred. Horsley also ran Bi loops containing Ca and Zr as inhibitors. He reported similarly that the loops plugged, and that Ca and Zr were lost from the melt. The results of loop No. 28 indicate that Mg and Ti provide some inhibition but are not nearly as effective as Mg and Zr. Metallographic examination of this loop shows that the corrosion was uniform and that most of the attack took place 4 to 6 in. downstream from the "tee," in an area which is normally somewhat lower in temperature than.

Metallographic examinations of 24% Cr-1% Mo loops inhibited by Mg and Zr show that corrosion starts in the form of a pit. After the pit has generally proceeded laterally on the pipe, widening the pit rather than deepening it. A typical pitted area formed by U-Zr-Mg-Bi in 24% Cr-1% Mo steel is shown in Figure 4. The attack is transgranular throughout the pitted area. Horsley reported intergranular attack at the bottom of pits formed in a similar steel by Zr-Ca-Bi. The protective film is possibly so thin that it can be identified only under ideal conditions.

21-2. 4 High-velocity tests. Although thermal convection loops are convenient for extensive corrosion testing under dynamic conditions, the velocity is not large enough to provide design data for actual operating conditions. These data must be obtained by operating loops in which the bismuth solution is pumped at considerably higher linear velocities through suitably designed test sections.

Attainment of higher flow velocities complicates corrosion testing methods. Large heat inputs are necessary to obtain temperature differentials comparable to those readily attained in thermal convection loops. Special equipment is required to measure flow; pumps must be designed leak-tight to maintain absolute system purity. The U-Bi must be prevented from freezing in the piping.

A third corrosion loop (loop G) uses a canned centrifugal pump to circulate the U-Bi, permitting flows up to 4. 8 gpm and velocities up to 14 fps to be attained. Engineering devices such as bellows-sealed valves and pressure transmitters are being tested in this loop, as well as materials for high-velocity corrosion resistance. Heating and cooling is the same as in HVL I and II. The loop is fabricated for the most part of 24% Cr-1% Mo.

While the basic material of construction of these loops is a Cr-Mo steel, test sections are usually made up of a variety of steels and weldments. All welds are made by the inert arc process. Cleaning, for the most part, is done by grit blasting.

Results obtained thus far with the pumped loops are shown in Table 21-5. In most cases, a run consists of a test on a particular test section rather than on the entire loop. The exception is Run 4 of HVL I, which was continued until the loop plugged, at which time the entire loop was dismantled and refabricated of 14% Cr-1/2% Mo steel. The film temperature reported is the calculated liquid-steel interface temperature. In all tests, Zr and Mg were used as inhibitors.

The purpose of Run 1 on HVL I was to study the effect of velocity on the material deposited in the cold portions of the system. It was felt that a high flow rate might dislodge the loose precipitated crystals and circulate them to the hot sections, where they would redissolve in preference to the pipe wall. The high-velocity section was placed at the region of the coldest bulk liquid. All test specimens were fabricated of 22% Cr-1% Mo steel, and welds were performed with a 5% Cr-1/2% Mo bare filler rod.

To test the effect of impact on the inhibiting film, a right-angle, high-velocity section was inserted in the hot leg of HVL J-Run 2. The section included an annealed and hardened 23% Cr-1% Mo steel specimen. All welds were made with 5% Cr-1/2% Mo bare filler rod.

This run was terminated after 1026 hours of AT operation, and samples were removed for metallographic examination. No corrosion was detected on the polished samples located in the furnace. No erosion or corrosion was observed on any of the graphite samples. Again, a very small amount of deposition was found in the cold section; this time between the pipe wall and the cold sample bushing inserts. Large pits, some about 1/2-inch in diameter and 1/8-inch deep, were found on the steel samples located on the exit side of a right-angle bend (-7). If vortexing of the fluid (therefore a locally increased velocity) is assumed to have occurred after the change of direction in the right-angle bend, then a condition for cavitation may have existed; i. e. , the static head at this point (7 psi gauge) may have been exceeded by the dynamic head.

Run 4 of HVL I was intended to test the inhibiting film under an increased temperature gradient (150°C) with the maximum temperature raised to 550°C. The test section consisted of samples of 23% Cr-1% Mo steel (both annealed and normalized and tempered), mild steel, and several grades of graphite. All welds were made with 5% Cr-1/2% Mo bare filler rod. This run was terminated after 2591 hr of operation because of extensive pitting in the hot section and plugging in the finned cooler section, as revealed by radiographs. Attempts to drain the loop completely were unsuccessful. Upon sectioning, localized masses of intermetallic compounds were found, which probably developed when the system was cooled. These formations did not redissolve on heating because of the lack of good mixing and were viscous enough to prevent the bismuth from draining.

The entire loop was sectioned and examined. A severe pit-type corrosion was found in the hot section's welds (-8), as well as parent material (-9) were grossly attacked. 24/7% Cr-1% Mo steel, in the normalized and tempered condition, was less corroded than the same material in the annealed condition. Carbon steel samples showed little or no attack. Corrosion occurred in crevices between the samples and pipe walls. The mass-transfer plugs occurred in the region of the coldest film temperature rather than the coldest bulk temperature. Velocity did not sweep away the deposited material, but rather, a plug of high density was produced.

Loop G-Run 1 had a hot-leg test section consisting of specimens of 24% Cr-1% Mo, 14% Cr-1/2% Mo, AISI type-410, and Bessemer steels, joined with welds made with 23% Cr-1% Mo, 14% Cr-1/2% Mo, 5% Cr-1/2% Mo, AISI type-410, and mild steel bare filler rods. This run was terminated after 938 hr of operation at a 75°C film gradient and a flow of 4 fps in the test section. Examination of the test section showed that welds made with a 5% Cr-1/2% Mo rod were severely attacked, while those made with a 22% Cr-1% Mo rod and a 14% Cr-1/2% Mo rod were not attacked. The only other corrosion observed in this run was some slight attack on welds and the base material of AISI type-410 steel. Cavitation pits were also observed on the pump impeller.

In these loops are specimens of 23% Cr-1% Mo and 14% Cr-1/2% Mo steels having various heat treatments; AISI type-410 and Bessemer steels; and welds made with 13% Cr-1/2% Mo, 24% Cr-1% Mo, 5% Cr-1/2% Mo, AISI type-410, and mild steel bare filler rods. No corrosion has been detected radiographically in the loop G test section after 2500 hr of operation. This precipitate was first observed after 1400 hr of operation but is still not serious after 4000 hr.

Pitting of welds made with 5% Cr-1/2% Mo rod and possible corrosion of a 22% Cr-1% Mo weld have been detected in Run 1 of HVL I. There was no radiographically detectable corrosion and little or no mass transfer. The temperature differential was then increased to 75°C bulk (522 to 427°C film). After 100 hr at this new differential, deposition in the cooler was observed. Pitting of the 5% Cr-1/2% Mo weld was detected after 2000 hr at the new differential. However, after a total of 7400 hr of temperature gradient operation, the amount of pitting and transferred material was not serious enough to stop loop operation.

The effect of velocity on corrosion and mass transfer is not apparent at this time. This is mainly due to a lack of tests in which velocity is the only variable. Correlation between the pump loops and thermal convection loops suggests that velocity has little effect on mass transfer other than on the type of plug formed, provided conditions for cavitation do not exist. However, results from tests now underway should definitely evaluate this.

21-2. 5 Rapid oxidation of 21% Cr-1% Mo steel. In a pumped Bi loop containing Mg+2Zr, the 24% Cr-1% Mo steel adjacent to a pinhole leak was found to be severely oxidized. The appearance of the oxide scale was very similar to that reported by Leslie and Fontana.

A test simulating a leak in a loop was made to study this phenomenon. A 24% Cr-1% Mo steel pipe was filled with Bi containing 1000 ppm U, 350 ppm Mg, and 250 ppm Zr. A 1/32-inch hole was drilled in the pipe below the Bi level. A patch of asbestos tape 2 inches in diameter was put over the hole. The tube was then heated to 594°C and pressurized to 5 psi to force out a small amount of Bi. The pressure was dropped as soon as some Bi had leaked out, and the tube was then heated at 594°C for 1025 hours. The appearance of the pipe underneath the asbestos tape patch and a cross-section of the oxidized area are shown in Figure 11. A complete oxidation through the pipe wall has occurred in the area adjacent to the leak.

Tests run at 738°C and 816°C in covered crucibles show that chemically pure Bi2O3 can promote rapid oxidation in 24% Cr-1% Mo, 14% Cr-1/2% Mo, and carbon steels. Tube tests and crucible tests are being continued to determine the minimum temperature at which rapid oxidation is a problem.

21-2. 6 Radiation effects on steels. Since steel will be in direct contact with the liquid U-Bi fuel, it is important to determine the effects of fission recoils and fast neutrons on the rate of corrosion or erosion. If corrosion inhibition is achieved by a layer of ZrN between the Bi and the steel, there is concern that fission recoil particles might destroy this film. Local heating, resulting from the stopping of the particles, may cause a differential expansion between the layer and the steel. Consequently, the layer may break away from the steel, leaving the surface exposed to Bi attack. On the other hand, neutrons should not be detrimental to a thin ZrN layer.

Effects of neutrons must also be determined on the mechanical properties of the steels at reactor temperatures. Radiation-induced increases in tensile strength and elastic modulus may not anneal out at LMFR operating temperatures. A decrease in the impact strength is not considered too probable at these temperatures, although the possibility must be.

To study the radiation effects on materials, a capsule test has been developed. The capsules, in which samples are inserted, in a highly enriched U-Bi solution containing Mg and Zr inhibitors, are exposed in the BNL reactor and irradiated to the desired level. The test has the advantage of attaining high temperatures (700°C) and a high fission recoil density.

Dynamic tests of the reaction between Bi and steel in the presence of a radiation field must be completed before a final selection can be made of materials for the LMFR. The effect of velocity on corrosion is not certain from the out-of-pile studies, so that no exact analogy can be made between out-of-pile forced circulation loops and in-pile capsules. These loops had no U but did contain Ca and Zr inhibitors. The data suggest that pile radiation may have induced some acceleration of mass transfer.

An in-pile, forced-circulation loop has been built at BNL, and two others at Babcock & Wilcox Research Laboratory to test the corrosion stability of LMFR materials under conditions to be expected in the reactor experiment. In this loop, Bi containing approximately 1500 ppm of U5, 180 ppm Zr, and 350 ppm Mg will be pumped at a rate of 5 to 7 gpm. The bulk AT will be approximately 75°C, with a maximum temperature of 500°C. There are three sample sections in the loop: one containing samples of 14% Cr-1/2% Mo steel, 24% Cr-1% Mo steel, Be, and graphite, will be at the center of the reactor and will be in a flux of approximately 3 x 10^ thermal neutrons. This test is presently being assembled and will be operating late in 1958.

Several nonferrous metals are receiving attention as container materials, principally because of their low solubility in bismuth. At this time, only a small amount of work has been done on testing these metals. The following is a brief discussion of some of the most important of them.

In the Liquid Metals Handbook, beryllium has been reported to have good resistance to attack by liquid bismuth at 500°C and probably also at 1000°C. Recent advances in the production technology of beryllium metal have improved its mechanical properties sufficiently so that it is now possible to consider this metal for reactor core vessel or moderator. However, no data on the reaction between beryllium and uranium additives and fission products dissolved in a liquid metal fuel are available. Since uranium is known to form a stable intermetallic compound with beryllium, the possibility of such a reaction must be investigated before beryllium can be recommended as a moderator in contact with a liquid-metal fuel. Static tests on the resistance of Be to attack by U-Bi at 550 and 650°C showed some (but not conclusive) evidence of a slight attack (less than 1 mil/yr average penetration). A slight attack on Be was noted by Brasunas by a 2% U-Bi alloy after 4 hr at 1000°C.

21-3. 2 Tantalum. Recent work at the Ames Laboratory indicates that tantalum is an excellent material to contain U-Bi. A 5 wt% U in Bi solution rate of 800 lb/min. The U-Bi was circulated with an electromagnetic pump, and the temperature differential was 100°C (950 to 850°C).

Liquid metal samples taken during operation showed that the Ta concentration never exceeded 6 ppm. After 5250 hours of operation, the loop was shut down and examined metallographically. No transferred material was detected in the cold leg, and the corrosion was less than 1 mil. The tantalum remained shiny and ductile throughout the experiment.

Some success has been obtained; however, with Mo applied as a coating on low-chrome steel. The process was developed by the Vitro Corporation and is described in detail in KLX-10009. Essentially, the coating is applied by first electrophoretically depositing 80% Mo + 20% MoOs on the steel. The coating is then pressed, reduced in a H₂ atmosphere, repressed, and sintered in an H₂ + HCl atmosphere.

These specimens have been subjected to static Bi, which was temperature-cycled at 550 to 400°C. Filtered liquid metal samples of the Bi were taken and analyzed for the presence of Fe and Cr. The Bi was allowed to stay at the 550°C temperature overnight before a liquid metal sample was taken. After 4300 hr at temperature and some 17,000 cycles, the concentration of Fe was 6. 9 ppm, and Cr was 2 ppm. By comparison, the solubilities of Fe and Cr at 550°C were 30 ppm and 80 ppm, respectively.

On the basis of their low solubility in U-Bi, such materials as tungsten, tantalum, molybdenum, and beryllium could be classified as container materials. Their practical use, however, is governed by their poor air oxidation resistance, fabrication difficulties, availability, and cost.

The test apparatus consists of a main test chamber and a sump tank to facilitate easy handling of the liquid Bi and to permit periodic sampling of the liquid metal. The main test chamber, containing the samples and the sample loading mechanism, is shown in the cutaway of -12. The method of transmitting the load with air pistons through flexible bellows can be clearly seen.

A test consists of contacting the rotating cylindrical specimen with a flat specimen under a constant force for a set period of time under set conditions. After the contact run, the Bi is removed from the specimen. The degree and kind of scoring, galling, material transfer, and depth of wear on the surface were noted. Surface roughness measurements are made with a profilometer. Coefficients of friction are calculated from the measured torque data by the equation.

In general, the hard-to-hard material combinations have shown good wear resistance except for some scoring. The best hard material tested thus far is Al2O3 flame-coated on AISI 4130 steel. When this material was contacted against itself, no wear or scoring could be detected.

The material will be thermally cycled and exposed to inhibited U-Bi for long times to evaluate its utility. Stellite 90 and Rex AA also behaved well. Contacts made with common die steels and low-alloy steels have exhibited severe scoring and wear. Corrosion has also been detected on these samples. Of the cemented carbides, only TiC with either a mild steel or 24% Cr-1% Mo binder has been tested. This material did not show good wear properties and also exhibited some pitting corrosion.

Graphitar versus tool steel and Mo versus Rex AA or Stellite 90 have shown the best results of the hard versus soft combinations tested. The results have been good in that the wear has been very smooth; however, the wear has been excessive. The use of these combinations would be limited to very low-load applications.

In earlier chapters, it was pointed out that one of the chief advantages of the LMFR lies in the possibility of easy chemical processing. Several processing techniques have been studied, most of which are based on pyrometallurgical processes. The two chief pyrometallurgical methods under consideration are the chloride process, in which the bismuth fuel is contacted with a ternary mixture of molten chloride salts, and the fluoride process, in which the bismuth fuel is contacted with molten fluoride salts containing hydrogen fluoride. As may be imagined, the construction material problem for these plants is very difficult.

In the rocking furnace test, a piece of tubing approximately 12 in. long and 1/2 in. ID, containing a charge of either salt or a mixture of salt and bismuth, is placed on a rocking rack in a furnace. This rack alternately tilts to one end for a period of 1 min and then to the other end for a like amount of time. The two ends of the furnace are kept at 450 and 500°C in order to give a temperature differential and thus induce mass-transfer corrosion. The standard test period has been 1000 hr. These tests are part of the initial screening program. When they are completed, the metals which have given the best performance will be further evaluated in test loops and pilot-plant equipment.

At present, only molybdenum has been satisfactorily tested against a mixture of salt and bismuth fuel. However, the results are definitely encouraging. It has been found that the ternary salt, MgCl2-NaCl-KCl, with or without zirconium and uranium chlorides, can be contained fairly well in austenitic stainless steels, particularly 347 stainless steel.

A mixture of bismuth fuel and the ternary salt containing less than 1% BiCl3 was tested; the ferritic stainless steels were the best materials. These include 410, 430, and 446 stainless steels. Probably the best of the ferritics is the 23% Cr-1% Mo stainless steel.

During one step in the chloride chemical process, it is necessary to have the ternary salt containing more than 1% BiCls in contact with bismuth fuel. For this mixture, only molybdenum has been satisfactory; however, considerably more testing is required before this can be considered.

The experience in handling salt with larger-sized equipment is quite limited. A small loop built of 347 stainless steel has been operated satisfactorily for a fairly short time. A much larger loop, loop "N," is now being constructed at BNL. This will contact the chloride salt and the bismuth fuel. The salt part of the loop is constructed of 347 stainless steel. The bismuth fuel section of the unit is constructed of 24% Cr-1% Mo steel. The actual contacting units are constructed of both 347 and the low-chrome steels. This pilot plant, when placed in operation, should furnish considerable information on the corrosion characteristics of the molten chloride salt.

The fluoride process also presents difficulties with materials of construction. The mixture of the molten fluoride salts containing HF with the bismuth fuel is extremely corrosive. Pure nickel has been found to stand up fairly well to the molten fluoride salts alone. However, the combination of the three materials has proved to be very corrosive, even to nickel.

21-6. 1 Mechanical properties. In the proposed LMFR system, the moderator, graphite, is also employed as the container material. Therefore, the graphite should have good physical properties such as strength, hardness, and resistance to shock. Since graphite is to be the container material for the bismuth solution, it should theoretically be completely impervious to the solution. For this reason, special graphites, more impervious than the usual reactor grades, have been developed and are under development. Physical properties of typical examples of these graphites are given in Table 21-6.

Another special requirement for the graphite is that it withstand erosion or pitting by the flowing fuel. Test sections of accurately bored graphite were placed in test loops where the flow velocity of bismuth was 6 to 8 fps. No observable effect was noted after 1000 hours of testing at 550°C.

Although tests so far have been on rather small samples, the mechanical properties of these improved graphites appear sufficiently good for use in LMFR systems. These new graphites must be manufactured in large sizes in order to conveniently make up the core of an LMFR. The graphite industry in the United States is now developing manufacturing techniques for making such large sizes.

21-6. 2 Graphite-to-metal seals. Leak-tight joints of steel to graphite are required at several places in the core of an LMFR. These seals must withstand an average of 125 psi at approximately 550°C. This is done by joining finely machined steel and graphite surfaces under sufficient spring loading to prevent bismuth leaking across the seal.

Tests were run by Markert at the Babcock & Wilcox Research Center to evaluate such pressure seals. Three-inch and six-inch steel pipes (24% Cr-1% Mo) with machined ends were pressed against a flat surface. The graphite surface had been prepared by sanding and polishing with No. 000 emery paper. A seal was effected against Bi at 438°C with a pressure differential across the seal of 100 psi and with 1500 psi stress between the graphite and the steel. It was not necessary to resort to complicated interface configurations to obtain a seal. These initial results are very encouraging, and further development work is being directed toward more complicated seals.

21-6. 3 Graphite reactions. If graphite is to be in direct contact with the U-Bi fuel, it should be inert to the various fuel constituents and also to fission products and corrosion products. Work has been done at various locations on these reactions. Thermodynamic data on chemical equilibrium, when available, have proved to be extremely valuable in guiding.

Uranium-graphite reactions. The reaction between uranium and graphite is probably the most important one to consider in the LMFR. Mallett, Gerds, and Nelson reported that uranium forms three stable carbides: UC, UCe, and U2Cs. Further work on this subject indicates that when less than 1% U is present in bismuth, it does not react with graphite to form carbides at temperatures below 1200°C.

The predictability from the chemical thermodynamic data is evident. An experiment wherein graphite was exposed to 1000 ppm U, 50 ppm Zr, and 300 ppm Mg in Bi at 1000°C for 8 hours revealed solely a single intense x-ray diffraction line aligning with the most intense line for ZrC. The x-ray analysis occurred subsequent to the removal of the adherent bismuth from the samples through mercury rinsing.

Zirconium and titanium reactions with graphite. Since zirconium and possibly some titanium will be present in the bismuth, reactions of these materials with graphite have been investigated. As described above, zirconium reacts to form the carbide with a strong negative free energy. At temperatures around 550°C, ZrC and solid solutions of ZrC and ZrN have been identified on graphite surfaces contacted with bismuth solutions containing 130 ppm Zr.

On the other hand, no reaction between graphite and 1600 ppm Ti in Bi solutions has been observed up to 800°C for contact times up to 170 hr. A strong TiC x-ray pattern and a less intense ZrC-ZrN solution pattern were observed on graphite contacted with approximately 0. 2% Ti.

When steel samples are reacted with U-Bi fuels containing zirconium and magnesium, the X-ray patterns of the surface are those for pure or very nearly pure nitrides or carbides. When graphite is contacted with the fuel, however, solid solutions of the carbide and nitride are often found. Parameters are low for complete carbon carbide structures.

Parameters for carbon-deficient carbide structures have been reported in the literature. For ZrC, the reported a₀ varied from 4. 376 Å at 20 atomic percent C to 4. 67 Å at 50 atomic percent C. However, up to the present time, no evidence of carbon-deficient structures has been observed in studying the graphite-fuel experiments. The low parameters are instead believed to be due to nitrogen replacing the carbon atoms in the carbide lattice (NaCl-type). Parameters for such solid carbide-nitride solutions are described by Duwez and Odell.

Fission product-graphite reactions. The products of uranium fission may also react chemically with graphite to form carbides. A series of experiments have shown that materials such as cerium will definitely react with graphite. When 25 ppm Ce in bismuth was placed in contact with graphite at 700°C for 110 hr, Ce2C2 was identified as a film on the graphite. Graphite contacted with 140 ppm Sm in bismuth at 800°C for 140 hr.

On the other hand, an x-ray diffraction pattern of the graphite surface was provided, which could not be identified or indexed. Under similar reaction conditions, neodymium, barium, or beryllium in bismuth solutions have no reaction product. However, Miller has shown by an autoradiograph technique that 180 ppm irradiated Nd in bismuth reacts with graphite at 1100°C in 100 hr, concentrating the radioactive Nd at the graphite-liquid metal interface. This experiment indicates that zirconium will probably form the carbide and nitride preferentially to most fission products. This point is not only important from the chemical and graphite surface point of view but is also important from the neutron economy point of view. To obtain the highest breeding ratio, the fission products, which are all fairly good neutron adsorbers, must be removed from the graphite core soon after their formation. This is especially true of samarium, which has a very high neutron absorption cross-section. Therefore, the experiments reported above on zirconium are quite encouraging in that there is no trace of a samarium film on the graphite.

21-6. 4 Radiation effects on graphite. The graphite core, in order to serve as a moderator and container for the flowing fuel, must be stable to radiation. Fission recoils may cause spalling and reduction in the thermal conductivity that might increase the thermal stresses within the core structure. The graphite must not adsorb large quantities of U or fission products.

However, some samples were treated with B-containing Zr at 1300°C to obtain 10- to 30-micron ZrN-ZrC layers on the graphite prior to irradiation. Post-irradiation examination indicated some change in this layer. The cause of these effects is still being determined.

The effect of neutrons on the growth and thermal conductivity properties of special low-permeability grades of graphite has been measured. Three sets of samples have been irradiated to exposures as great as 5 x 10^7 thermal neutrons/cm in the temperature range 400 to 475°C. Results of these tests are listed in Table 21-8. The change in physical length of the graphite is primarily contraction and should not present a major engineering problem.

On the other hand, the neutrons reduced the thermal conductivity by 25 to 35% of the pre-irradiation value. Moreover, some of these graphites had a pre-irradiation conductivity only 65% that of the usual reactor-grade graphite.

Bismuth penetration into graphite permits the diffusion of some uranium into the graphite. The resulting fission recoil particles may further reduce the thermal conductivity of graphite. Tests are now underway to determine the degree of damage produced.

21-6. 5 Bismuth permeation and diffusion into graphite. Early in the work on the Liquid Metal Fuel Reactor, it was recognized that a special type of graphite was required if it were to be both a moderator and a container for the reactor fluid. Such an impermeable graphite would have not only the usual advantages of being both a structural material and moderator but would also not hold up quantities of coolant or fuel, with resulting decreased neutron efficiency and control. Besides these characteristics, because the design fluxes are of the order of 10^5 n/(cm)(sec), it is necessary that the graphite have a high degree of resistance to radiation damage, specifically to physical growth and reduction in thermal conductivity.

In considering impermeable graphite, two characteristics of the graphite are concerned: liquid pickup and permeability. Liquid pickup refers to the amount of fluid which is held in the interior pore volume of the graphite in the manner of a sponge. Permeability is the rate at which a fluid can be made to flow through the graphite. Both these properties depend primarily on the accessible void volume and the pore spectrum.

In research work on graphite, it is customary to divide the size of pores into two categories: macropores larger than 1 micron and averaging 2. 5 microns in radius, and micropores with radii less than 1 micron and predominantly below 0. 5 microns.

The classic process of graphite manufacture is based on cokes and pitch binders, baking, and pitch reimpregnations, and finally graphitization. Around this scheme has evolved a complex technology involving careful particle and flour sizing to obtain optimum compaction, elaborate baking and graphitizing schedules, and extremes of pressure vacuum treatments. The production of the new relatively impermeable grades was made possible by three significant advances over the older technology: (1) the ability to use raw materials of a more advanced form, including graphites and blacks of various types; (2) impregnation techniques now span a variety of resins.

With various viscosity and wetting properties, and new forming techniques permit much more uniform and finer-grained artificial graphites. This last includes, in particular, the development of pressure baking, where heat is applied by passing electric current through the carbon in the mold and under pressure.

The conventional pitch-type impregnation has the effect of increasing density without markedly reducing permeability. This is apparently due to the tendency of the pitch to coke out only in the voids of large effective pore radius. Conversely, the newer impregnating materials, with their lower viscosities and increased wetting, tend to block the pores themselves as well as the larger open volumes. Consequently, there is no general relationship between density and permeability. Several conclusions may be drawn: (1) The newer impregnates primarily attack the macropore distribution and shift it from the 1- to 5-micron range into the submicron range. (2) Optimum particle packing in the original base material is, in general, not an advantage upon reimpregnation. (3) It is essential to use base materials in which the long tail at high pore radii is missing. The relatively minor effect of the present impregnates upon the micropore distribution demonstrates that the present materials, markedly improved as they are, do not as yet represent the achievable ultimate.

The amount of bismuth uptake in graphite is probably the most important property concerned in evaluating the graphite, and was one of the first investigated. For this purpose, a simple pot arrangement is used to hold samples of graphite in molten bismuth at pressures from vacuum to the difference in the density of the sample before and after submersion. The accuracy of this measurement is within 0. 01 g bismuth per cc graphite.

The degree of bismuth uptake by graphite as a function of time, determined at a pressure of 250 psi at 550°C, is shown. As was mentioned above, there is no correlation between uptake and graphite. The total percent of void volumes in the impregnated grades varies from 16. 0 to 19. 0% of the bulk volume. Of these totals, the inaccessible volumes range from 6 to 10%. Although samples EY-9 and ATL-82 have nearly the same density, the bismuth absorption differs by as much as a factor of 3 because of the difference in pore spectrum.

As can be seen from the figure, the amount of bismuth uptake varies as a function of time. This behavior was obtained using separate samples for each point on a curve and also by measuring the same sample at various time intervals. In making determinations, there is considerable oscillation about.

A mean value is found for investigations extended to as much as 3500 hr. Evidently, these variances are caused by outgassing by the graphite over the time interval of the experiment. Outgassing the graphite at 900°C instead of at 550°C reduced the amplitude of the excursions, but the mean value remained from 0. 425 to 0. 525 g bismuth per cc graphite for most of the types investigated. When the outgassing temperature was increased to 900°C, the saturation or maximum value of uptake was reached in some cases within 2. 5 hr.

The rate of bismuth penetration into graphite was determined to estimate the impact of an unexpected pressure excursion in the reactor. Samples underwent 250 psi for durations ranging from 5 seconds to 5 minutes, as depicted in Figure 14. This timeframe significantly surpasses that anticipated for a reactor pressure surge. The test conditions entailed 250 psi at 550°C following a 20-hour outgassing period at the same temperature. The data reveals that the practical maximum uptake occurs in about 10 seconds for all graphites except types A and G. These graphites, functioning more as coatings than bulk impregnations, exhibit a continuous increase in uptake over time. In a prolonged test, their equilibrium values were only attained after a considerable period.

In another series of tests, samples were immersed for 20 hours at 550°C at varying pressures, as shown in Figure 15. Increases beyond 200 psi. The remaining three types, A, G, EY-9, do increase continuously in bismuth uptake and furthermore show a threshold pressure below which no bismuth penetrates the graphite for the 20-hour duration of the test.

After a pressure surge in the reactor core, the operating pressure will return to approximately 120 psi, and the amount of bismuth in the graphite might decrease. To investigate this, samples impregnated at 450 psi were resubmerged in bismuth at 25 and at 100 psi to determine what quantity of bismuth might leave the graphite. The dotted lines connect these points. It can be seen that there is no significant reduction of the bismuth contained in each type of sample.

Calculations of the percent of voids filled with bismuth were made for the maximum bismuth uptake obtained in the experiments shown in Table 21-9. This table gives these calculated values for the approximate saturation level reached. In this table, the last graphite, AGOT, is the conventional reactor graphite. The 100% filling of the voids is obviously a good check of the assumption that it is quite permeable. All the other graphites are impermeable grades under development by various companies. The percent voids filled for these graphites do not represent total saturation of the accessible voids.

In studying the threshold penetration effect, surface tensions of bismuth on various surfaces of graphite were measured (Table 21-10). Although differing from the accepted values, these determinations probably represent more closely the actual circumstances in a reactor core. In none of the four cases was wetting of the graphite obtained by the bismuth or bismuth.

Means of the bismuth solution. Experiments to measure this effect have shown that the diffusion of uranium into the graphite was measured by sectioning the graphite and analyzing for uranium concentration as a function of distance from the surface of the sample. These experiments were run at 550°C with a pressure of 200 psi. Results of two experiments are given in Table 21-11. In the first experiment, the bismuth contained 390 ppm Mg and 1000 ppm U. The uranium concentration in the graphite specimen was found to be less than in the melt solution and decreased from the sample face inwards.

The second experiment was performed exactly like the first except that no magnesium was present. The graphite specimen (Great Lakes Type HLM) absorbs less bismuth than the EY-9 graphite used in the first experiment. This high value for the uranium-to-bismuth ratio near the interface may be explained by assuming that uranium reacted with impurities present on the graphite surfaces. Apparently, when magnesium is present in the solution, it reacts preferentially with these impurities.

These experiments definitely show that uranium and other solutes present in the bismuth can be expected to diffuse into the graphite as far as the bismuth has penetrated. For the graphites now at hand, this means diffusion through the entire thickness of the graphite for the long-term exposures contemplated in a reactor core. Of course, since the diffusion of uranium itself takes considerable time, fission will convert it to other products before it has an opportunity to diffuse many inches into the graphite. The effect of diffusion of the various solutes and fuel into graphite on neutron economy and reactor operational characteristics is recognized, and studies have to be made in large-scale experiments.

In general, it is believed that the graphites at hand will meet the requirements for the first experiment of an LMFR reactor. It is already possible to produce some of these in sizes as large as 40 to 60 inches in diameter. As this development progresses, graphites of greater impermeability will be produced. Improvements in graphite have taken place steadily, and markedly improved materials are anticipated in the future.

The Liquid Metal Fuel Reactor offers the opportunity for continuous removal of fission products from the fluid fuel by chemical and physical processing. By this procedure, the poisoning effect of the fission products may be kept to a low level, and thus makes possible a good breeding ratio in this thermal reactor.

In the FPV group, there are four elements: bromine, iodine, krypton, and xenon. Xenon is by far the most important because of its cross-section, 2,700,000 barns. Since this is so large, it is necessary to remove most of the iodine and xenon as soon as formed.

The other major poisons occur in the FPS group. In calculating the average atomic weight and cross-section of these groups, it is convenient to use the fission yield in milliatoms. Normally, it is assumed that two atoms of fission products are produced by the splitting of one atom of uranium. On this basis, Table 22-1 presents the FPS nuclides with the important information on their poisoning effect. As can be seen, Sm is the most important element to be dealt with in this group.

From the data given in these tables, it is possible to calculate the poison level in an LMFR as a function of time of operation. Besides the characteristics of the fission products themselves, the poison level is dependent mainly on the core fuel volume, the total fuel system volume, and the average core flux. It is assumed that the volatile poisons, FPV, can be removed in a steady-state operation, and the poisoning level kept to 1%. The other two classes, of course, steadily increase, based on the assumption of no chemical processing of the core. This level must be chosen by a careful economic optimization procedure.

Figure 22-1 shows that while the FPS group is the most important, assuming that the volatiles can be removed as desired, the FPN group does gradually accumulate, and after about 400 days of operation has a 1% poisoning effect. Hence, over long-term operation, processing of all the groups becomes desirable if a low poison level is to be maintained.

The poisoning in a U-235-fueled reactor is expected to be 10 to 20% higher than in a U-238-fueled reactor, depending on the average residence time of the fission products in the fuel. The cumulative poisoning effect of the higher uranium isotopes is also slightly higher.

In connection with this last point, the higher isotopes of uranium gradually build up throughout the operation of the reactor. In the calculations used in the reference design of Chapter 24 and in BAW-2, the poisoning effect of the higher uranium isotopes has been assumed as 2% for a U-33 fuel. Since these higher isotopes are chemically the same as the fuel, no provision can be made for a chemical separation from the U-33. The gradual buildup of the higher uranium isotope poisons can actually be tolerated over a number of years before becoming important in the economics of the reactor operation, as is shown in Chapter 24.

In all the foregoing discussions, it is assumed that corrosion products contribute very little to the poisoning in the reactor. However, this may not be so. As was described in Chapters 20 and 21, the corrosion rate of the containing metals by the bismuth fuel is rather high. Corrosion products such as iron and chromium at a concentration of 300 ppm in bismuth would contribute a poisoning effect of about 1%. However, the same processes that remove the FPS and FPN will also remove all the corrosion products.

22-2. 1 Xenon and iodine removal. For a 1% poisoning level, assuming no Xe adsorbed on, or absorbed by, the graphite moderator, the concentrations of 9. 13-hr Xe-135 and total Xe in the fuel are calculated to be 1. 5 and poisoning effect of all the other FPVs is negligible, so that the problem of FPV removal is really one of Xe-135 removal. Some typical statistics on the FPVs are summarized in Table 22-3. These figures are based on three assumptions: (a) that Xe buildup on the graphite is negligible, (b) that negligible amounts of Br and I are volatilized with the FPVs, and (c) that Kr and Xe have the same removal characteristics.

In Article 20-3. 3, it was shown that the actual solubility of xenon in bismuth may well be in the ppb range. McMillan calculated the solubility as 10-12. Since the amount of xenon generated is probably larger than its solubility in bismuth, it is necessary to determine the behavior of the gas in relation to the surfaces of the reactor core and fuel conduits, as it will have a strong tendency to escape from solution.

Since xenon is the decay daughter of I-135, it is born not only in the reactor core but throughout the fuel system wherever I-135 is present. Therefore, the chemical and kinetic behavior of I-135, its decay precursor, is important. The Xe-135 removal problem might be solved by desorption of Xe-135; however, it is found that I-135 decays so rapidly that at least 75% of the I-135 would have to be removed with the FPVs.

In order to significantly reduce the amount of Xe-135 formed, this is probably too much to be hoped for. Experimental results indicate that such a large fraction of the iodine cannot be volatilized from U-Bi fuel. Thermodynamic analysis indicates that the iodine, for the most part, should react with the Rb, Sr, Cs, and Ba fission products to form monoiodides, with about 70% of the iodine going to CsI.

These alkali and alkaline-earth iodides would presumably have low solubilities in Bi and, as a result, have a tendency to leave the U-Bi fuel and collect on unwetted solid surfaces. These iodides also transfer heavily to the salt in the FPS-removal process, but the rate of processing would be too slow to extract significant quantities of I35 and, in fact, most of the other iodine nuclides. Thus, there appear to be two predominant modes by which I departs from the fuel: physical expulsion in the form of iodides and radioactive decay.

22-2. 2 Xenon and iodine adsorption on graphite and steel. Graphite is not wet by the fuel; moreover, it has a void volume of almost 20%, largely composed of interconnected cells. These facts suggest the possibility of Xe buildup in an LMFR core.

A factor in this problem is the behavior of iodine in the LMFR fuel. The iodine may form rather insoluble iodides, then adsorb on unwetted surfaces, and there decay to Xe. Both kinetic and thermodynamic analyses indicate that this may be a real possibility.

In 1956, an in-pile loop was operated at Brookhaven in which fission products were generated in U-Bi fuel, where the natural U concentration was 800 ppm. Two steel rods, 1/2 in. in diameter and 4 in. long, were suspended vertically in the gas space of the surge tank, 2 in. above the liquid metal level. One was exposed for a period of 60 hr and showed an I-33 concentration of 9. 0 X 10^6 atoms/cm at the time of removal. The other, exposed for 85 hr, showed 1. 6 X 10^7 atoms/cm. The corresponding I concentration in the flowing metal was 1. 1 X 10^9 atoms/cm, which means that for every 100 atoms of I-33 per cc of fuel, there were roughly 1 to 8 I-33 atoms/cm of exposed surface in the gas space. The temperatures of the rods and liquid metal were the.

Several steel tabs, immersed for extended periods in the flowing metal, showed I-133 concentrations on their surfaces roughly 100 times those found on the rods suspended in the gas phase. Moreover, it was estimated that less than half of the I in the system was in the Bi; about 60% was found on the container walls contacting the Bi, and about 1% on the gas walls. The tabs were, for the most part, unwetted by the Bi.

To get a better understanding of this general problem, a two-part experimental program is underway at BNL. In the first part, capsule-scale experiments are being carried out to determine the action of iodine and xenon on graphite and steel capsules containing U-Bi fuel. These capsules are irradiated in the BNL pile and then examined for iodine, xenon, and radioactivity across the radius of the specimen. The second part of the program is a kinetic study of the removal of iodine and xenon in degassing.

In-pile capsule experiments. In one series of experiments, capsules made of 22% Cr-1% Mo steel and graphite were filled with Bi containing 500 to 1000 ppm of natural U, 350 ppm Mg, and 350 ppm Zr. The capsules were degassed under vacuum for 3 hr at 800°C before being filled. They were then irradiated in a flux of 2 x 10^12/(cm^2)(sec), with the U-Bi mixture frozen, for periods up to 2 wk. After irradiation, the capsules were held at 500°C for periods ranging from 10 min to 117 hr. They were then cooled quickly to room temperature and sectioned into 10 disks for radiochemical analysis. The concentrations of Xe-133, I-133, and U were measured at the center of each disk and in a 1-mm ring on the periphery of the Bi. The results are summarized in Table 22-4.

When the concentration of iodine generated by fission reaches a level where iodine concentrates at the interface between the Bi and the container wall, the concentration at the interface is about 1000 times higher than that in the bulk of the Bi for the steel capsules, and about 100 times higher than that for the graphite capsules.

When the concentration of Xe reaches a level of about 10^1 to 10^2, the Bi-steel interface is about 10,000 times that in the Bi. This ratio for graphite, G, is only 10 (G-020). The difference between the steel and graphite capsules is believed to be due to the fact that Xe diffuses into the latter. This penetration by fission-product gases has been found in other experiments and confirmed by autoradiographs and material balances.

When the concentrations of iodine and Xe are lower, i. e. , about 10 atoms/g, the differences between interface and core concentrations are much smaller, though still statistically significant (Xe in G-040; iodine in G-030 and G-040). For iodine, the concentration ratios vary slightly in G-040, and no significant separation was observed in G-030.

Samples G-080 and G-150 were agitated (by rotating them at 15 rpm around an axis passing at right angles through the middle of the capsule) while being equilibrated at 500°C for 75 hours. It is seen that in the case of the agitated samples, Xe segregation was unaffected, but I separation was appreciably reduced. However, the great bulk of the I was still found on the outer layer of the Bi.

Besides these experiments, another series was carried out in which the bismuth, containing uranium, was molten during irradiation so that the xenon and iodine had a chance to escape as soon as formed. Figure 22-2 is an example of a typical experiment. In the figure, the central dark area is the bismuth core. The bright band is that part of the graphite since the picture represents a magnification of 4 times. The conditions for this particular experiment are given in Table 22-5. The irregularities observed in the photograph are in accordance with the heterogeneity of the.

The results of all these experiments show that I and Xe concentrate very heavily on surfaces in contact with the U-Bi fuel. There is evidence that Xe and radioactive gases penetrate the graphite and are immobilized therein. This may present a very serious problem in keeping the LMFR fission-product poisoning to the low levels required for economic breeding. The reported experiments, however, have been limited by the available neutron flux of the BNL pile to concentration levels about 1/1000 those anticipated in an LMFR breeder. Extrapolation of the present results to the LMFR levels is not justified, since it is conceivable that because of saturation effects, the concentrations at the interfaces may not increase proportionately. However, the penetration of Xe in the graphite, as contrasted to its accumulation at interfaces, is a potentially serious problem because of the large surfaces available inside the graphite.

The results of these experiments clearly indicate that the removal of the FPVs is not a simple degassing operation. An increased research program is underway to learn more about the release and movement of the FPVs in both the reactor core and in the fuel streams. While degassing equipment designed to afford a large fluid surface for escape of the gases will probably be the best kind of equipment, the volatiles may very well never arrive at the degasser at all. Instead, they may adhere to the graphite walls and to the steel walls. Operation of the LMFR Experiment No. I should give extremely valuable information on this particular question.

22-2. 3 Design of equipment for FPV removal. In the LMFR, the fuel would flow continuously through several parallel loops to external heat exchangers for cooling. Degassing equipment would, in all probability, be located in each of these loops.

Streams were processed continuously; the fraction of FPV in the fuel removed per pass would only be about 0. 004. Since the solubilities of Kr and Xe in Bi increase with temperature, the degassing equipment should preferably be located in the coldest part of the system. However, since the fuel flow through the reactor is upward, and the degassers must be located at the top of the system due to hydrostatic pressure, it is not very practical to locate them at the coldest point.

The main objective would be to prevent excessive amounts of Xe from being adsorbed on, or absorbed in, the graphite moderator. To achieve this, two conditions are necessary: first, the relative amount of I settling on the graphite must be kept low, and second, the degassers must be very efficient. The problem is not so much one of desorbing Xe from a Bi solution as it is one of controlling the accumulation of I and Xe on unwetted surfaces. To minimize I buildup on the graphite, the fuel velocity in the core should be as high as practical, and there should be solid surfaces located somewhere between the core and the degassers to collect I.

On the basis of present knowledge, the degassers should be so designed that a large interfacial area is provided, and that the liquid metal surface is as turbulent as possible. Theoretically, a degasser should work with good efficiency. A theoretical analysis by McMillan (BNL-353) showed that xenon has a tremendous tendency to concentrate on liquid bismuth surfaces. For a spherical volume, the number of xenon atoms on the surface was estimated to be about 10^8 times the number dissolved in bismuth at 300°C. At 500°C, this ratio came close to 10^3.

A sieve-plate column, in which the fuel descends in fine streams, would be such a degasser. It is felt that sparging of an inert gas into the fuel is not necessary to promote gas desorption, since Xe is so insoluble. However, depending on the gas pressure in the degasser, the use of an inert carrier gas may be desirable. The effluent fission gases would be collected in refrigerated charcoal beds.

In processing the molten bismuth for the removal of fission product poisons, the ideal process would be a pyrometallurgical one operating at substantially the same temperature as the fuel. Furthermore, this process should either leave the uranium fuel in the bismuth or treat it in such a manner that it is relatively easy to recharge it as a metal into the bismuth stream for reuse. The LMFR thus offers an excellent opportunity for the application of pyrometallurgical chemical reprocessing methods. From a procedural point of view, such methods should inherently be cheaper than presently known aqueous processing methods. It will be necessary, however.

However, since the LMFR offers such an excellent opportunity for the application of cheap pyrometallurgical processing, this path has been explored quite extensively. In this section, a fused chloride salt process for the removal of fission poisons is described. In following sections, a fluoride volatility process and a noble fission product removal process are.

Table. Within this group, the lanthanides account for about 94% of the total poisoning effect of the FPS elements. In the case of a typical 500-MW reactor, the concentration of FPS elements in the bismuth amounts to about 17 ppm. To reduce this concentration to acceptable levels, a process has been developed whereby the FPS elements are oxidized by, and then extracted into a fused salt.

Following the original suggestion by Winsche that fission products might be extractable from a liquid U-Bi fuel by molten salts in a manner similar to solvent extraction, experiments were conducted by Bareis using the LiCl-KCl eutectic and lanthanide-bismuth alloys. If the mechanism was indeed one of liquid-liquid extraction, then the lanthanide distribution should follow a simple distribution law, and as such be independent of total concentration. Experimentally, this was not the case, and it was subsequently shown by Wiswall and later independently by Cubicciotti that the results could be explained by assuming that a chemical reaction had occurred as follows.

At equilibrium, assuming the initial uranium concentration in the bismuth is 1000 ppm, the ratio of the mole fraction of U in salt to the mole fraction of U in Bi will be equal to 6. 8 x 10-4. Thus, in principle, a selective oxidation of the lanthanides may be achieved in the presence of uranium. Of course, the assumption that activities are equal to mole fractions is only an approximation.

Ternary salt. As a consequence of these reactions, lithium metal builds up in the bismuth phase and in view of its high thermal neutron cross section, replacement of the lanthanide by lithium offers no advantage in terms of neutron economy.

Therefore, another low-melting salt, the ternary eutectic of MgCl2 (50 mole%), KCl (20%), and NaCl (30%) (MP 396°C), was investigated. In this system, the free energy of formation of MgCl2 is intermediate between those of the lanthanide chlorides on one hand and uranium trichloride on the other, and a satisfactory, although not complete, separation should be achieved. Furthermore, the low neutron cross-section of Mg is more favorable than that of lithium, and a low concentration of Mg in the fuel (250 ppm) appears to be necessary in order to minimize corrosion and mass transfer in the steel equipment. The magnesium concentration in the bismuth will therefore control the extent of the reaction.

In the above, a = thermodynamic activity, X = mole fraction, and f and f are activity coefficients. It is equivalent to the Henry's law constant.

Experimental values of these constants are given in Table 22-7. Comparison of theory and experiment. In order to compare theory with experiment, Keq, Xmgch, and the activity coefficients of the pertinent substances in each phase must be known. Keq is easily calculated from the AF for the appropriate reaction by means of the relation AF = -RT ln Keq. Xmgch may be considered essentially constant and equal to 0. 5, since MgCl2 is present in the salt phase in large excess over the other reactants, and its concentration changes only very slightly during the reaction. Recently, Egan has measured the partial molar free energy of mixing, AF, of magnesium in bismuth and cerium in bismuth by galvanic cell methods. These values are estimated to be fmg = 2 x 10^-3 and fce = 3 x 10^7.

For example, the entire difference between the experimental value and calculated value of K may be reconciled if one assumes an error of 1. 4 kcal/atom Cl in the ΔF of formation of CeCl3. Such an error is well within the limits with which the standard free energies of formation are known at these temperatures. The estimated activity coefficients of metals in bismuth may also be in error by as much as a factor of 2 to 3.

Equation (22-11) predicts that a plot of log Xsmc/Xsm versus log Xmg should yield a straight line of slope −1. The curve is shown in Figure 3, and the line is drawn with a slope of −1. This line yields the value of B given in Table 22-7. With the assumption that f$nci = 0. 1, the estimated activity coefficient at infinite dilution of samarium in bismuth is.

The validity of Eq. (22-6) is dependent upon the assumption that side reactions, such as the oxidation of bismuth by the salt, are negligible. Since AF for these reactions are large positive numbers, it is reasonable to consider bismuth as inert in this respect. Bismuth, of course, interacts with the lanthanides and magnesium very strongly, but this is taken into account by the use of activity coefficients.

Do not contribute significantly to the transfer of lanthanides to the salt phase, in view of the large positive free energy change. This approximation was checked experimentally by determining the concentrations of Na and K in the bismuth phase after an equilibration experiment. No detectable amounts of alkali metals were found in the bismuth. This result also indicates that salt solubility in bismuth is negligibly low. Analysis of the salt phase for bismuth yielded low, erratic results, possibly due to the slight solubility of bismuth in 1N HCl which occurred during the aqueous separation of salt and metallic phases. It is highly improbable that bismuth would be soluble in a salt of this type.

Another assumption made in this analysis involves the reversibility of the oxidation of the lanthanides by MgCl₂. This point was checked by equilibrating a series of Mg-Bi alloys with a salt eutectic containing CeCl₃. The distribution data of cerium as a function of Mg concentration in the bismuth derived from the reduction of CeCl₃ by Mg shows the reaction is reversible within an experimental error of 10%.

Data for process design. It will be noted from the relative positions of the lines of -3 that it is not possible to assume, a priori, that the order of the lanthanide distributions will be directly predictable from free energy of formation data. For example, from Table 22-6, the order of decreasing stability of the chlorides is Sm, La, Ce, and Nd, whereas at constant Xmg, the experimental order is La, Sm, Nd, and Ce. The difference in order is apparently due to the large variation of the activity coefficients of the lanthanides in bismuth.

The results of the lanthanide distribution experiments have provided a basis for the design of a countercurrent, salt-metal extraction process. Results of uranium distribution studies indicate that in small-scale experiments, a satisfactory separation of lanthanides from uranium may be achieved in a single equilibrium contacting stage.

22-3. 2 Pilot plant equilibrium experiments. The contacting vessels, made of 347 stainless steel, have a capacity of about 2 liters. They can be fitted with liners of other metals in order to study the effect of surfaces and corrosion. Each contactor is equipped with connections through which materials can be added and removed without admitting air, a sight port, gas and vacuum connections, heaters, and thermocouples.

The most significant results of this pilot plant program are those from experiments for which an apparatus of large capacity alone could serve. These are studies of the stability of the solutions for long periods and of the changes in equilibrium distribution resulting from the addition of various reagents. In general, the distribution coefficients obtained in this equipment confirm those found in the small-scale work; however, the precision of the results is less.

In carrying out experiments in these equilibrium vessels, a stability sufficient for most practical purposes can be achieved, given the right operating conditions, but there are still unsolved problems. A solution of Bi, U, Mg, rare earth, and Zr can be kept at 500°C under helium in a stainless steel vessel indefinitely without a change of composition. If then a quantity of pre-treated salt is added to the system, a significant drop occurs in the salt phase, but not in an amount equivalent to the loss from the metal. Thereafter, the U concentration remains constant but the Mg in the metal suffers a slow decline, losing between 1 and 10 ppm per day. As its concentration decreases, the distribution of elements such as the rare earths changes in about the way which would be predicted from the results of the gram-scale experiments. The U remains nearly constant unless the Mg is allowed to drop below about 20 ppm, in which case U begins to transfer to the salt.

From some of these systems, a solid material has been recovered that gives the X-ray pattern of uranium nitride, and it is possible that nitrogen from the container walls is somehow involved in the mysterious behavior of U and Mg. Since very small quantities of the various materials are involved in these reactions, it is quite possible that solid surface adsorption effects are also playing a part in the instability of composition.

In a second series of experiments, the change in equilibrium distribution from the addition of reagents is being studied. In the FPS extraction process, a sequence of columns operated at different oxidation potentials is proposed. Most of these changes in equilibrium are controlled by the addition of BiCl3 or Mg to the system at appropriate points. Experiments have been done in which these reagents have been added to a salt-metal system at equilibrium. The results of two such experiments will illustrate the behavior of these systems. In the first, an initial equilibrium was established in which the metal phase contained a fairly high concentration.

The approximate value of Mg, along with those of the other constituents, is given in the first row of Table 22-9, Run 1. Due to challenges in sampling and analysis, these figures may be incorrect by 10 to 20%. A quantity of BiCls, exceeding that of all the Mg, was then added. Upon reaching a new equilibrium, it was observed that all the Mg and a significant portion of the Zr and U were extracted from the metal phase. The second row presents the analytical data. Subsequently, metallic Mg was introduced to reverse the reaction, and the final equilibrium state is depicted in the figures of the last row. Remarkably, the U content in the metal was restored to its initial level. Notably, this restoration occurred despite the final Mg concentration being significantly lower than the original concentration, indicating that the U distribution coefficient was unaffected by the Mg concentration when the latter exceeded 100 ppm. This observation aligns with the findings from the earlier laboratory experiments. Further validation was achieved in Run 2, where a BiCls quantity lower than the Mg equivalent was added. The outcomes are detailed in Table 22-9, Run 2. In this scenario, as the Mg concentration decreased from 320 to 140 ppm, the Ce distribution coefficient rose as anticipated, while the U concentration remained constant.

Reaction rates. Previously, the equilibrium for the salt-metal reactions was discussed. It was shown that most probably more than one equilibrium contact will be required to remove the FPS. This means that some kind of contacting between two flowing streams will be required.

The overall chemical processing utilizes the fused chloride salt method. Therefore, an examination of the reaction rates is important. When several equilibrium contacting stages are required, and it is desired to do this in a flowing countercurrent system, it is necessary for the mass transfer rates to be fast.

In this reaction, there are at least three stages: transport of the reactants to the salt-metal interface, the reaction proper involving the exchange of electrons, and transport of the products away from the interface. Situations are conceivable in which any of these could be rate-limiting. In investigating so complex a situation experimentally, it is often possible to order things so that one or more stages are fast relative to the others, thus permitting the kinetics of the latter to be studied alone. If, for example, the reaction is made to go under conditions which are far from equilibrium, i. e. , the reverse reaction proceeding to only a negligible extent, the transport kinetics of certain species can be excluded from consideration.

A series of experiments of this type was carried out in which 2. 2-mm drops of Bi containing 200 ppm Sm fell through 31 cm of molten ternary salt eutectic. At the bottom, the drops were drawn off and analyzed. The salt phase was initially free of rare earths, and its volume was 500 times that of the total Bi which fell through, so transport of species in the salt phase should not be rate-limiting. The contact time for each drop was about 0. 6 sec. Analysis showed that 75% of the Sm was extracted into the salt. If we calculate the amount that would have been extracted had the rate been limited by diffusion of solute to the surface of a spherical drop, assuming rapid reaction at the interface, a smaller figure results. It may be concluded that some turbulence exists within the drop, assisting the diffusion process, and that the interface reaction is indeed fast.

Although further rate studies are required, the results at hand show that considerable latitude is available to the process engineer in designing the overall process using these equilibrium and rate data. These possible designs may range from straight batch-type contacting to completely automated countercurrent contacting.

Equilibrium partition coefficients for Ce, Zr, and U as functions of Mg concentration are shown in Figure 3. For a particular Mg concentration, the ratio of the Ce coefficient to that of U is a direct measure of how difficult it is to achieve a given degree of separation between the two solutes.

Ce is one of the least stable of the FPS chlorides, but in the treatment that follows, FPS salt-metal equilibrium coefficients are taken to be the same as that of Ce; that is, they are conservative. The slope of the Ce and U lines in -3 is -1. 5, signifying trivalency in the salt phase, while that of the Zr is shown as -1, signifying divalency. The Zr line is drawn dashed because experimental results are still preliminary, and the slope of -1 was assumed rather than being firmly established by experiment. Unfortunately, the data available at this writing were obtained over a rather short range of Mg concentration. Of the FPS, Rb and Cs are univalent, and Ba, Sr, and Sm are divalent, but all of these lie well above the Ce line and would, therefore, be more easily extracted.

The total energy release per fission in the LMFR is estimated to be 194 MeV. For a reactor having a heat rate of 500 MW, this means that 542 g of U235 would be fissioned per day. Since the FPS represent about 44% of the total fission products by weight, 238 g of FPSs must be removed per day to maintain a steady concentration in the fuel. The Zr concentration is kept at about 250 ppm for purposes of corrosion inhibition, and the steady-state removal rate of this fission product will be approximately 59 g/day. It is interesting to note that about 11% of the fission products end up as Zr. For a reactor with a heat rate of 500 MW and a total fuel inventory of 150 tons, a fission-product Zr concentration.

The high concentration of Mg makes it difficult to extract the FPS, but the high concentration of Zr makes it easier to extract that particular element. The high Mg concentration rules out the possibility of using a buffer method and necessitates the use of a stoichiometric method in the FPS removal step. Sufficient oxidizing agent (in this case BiCl3) is added to the salt to remove the required fractions of FPS and Zr. At the same time, most of the Mg in the fuel is unavoidably oxidized.

After a suitable holdup period, the fuel flows at the rate of 0. 34 gpm through column 1, the removal column. This column, as shown, has a separative capacity equivalent to two equilibrium stages. The bottom stage operates under oxidizing conditions, while the top one operates under reducing conditions. This brings about relatively high concentrations in the middle of the column. The increase in the U concentration in the fuel, in passing through the column, is to provide the necessary U makeup for the reactor. The first of these by itself would be of little consequence; the second would be very.

In column 2, the U in the salt stream from column 1 is recovered by extracting it into a second Bi stream. This column operates under the buffer system, even though the Mg concentration in the metal stream drops 52%. The separative capacity of this column is equivalent to four equilibrium stages, and the variations of solute concentrations throughout the column would be at such a value that the cost per gram of recovering any additional U would be more than it is worth. The process design of column 2 is controlled by the fact that the concentration of Zr in the exit salt stream has to be 54 ppm for a salt flow rate of 2436 lb/day and a reactor with a 500-Mw heat rate, i. e. , 59 g of fission-product Zr must be removed per desirable, and the third would be undesirable. The last effect is actually controlling, which means that a three-stage separation is not as good as a two-stage separation. Going in the other direction, a one-stage separation gives very much lower FPS/U and Zr/U ratios in the exit salt, thereby increasing the difficulty of subsequent U recovery. The optimum number of equilibrium stages probably lies between one and two.

Day. When the Zr concentration in the exit salt stream is fixed, the concentration of the FPS is also fixed, for the ratio FPS/Zr in the exit salt stream must be the same ratio in which these materials are generated in the fuel.

The processing Bi stream, column 2, contains 185 ppm Mg but no other solutes. In passing through the column, the Mg concentration in the Bi drops to 88 ppm, which means that the oxidation-reduction potential between the salt and Bi phases changes appreciably throughout the column.

The fission products, Mg, and U in the Bi stream from column 2 are all oxidized completely into the incoming salt stream B in vessel 3. The stripped Bi, after the addition of 185 ppm Mg, is then returned to column 2 to repeat its cycle. The Mg-Bi stream is so small that a few days' supply could be prepared on a batch basis if continuous addition of Mg to the recirculating Bi stream proved difficult to control.

The exit salt from column 2 can be treated with a Ba-Bi or Ca-Bi solution to remove the FPS and U, thus making it possible to recirculate the salt. The FPSs and U could then be slagged out of the Bi into a low-cost salt mixture for storage.

The flowsheet in Figure 4, for the sake of simplicity, does not show holdup and storage tanks, instrumentation, pumps, or heat exchangers. There are several possible variations of this flowsheet, but, for the most part, they include the three types of operations described above.

Owing to the fact that the oxidation-reduction potential varies considerably throughout the FPS removal column, it may be preferable to operate it with concurrent flow within each stage and countercurrent flow between stages. Alternatively, two separate concurrent columns could be used. The U recovery column, on the other hand, would clearly be operated with countercurrent flow because, chemically, conditions are reductive throughout the column.

Design of extraction columns: The mechanical design of a proposed extraction column is shown in Figure 7. Fuel enters at the top of the column and is dispersed by the slots in each tray as it falls through the column. The flow paths are indicated by arrows. Coalescence of the fuel drops occurs on each tray. Salt, as the continuous phase, may flow either concurrently with or countercurrently to the fuel. Fuel coalescence promotes thorough local mixing in the fuel and at the same time tends to minimize axial dispersion in each phase.

Columns of the type shown in Figure 7, about 3 to 6 ft long and 3 to 4 in. in diameter, are expected to have satisfactory performance characteristics. Such columns have not yet been tested under conditions simulating actual practice, although their fluid dynamical behavior has been studied with H₂O and Hg as substitutes for salt and Bi.

23~3. 5 Process control of fused chloride process. The objective of the process described above is to remove 59 g of fission-product Zr and 238 g of FPS from the fuel per day, while only losing 2 g of U. For this, careful control of the process is required. Continuous measurement of the U concentrations in the salt streams from columns 1 and 2 will be necessary.

First, the BiCl3 concentration in the inlet salt stream to column 1 and the Mg concentration in the inlet Bi stream to column 2; each of these must be controlled to give the proper concentrations of U in the salt leaving columns 1 and 2. The operation of column 1 is the more difficult to control. There are three inlet salt streams which eventually merge into the single stream entering column 1. Stream A contains about 92% of the total BiCl3 requirements, B contains about 2%, and C contains the remainder. At least one day's supply of each stream would be prepared in advance.

The Mg concentration in the exit fuel is a sensitive indication of the rate of BiCls addition to the column and, consequently, of the U concentration in the exit salt.

Figure 22-8 shows the effect of variation in the Mg concentration in the exit fuel stream of column 1 on the steady-state concentrations of FPS, Zr, and U in the exit fuel and salt streams.

The control of column 2 should be much less of a problem. The Mg concentration in the inlet Bi stream must be kept within certain limits to maintain the desired concentration of U in the exit salt. Actually, column 2 can, to a considerable degree, correct for malfunctioning of column 1.

The salt flow rate, and inserting a holdup tank between columns 1 and 2 to ensure uniform composition of the salt entering column 2. As an extreme measure, the first column could be replaced by equilibration vessels, but this would appear to be an unlikely eventuality. The magnitude of the problem is defined by the continuous processing requirements, namely, maintaining close control of very low uranium and fission product concentrations in streams of three interdependent contacting towers.

22-3. 6 Processing to reduce radiation hazard. The continuous process described above is based on an FPS concentration of approximately 18 ppm and calls for a processing rate of 0. 45 gpm. These conditions were chosen based on poisoning considerations. If, however, safety considerations were the determining factor, the processing rate would be greatly increased. If the whole fuel stream were processed daily for the removal of FPS, the concentrations of Sr and Cs-87, the two worst fission nuclides from the standpoint of biological hazard, could each be kept down to about 0. 1 ppm.

22-3. 7 Pilot plant program for fused chloride process. Components such as pumps, valves, and control instruments are under development and testing. Concurrently, a corrosion test program is ongoing, as discussed in Section 21-5. A full-sized prototype pilot plant for the testing and operation of a single extraction column is now being fabricated and constructed (Loop N). This pilot plant has been designed to circulate quantities of bismuth fuel and fused salt comparable to those for a full-sized reactor, as discussed previously in this chapter. In this pilot plant, it is planned to obtain operational data that will lead to a full-scale processing plant.

As an alternative to the fused chloride process, a pyrometallurgical process based on the volatility of UF6 has been suggested by the Argonne National Laboratory. A schematic flowsheet is given in Chapter 24. This process would be operated batchwise.

In this process, a batch of molten salt made up of 50% ZrF4 and 50% NaF is poured into the graphite hydrofluorinator and heated to 600°C. The fused salt is then sparged with HF gas, dissolving approximately 3 wt%. After the HF gas is cut off, bismuth-uranium core fluid containing FPS is introduced at the top of the vessel. Salt-metal contacting time is long enough to permit hydrofluorination of the FPS, FPN, and U in the core fluid and subsequent extraction of the resulting fluorides into the fused salt.

Salt melt. Excess HF is sent to a scrub tower not shown in the figure. The stripped bismuth is continuously withdrawn from the bottom of the column into a storage tank, leaving enough Bi for a liquid seal. The fluoride salt containing all the poisons and UF is then routed to a nickel fluorination vessel in which UTh is fluorinated to UI by direct contacting with fluorine gas. Other salts, such as MoIs, TeIs, RuIe, AsIs3, IPs, and MbFs, are also formed in this step since they are present as fission poisons. Since all of these materials are volatile, they will leave the fluoride melt with the excess fluorine and will then be condensed in a cold trap maintained at approximately -40°C. An NaF trap removes traces of TeIs, AsIs, and RuFg from the fluorine before it is recycled. These volatile fluorides are then sublimed from the cold trap by heating to about 100°C and distilled in order to complete the separation and purification of UFs from the other volatile fluorides.

The gaseous UF6 is reduced by bubbling it with an excess of hydrogen through fresh molten fluoride salt. The resultant UF6 is trapped in this clean salt melt. As shown in Figure 18, the salt containing UF6 is next contacted with the stripped bismuth stream in an electrochemical reduction step. In this step, the UF6 is reduced to metal at a flowing bismuth cathode while fluorine gas is released at the anode. The resultant bismuth-uranium alloy, to which Mg and Zr have previously been added, is ready for reentry.

Although the development work on this process is not as far advanced as on the fused chloride process, enough work has been done so that the process appears feasible. Small-scale laboratory work has indicated that the hydrofluorination step can be carried out successfully. Previous work in other areas of the atomic energy program has supplied considerable information on the direct fluorination step and the volatile fluoride distillation step. In the other areas of this process, less information is currently available.

The chief advantages of the fluoride volatility process are that it will be operated batchwise and will provide a complete, clean separation between the uranium and all the fission products. This allows comparatively easy control of the cleanup of the fuel and preparation of new fuel for the reactor. Since each step of this process is batch, the instrumentation would be comparatively simple, and the operators would have complete independent control of each step.

On the other hand, there are many difficult problems being encountered in developing this process further. One of them is the severe corrosion encountered in the various steps. The chemistry of the hydrofluorination in the first step has to be proven out conclusively.

Close temperature control, the oxidation of bismuth can be prevented. However, the free energy of formation of bismuth fluoride is rather close to those of some of the fission products. From an economic point of view, some means will probably have to be found for cutting down the cost of fluoride salts sent to waste. Zirconium fluoride is quite expensive and could be an important item in the total expense of the program.

The FPN group, minus Mo, represents 11% of the total fission products. With practically all the Mo out of solution, a 400-day residence time gives an FPN concentration of 177 ppm with a reactor poisoning effect of about 0. 8% for a 500-Mw reactor. To maintain that concentration, the fuel would have to be processed at the rate of only 9. 2 gal/day, assuming complete removal of the FPNs. The size of the batches, and therefore the frequency of processing, would be determined by economic factors. Processing would begin probably after 400 days of full-power operation.

22-5. 2 Chemistry of NFPN removal by zinc drossing. The process adopted for the NFPN fission products is basically the same as the Parkes process for desilvering Bi. Experiments conducted by the American Smelting and Refining Co. , under a research subcontract with the Brookhaven National Laboratory, and by Argonne National Laboratory have given very encouraging results. A few results are given in Tables 22-12 and 22-13 to illustrate the high efficiency of the process. In a series of experiments, Ru, Pd, and Te were dissolved in Bi at 500°C. Zn was added in three concentrations, 1, 2, and 3%. In each case, the mixture was agitated and then cooled to 400°C. The concentrations of the original solutes, both in the filtered Bi solution and in the skimmed-off dross, are shown in Table 22-12.

22-5. 3 FPN removal for the fused chloride process. The zinc drossing process has been modified for use with either the fused chloride or the fluoride volatility process. In both cases, the FPN removal is essentially the same.

Flowsheet. The proposed process is represented in -10. From the FPS-removal plant, the fuel is charged to vessel 1, which is an equilibration tank having both agitation and heat-removal facilities. Here it is contacted with ternary chloride salt and just enough BiCl3 to oxidize the FPS, Mg, Zr, and U into the salt. The fuel stream is then fed into vessel 3, where practically all the FPN fission products are removed from the Bi with Zn. The more noble fission products form intermetallic compounds with Zn, which are skimmed off the top of the Bi after cooling it close to its freezing point. Thus far, it is known that Se, Nb, Te, Ru, Rh, and Pd of the treatment. It is a general observation that all elements more noble than Bi are removable by Zn. The extents to which the FPN elements Cd, In, Sn, and Sb and the NFPN element Tc are removed by Zn have not yet been determined. It is probable that both In and Sn will not be appreciably.

The concentration of Zn required is less than 0. 5%, which is well below its solubility limit at 500°C. The Bi from vessel 3 is charged to vessel 4, where the residual Zn and FPN are removed by oxidizing them to chlorides with a ternary chloride salt containing BiCl3 (Cl sparging could also be used). The stripped Bi is then fed to vessel 2, where it is contacted with the salt from vessel 1. Sufficient Mg is added to the Bi in the vessel to transfer all.

Vessel 2 can be eliminated, and its function taken over by vessel 1. The two vessels were included in -10 for convenience in explaining the process. All vessels are similar in design and equal in size. To handle 275 gallons (one month's accumulation) of metal, they should have a total volume of about 350 gallons. The operations in vessels 1 and 2 should be conducted in O2-free atmospheres, but this condition is not necessary for the operations carried out in vessels 3 and 4.

Molybdenum removal. Mo is truly a special member of the NFPN group. Its solubility at 375°C, probably the coldest fuel temperature, is estimated to be less than 1 ppm. Moreover, it is produced at a rate equivalent to 0. 38 ppm/day. Thus, probably the most feasible way to remove Mo would be to precipitate it out of solution onto cold fingers immersed in the circulating fuel. The precipitation rate for a 500-MW reactor would be 54 g/day, most of which would be stable Mo. Even with cold traps, some Mo will be present.

Polonium removal: The behavior of Po in the FPS and FPN removal processes described above is not clear. Chemically, it is more noble than Bi and should not form an intermetallic compound with Zn, indicating that it should always remain with the Bi. In preliminary equilibration experiments with chloride salt mixtures, it was found that about 1% of the Po transferred to the salt, but whether this was due to chemical oxidation or volatilization is not presently known.

Heat generation rates: The maximum rate of heat removal from the charge in vessel 1 is estimated to be about 290 kW (250 from the fission products and 40 from the Po) and from vessel 3 about 240 kW (200 from the fission products and 40 from the Po). These values can be greatly reduced by allowing the 275 gallons of fuel to “cool off for several days before processing.

22-5. 4 FPN removal process for the fluoride volatility process. The flowsheet for this proposed process is given in Figure 20. The feed stream contacts a small amount of zinc (approximately 0. 5 wt%). As the contents are cooled, the zinc forms intermetallics with the FPN and NFPN elements, as described previously. This zinc dross floats to the top, is skimmed off, and sent to the zinc waste. From the bottom of the vessel, the bismuth stream containing some zinc is sent to a zinc crystallizer, where the temperature is further decreased. Some of the zinc crystallizes and is removed from the top for recycling back to the first vessel. It is proposed to remove the remaining zinc by a distillation operation shown on the flowsheet as Still. The bismuth from the Still is ready for return to the volatility plant for the addition of uranium, magnesium, and zirconium.

The entire FPN plant would be operated batchwise. The quantity of material handled would probably be about the same as for the previous process, about 275 gallons.

As is pointed out in Chapter 20, the easiest blanket to handle in the LMFR would be a 10 w/o thorium-bismuthide slurry in bismuth. Chemical processing of this blanket would be very similar to the core processes already described. Two examples of proposed processes are shown in -11, which shows a process that can be used with the fused chloride salt FPS removal process and in -19, which shows a flowsheet for a process to be used with the fluoride volatility process.

In the process of -11, a typical two-fluid 500-MW LMFR would have a blanket of about 400 tons of material containing approximately 10% Th and 90% Bi. The material balance shows that 5. 52 tons/day would be withdrawn and processed. In the first step, an additional 5. 52 tons/day of bismuth-containing fresh thorium is added to the stream.

Primarily to dilute the thorium bismuthide to half its first value, this slurry is then raised in temperature until a complete solution is obtained. When this is done, all the uranium and protactinium as well as fission products dissolve in bismuth. The U, Pa, and fission products will remain in solution in the bismuth. Then a phase separation at 350°C can be carried out. This gives a recycle stream of 5. 52 tons/day containing 10% Th going back to the blanket and 5. 52 tons/day of Bi with about 95% of the original U and Pa dissolved in it.

In the last step, the Pa is allowed to decay to U for about 130 days. At the end of this time, practically all (99. 5%) of the Pa would be converted to U, and the U would be separated from the Th and FPS by the methods previously described. As shown on the flowsheet, this would result in the production of approximately 500 g/day of U8 for charging into the core.

Basically, in evaluating the economics of chemical processing, the cost of neutrons in the form of uranium fuel wasted to fission-product poisoning must be balanced against the cost of operating the chemical processing units for removal of the fission-product poisons. In the overall operation of an LMFR reactor and its auxiliary chemical processing plant, the attainment of the highest breeding ratio will not necessarily give the lowest breeding ratio.

As is shown in Chapter 24, the chemical processes now available and under development are so expensive relative to the cost of fuel that optimization of the reactor conditions for a two-region reactor indicates a most economic breeding ratio of about 0. 86, and for a single-region reactor about 0. 75.

Increasing the cost of chemical processing. However, it must be kept in mind that the fission products are not the only neutron poisons present in the LMFR. Such other neutron poisons as bismuth, the structural materials, and the higher uranium isotopes will be present even though the fission and corrosion product levels are kept to zero percent.

The LMFR readily lends itself to a wide variety of designs and arrangements. The concepts proposed to date may be classified according to type as being internally or externally cooled, and either compact or open arrangement of the cycle. Such classification has been brought about in an attempt to present designs which minimize bismuth and uranium inventories.

If we assume the cost of U-235 to be $20/g and that of bismuth to be $2. 25/lb, a U-Bi solution of 700 ppm uranium by weight would cost approximately $6000/ft. This high-volume cost makes it very important to design the LMFR with the minimum possible holdup.

In addition to the variety of cycle arrangements, several different coolants are possible. The U-Bi may be used directly to produce steam, or a secondary fluid such as NaK or sodium may be used. The LMFR has also been proposed as the heat source for a closed-cycle gas turbine power.

Fuel is circulated through the core to an external heat exchanger, where the heat is removed by the secondary fluid. This type provides the simplest core design, requiring simply an assembly of graphite pierced with holes for circulation of liquid-metal fuel. The major problems of heat transfer are essentially removed from the core design.

The internally cooled design offers a means of substantially reducing the U-Bi inventory of the system but considerably complicates the design of the core. The core must be designed to accommodate two fluids and sufficient surface for transferring heat from one to the other. The introduction of a secondary fluid in the core requires a greater uranium concentration than in the externally cooled system, which has only U-Bi and graphite in the core. The required concentration cannot be achieved with U-Bi.

23-1. 3 Compact arrangements. The compact arrangement may best be described as an integral or "pot type" design and may be internally or externally cooled. In such a design, the fluid fuel remains in the core, except for small amounts which are withdrawn for reprocessing. The breeding fluid acts as a coolant by circulating through the blanket and core, and then through heat exchangers, which are also contained within the primary.

Arrangement for a closed-cycle gas turbine power plant. In this arrangement, the fuel is circulated through the core and heat exchanger, which are contained inside the same vessel. The compact arrangement offers a means of reducing the U-Bi inventory over a particular reactor designed with an open-cycle arrangement. It does, however, increase the problems associated with the design of the core, blanket, and reactor vessel. The compacting of all the equipment into a single vessel reduces the flexibility of mechanical design which the open arrangement allows, as well as intensifying the problems of thermal expansion. The reactor vessel not only becomes larger, but the number of openings is also increased, both of which complicate the vessel design.

23-1. 4 Open arrangements. The open arrangement is the type receiving the most consideration at present because of the flexibility and simplicity of design it affords the system components. Figure 23-2 shows one concept of an externally cooled LMFR using the open-cycle arrangement. In this design, both blanket and core fluids are circulated to heat exchangers located outside the reactor vessel. This type of arrangement also allows greater freedom of design for maintenance of equipment. Means must be provided for removal and/or maintenance of system components under radioactive conditions. The major disadvantage of this arrangement is the high U-Bi inventory.

23-1. 5 Containment and safety requirements. The high negative temperature coefficient and low amount of excess reactivity available make the LMFR inherently stable and safe. However, any rupture of the primary system, whether by reactor excursion or otherwise, would release fission products and polonium to the surrounding atmosphere. The primary system must therefore be surrounded with a secondary vessel for containment of radioactivity in case of such a failure. Since all materials in the reactor core have very low vapor pressures, the containment vessel need not be designed to withstand any appreciable pressure. The containment problem in the LMFR is one of containing the high-temperature liquid metal together with fission products, and such containment can be accomplished by lining the reactor and primary circuit cells with a gastight steel membrane.

The arrangement of the containment vessel also depends on the heat removal design. If an intermediate heat-transfer fluid such as sodium or NaK is used, the containment may be handled as above. If a direct U-Bi to steam cycle is used, a double-wall heat exchanger must be used to maintain double containment unless the entire building is constructed to act as the second containment barrier.

23-1. 7 Maintenance and repair provisions. It is anticipated that a substantial level of activity will be induced in the system by the circulating fuel. This means that the system should be designed so that it can be maintained despite the high radiation level. Several approaches, not mutually exclusive, to this problem are being considered.

All connections between components will be made in one area, fully biologically shielded from the components themselves. When a component is to be removed, its connections are shielded from adjacent connections by portable shielding if the work is to be done directly rather than remotely. The connections are broken, and the shielding is removed above the pipes leading to the component in question. The component is removed with the overhead crane, and a new one set in place. The shielding is replaced, and the connections are remade. Unfortunately, placing all connections in one channel increases the fuel inventory since the piping for this arrangement is somewhat longer than that required for a more conventional arrangement.

In the open-cycle externally cooled, two-fluid LMFR, the bismuth-uranium solution serves as the primary coolant as well as the fuel. In the reactor itself, there is no actual heat transfer. Instead, the solution acts as a transporter of heat to an external heat exchanger. In evaluating bismuth as a primary coolant, it is helpful to make a comparison between it and three other coolants: sodium, a typical alkali metal coolant; LiCl-KCl eutectic, a typical alkali halide salt mixture; and water. The salt eutectic used here would not be a suitable primary coolant for a thermal reactor. Its heat transfer properties, however, are typical of salt coolants.

23-2. 1 Nuclear aspects of coolants. From the nuclear standpoint, five important characteristics of primary reactor coolants are their capacities for (1) absorbing thermal neutrons; (2) slowing down neutrons to the thermal energy level; (3) absorbing gamma radiation; (4) developing induced radioactivity; and (5) resisting radiation damage.

A fluid with a macroscopic cross-section of 9. 0 x 10^- cm² at 450°C has the lowest neutron absorption characteristic of any practical coolant, with the exception of D2O and certain gases. Its reactor poisoning effect is at least an order of magnitude below those of sodium and water. The slowing-down power of Bi is very low, however, which means that when it is used as the primary coolant in a thermal reactor, it contributes very little moderating capacity. The term "No" in Table 23-2 represents the decrease in the natural logarithm of the neutron energy per centimeter of travel. The gamma absorption coefficient, μ, is defined by the equation.

And has the units of cm^+. Values of wu for 450°C Bi at several gamma energies are shown in Table 23-3, along with those for Na and H2O. Bismuth, because of its high density, is an excellent absorber of gamma radiation, which means that it provides considerable internal shielding. The values presented in Table 23-3 are estimates based on the theoretical calculations of Davisson and Evans.

Any accessible volume, due to recoil from its high-energy alpha emission. Thus, spillage of solutions containing Po-210 constitutes a most serious physiological hazard. In the LMFR, however, it is not believed that the presence of Po-210 in the fuel stream creates a more serious radioactivity problem than already exists as a result of the fission products.

Sodium is not free of the radioactivity problem either, but as a primary coolant, it is not as bad in this respect as Bi. Water is comparatively free of induced radioactivity after short holdup times. For the same flux conditions, Na will give over 20,000 times as much radioactivity, on a roentgen basis, as H2O.

23-2. 2 Pumping-power requirements. An important criterion for assessing the relative merits of different coolants is the amount of pumping power required for a fixed rate of heat removal in a given application. The three main pressure drops in the primary coolant circuit are those in the reactor, the external heat exchanger, and the interconnecting piping. The physical properties of the coolants are listed in Table 23-4. The properties of the first three are evaluated at 450°C, as a typical average primary coolant temperature for such coolants, and those for water at 250°C.

The quantity u°-2/pC,28, represented here by the symbol X, is an index of the pumping power required to circulate a coolant through a fixed piping system for a given heat load. Table 23-5 gives relative values of X for the four typical coolants mentioned above. The units and values of the physical properties used in evaluating X are the same as those given in.

The very large spread in pumping power requirements is striking. Bismuth has about four times the pumping power requirements of sodium, and both have manifold greater requirements than that of water, which has the least of any known liquid. The tremendous superiority of water as a heat transport medium is due to its low viscosity and very high volumetric.

23-2. 3 Heat transfer for LMFR. So far as is known, no heat transfer data have been obtained for liquid bismuth. However, several investigators have published experimental heat transfer results on the bismuth-lead eutectic and on mercury. For these results, the Lubarski and Koffman equation expresses the results most closely.

In obtaining the heat transfer coefficients for comparison with bismuth, the sodium coefficients were calculated from the Martinelli-Lyon relationship.

Using the above relationships and assuming: (1) total fixed heat load, (2) fixed diameter of tubes, (3) fixed inlet and outlet temperatures, (4) average bulk temperature of coolants same as in Table 23-4, and (5) combined heat-transfer resistance of tube wall and second fluid equals 0. 001, a typical 23-6 and 23-7 were calculated. Although the heat-transfer characteristics of bismuth are slightly inferior to those for sodium, it is clear from these two sets of calculations that all four coolants behave similarly.

To achieve good thermal contact between bismuth and a solid metal surface, the surface must be cleaned to a high polish; the bismuth must be free of oxide and dissolved gases, and the system must be filled under a high vacuum. Gases or oxides on the heat transfer surface can greatly reduce the heat transfer coefficient for bismuth. Bismuth has a less stable oxide than the oxides of iron, chromium, and nickel, which may be present on the tube surfaces. Hence, the bismuth would have a tendency to non-wet the walls.

23-2. 4 Heat-exchanger design. In a commercial liquid-metal fuel system, the primary bismuth coolant would probably exchange heat with a secondary metal coolant before generating steam. Typical conditions for a 5-MW countercurrent bismuth-sodium heat exchanger are given in.

This section discusses the design and development experience obtained on components required in LMFR systems. Besides the requirements for these systems, considerable component development is needed in the research and development program for experimental apparatus. Both kinds of components are treated here in detail and by case histories.

Fuel Processing Group of Brookhaven National Laboratory required pilot-plant pumps that would circulate uranium-bismuth fuel with absolutely no leakage. The U-Bi fuel was eventually to be circulated through an experimental hole in the Brookhaven reactor where fission products and polonium would be generated. Since a small flow rate of approximately 1 gpm was desired, and efficiency was of little concern, it was decided to use an electromagnetic pump.

An experimental loop was set up to circulate nonradioactive U-Bi by means of a General Electric Model G-3 AC (Faraday) electromagnetic pump. This loop ran continuously for 2400 hours. During the first 160 hours, the rig was operated isothermally at a temperature of 645°F; during the remainder of the time, the loop was run isothermally at 840°F. The U-Bi solution was circulated for most of this period at a rate of 1 gpm. There was no sign of plugging or flow restriction.

The same pump was used to circulate bismuth at 930°F in a 23% Cr-1% Mo steel loop. The efficiency and characteristic curves were somewhat lower than those obtained in a stainless steel loop. This is probably due to short-circuiting of magnetic flux in the ferritic steel walls.

A theoretical study was prepared by the Atomic Energy Research Establishment at Harwell, England for linear induction pumping of bismuth. The report indicates the feasibility of using this type of pump. Linear induction pumps have been built and successfully used at Ames.

Laboratory to circulate Mg-Th eutectic (37 wt% Th) and Bi-U alloy (5 wt% U) in an Inconel-enclosed tantalum loop. The pump operated successfully in the Mg-Th system for 2000 hr at 1470°F with a temperature differential of 210°F. For calibration, about 1 gpm of Bi-U was pumped at 750°F against a head of 0. 5 in. , with an efficiency.

In another experiment, NEPA circulated bismuth with a 50-gpm centrifugal pump for 100 hours at a mean temperature of 1500°F, with a temperature differential of 500°F. An accumulation in the sump of a residue high in oxide content and dissolved elements reduced the flow and forced suspension of operation. This residue probably resulted from an impure inert atmosphere above the liquid metal. The container material selected was AISI type-347 stainless steel, which had shown some promise in bismuth solubility tests at temperatures up to 1800°F.

The California Research and Development Corporation made a survey of the various types of pumps that might be used for liquid bismuth and came to the conclusion that a centrifugal pump would best fit the need. A test unit was built that operated for 1037 hours, and a report stated that the centrifugal pump proved to be a very satisfactory means for circulating bismuth in an isothermal system at 700 to 750°F. This pump and its driver are on a common shaft; the shaft is top-suspended with all bearings in the motor chamber. Space was provided for a labyrinth to separate the pump chamber from the motor chamber, although no seal was used during operation. This pump has also been used to circulate mercury in a test loop at BNL. It has been run successfully for an accumulated time of over 4000 hours.

Brookhaven has developed a totally canned overhung-impeller centrifugal pump. Figure 23-5 shows the major design features of this pump. These units pump 5 to 25 gpm Bi against heads up to 30 ft while operating at 525°C. These sump-type pumps run with no bearings in the liquid metal and have proved reliable so long as sufficient internal baffling is included to stop surface splashing.

The University of California has used a double-volute pump, which is rated at 30 gpm and a 40-ft head at 100°F. The lower bearing is 2 ft above the liquid metal. The pump utilizes a packing gland (Johns-Manville Super Seal No. 6) adjusted to allow helium at 2 psig to leak out of the system at a rate of about 10 ft/hr.

A completely canned, modified Series T-34 MD Duval stainless steel pump was used at the University of California to circulate mercury. The packing gland was replaced with a bushing, and any metal leakage was drained to a reservoir. The pump was driven by a 5-hp, 3-phase induction motor at a shaft speed of 1200 rpm.

North American Aviation, Inc. has circulated tin with a graphite pump compound-wound motor mounted outside the gastight enclosure to avoid the high temperatures. A rotating Graphitar bushing on hardened steel provides the gas seal. The spindle bearings are in a cooled housing. The pump was operated for 500 hours in one run; this was followed by additional runs. To overcome differential thermal expansion, a molybdenum adapter joins the graphite shaft to the stainless steel spindle.

The Allis-Chalmers Manufacturing Co. has built a canned rotor centrifugal pump with fluid piston-type bearings to pump bismuth at 1050°F. The pump is rated at 10 gpm and a head of 25 ft, with an efficiency of 10%. Those parts of the pump in contact with the bismuth are made from AISI type-410 steel. The pump was used in loop G at BNL to pump bismuth at 1020°F with a temperature differential of 300°F. After 15. 5 hr, the pump failed due to scoring of the bearings and seizure of the can by the rotor.

23-3. 2 Valves. The standard-stem packed gate valves used in early NEPA bismuth tests proved that special valves would be required for successful liquid bismuth operation. High leakage rates through the packing caused maintenance difficulties throughout the tests.

A 14-inch Fulton-Sylphon bellows-type stainless steel valve was cycled 1000 times at the rate of 77 times per minute against bismuth at a temperature of 1000°F and a pressure of 25 psig. No failure of the bellows or other valve parts occurred. NEPA also checked valves for metal-to-metal self-welding effects.

The two types of valves which have seen extensive service up to 1050°F in liquid-metal fuel systems are standard Y-pattern globe valves and needle valves. Due to the stringent requirements of zero gas leakage (into or out of the metal systems), the only acceptable stem seal has been a steel bellows. Packings are unacceptable.

Brookhaven National Laboratory has used both types of valves extensively. The 1/2-in. IPS 150-lb Y-pattern globe valves constructed from AISI type-347 stainless steel for all parts in contact with bismuth (including bellows, stem, and disk) have been used continuously for over 8000 hr at 930°F without mishap.

As an additional safety measure, 1/2-inch IPS globe valves used in an in-pile loop at Brookhaven National Laboratory have utilized two sets of bellows. The space between the two bellows was pressurized with inert gas, which was continually monitored to detect pressure changes, thus indicating a valve leak. None was detected.

The valve drives have been modified to facilitate remote operation. The globe valve handwheels are replaced by gears, and these are, in turn, connected to extension rods projecting through the enclosures. Extension rods are welded directly to the needle valve bellows. Universal joints and right-angle gear drives are used for changes in direction between the valve and the operator. When relatively gastight enclosures are desired, as in in-pile loops, the extension rods project through rubber-gasketed compression.

It has been shown at practically all AEC installations that two sections of a circulation system can be isolated from each other by freezing a short section of connecting pipe. This plug can be remelted, and flow resumed after a short wait. This type of seal is undesirable for uranium-bismuth solutions, however, since the uranium will deposit at the cold surface.

Expansion of the pipe when heated from room temperature to operating temperature, and the expansion of bismuth upon freezing (3%). The former condition prescribes the type of supports required, while the latter determines the methods and techniques for freezing the metal.

In general, it is desirable to hang pipes from overhead supports, preferably using spring-loaded hangers with straps around the pipe insulation. Heavy vessels may be anchored to hangers by brackets welded to the wall. Care should be taken to ensure that these brackets do not act as a large heatsink. If the system is supported from below, heavy vessels should "float" by locating them on freely moving bearing raceways.

Freezing the liquid metal in the system, especially in components with bellows, should be avoided. However, in case of emergency, the metal should be frozen towards the free surface. For this reason, a system should always contain a surge (or expansion) tank located at the highest elevation.

The use of an integral fill tank, located at the lowest point in the system to permit charging the loop with metal through a pipe "dip leg," completely immersed in the metal, is recommended. The application of gas pressure on the fill tank will transfer the metal slowly into the loop. By charging the metal from the bottom into a previously evacuated system, gas entrainment will be minimized. A sintered metallic filter should be used to remove oxide and other scum from the metal while filling the loop. This filter should always be located outside the fill tank since this will facilitate the removal of the filter when it becomes clogged and will prevent cracking of the pores if the contents of the fill tank freeze.

The loop may be drained into a vessel, which can be either the fill tank or a separate drain tank. Piping lines should be sloped to facilitate drainage; undrainable pockets should be provided with separate drain lines or, if possible, eliminated.

Bellows. Several types of metal bellows have been used at Brookhaven National Laboratory in bismuth systems at 930°F. IPS globe valves; thick and contain 22 convolutions. At this time, one AISI type-430 steel hydraulically formed bellows used in 1/2-in. IPS globe valves has been bench-cycled with helium over 200,000 times at 1020°F without failure.

Joints. Metal systems. In general, in these metal systems, all joints should be welded for tightness and structural soundness. All weld joints are made by standard inert-arc procedures. Complete procedure specifications have been prepared by BNL for inert-arc welding of AISI type-347 stainless steel pipe, fittings, and vessels for use with liquid metals. This procedure was developed through the cooperation of the Metallurgy Division of Oak Ridge National Laboratory. Specifications have likewise been prepared at BNL for welding 24% Cr-1% Mo steel. AISI type-502 stainless steel to tantalum has been prepared at Ames Laboratory.

Experimental and operating procedures, however, often make it advantageous to have removable joints. These have been successfully used at a number of installations. An oval cross-sectional ring for a flanged joint was used by NEPA in a bismuth system between 520 and 660°F at 300 psig and by the California Research and Development Corporation on 14-in. piping containing bismuth at 700 to 750°F.

Standard metallic ring-joint flanged connections have also been satisfactorily used at the University of California and Brookhaven National Laboratory. The rings were of soft iron (in lead-bismuth systems) and AISI type-347 stainless steel (in bismuth systems).

The ability of liquid metals and liquid salts to leak through extremely small openings has made the use of helium mass spectrometer leak testers a specified test step. Halogen leak testers should never be used because of the absorbed halogen which remains in the surfaces after the tests.

Sight ports have been used to facilitate viewing the liquid metal inside a closed system at the University of California and at Brookhaven National Laboratory. A satisfactory port consists of a glass plate at the end of a steel bellows welded to the pipe. A normally closed butterfly valve isolates the glass from lead or bismuth vapors. The valve is moved by an externally mounted magnet or a handle projecting through.

23-3. 4 Heating equipment. Flexible Nichrome heater wire consisting of a Nichrome inner wire, asbestos, and glass insulation, and a flexible stainless. Figure 23-6 shows the application of this type of heater in loop work. Strip and tubular heaters have been in in-pile service for over 8000 hours. A resistance heater has also been used as an internal heater submerged in a lead-bismuth eutectic system.

Induction heating has been used on bismuth with good results. A heating transformer in which the metal stream is the secondary circuit has been used at Ames Laboratory in magnesium-thorium and uranium-bismuth systems at temperatures up to 1740°F for periods of up to.

23-3. 5 Insulation. Samples of 26 insulating materials were tested for possible reaction with molten bismuth. In general, results indicated that little or no reaction occurred when molten bismuth at 1832°F came into contact with the unheated materials; however, none of the materials would withstand contact with the bismuth for more than a few hours when both were at 1832°F.

In definite concentrations of additives in the fuel systems, the type of container employed, and the condition of the container-liquid interface are of great importance. The presence of oxygen and other impurities in soluble or insoluble form can accelerate the attack upon the container material. As a result, it is desirable to remove all foreign material from liquid-metal fuel systems before charging.

Stainless steels. The committee of stainless steel producers of the American Iron and Steel Institute recommends several techniques, depending upon the type of impurity to be removed. In addition to these methods, BNL has found electropolishing to be useful in removing surface oxides. In all cases, after the use of cleaning solutions, the material is rinsed thoroughly with water and dried by allowing a final alcohol or acetone rinse to evaporate.

Low-chrome steels. Several methods have been used for cleaning metals of this type. One method is described for PbBi systems in which boiling detergent solution is used to remove dirt and scale, followed by a distilled water rinse and drying under conditions of heat and vacuum. The same reference describes the following cleaning procedure.

Leak testing: Liquid-metal fuel systems that involve solutions containing uranium and oxygen-sensitive additives (such as the magnesium used in LMFR systems) require precautions to prevent air leakage into equipment. In general, a sequence of leak detection is followed in which gross leakage and structural faults are first eliminated by pressure testing. Suspected leaks can be verified by the application of soap solution.

Preheating: A procedure for preheating equipment has been used at BNL and elsewhere in which the equipment is first evacuated to less than 100 microns pressure and then heated at a rate slow enough to prevent pressure surges above 100 microns to operating temperature. This procedure has the advantage of removing condensables from the container walls before they can react with the wall at elevated temperatures.

With the equipment at or above operating temperature, purified hydrogen may be introduced to reduce any surface oxide that might be present. This step is frequently done with the liquid metal present in the charging vessel in order to reduce oxides present in the charge.

Charging procedures. The procedures described here are specific for the preparation of LMFR fuel solutions, but they are at the same time somewhat typical of the handling techniques necessary for other liquid-metal fuel systems that have been suggested. Basically, the procedures result from the need for maintaining system cleanliness, stability of additives, minimum oxygen contamination, and uniformity of solutions.

Bismuth preparation. Bismuth ingots are cut to a size suitable for loading, and surface oxide deposits are mechanically removed. The metal is then charged to a melt tank and heated to the charging temperature under vacuum. Zirconium and magnesium, in the appropriate amounts, are suspended in the melt to establish the proper concentrations of additives. Samples are taken to verify this. When the concentrations of the additives are stable, the bismuth is considered satisfactory for charging to the test.

Equipment charging: The bismuth from the charging vessel is forced, by inert gas pressure, through a porous metal filter to remove oxides and into a sump tank in the test equipment. From this tank, the metal can be raised by gas pressure into the operating sections of the equipment.

In addition to flowing bismuth, the addition of uranium, magnesium, and zirconium to flowing streams is accomplished by inserting a steel basket containing the additive into the bismuth stream through a sampling port. Initial uranium additions to a system are not made until sampling has shown that the concentrations of magnesium and zirconium are stable.

PPM range of concentration. KAPL and Oak Ridge have developed techniques for this analysis, and commercial units have also been developed for use in this range. At BNL, the purity of gas is checked by passing it over a polished uranium chip at 550 to 600°C. If the chip is not tarnished, the gas is considered suitable for use.

Conditioning operation. In addition to the system preparation steps described in previous sections, it has been found desirable to provide a period of system operation in which a corrosion-inhibiting layer of zirconium nitride can be formed on the container walls. In general, this is done by charging the system with bismuth to which zirconium and magnesium have already been added, and then operating the system isothermally until analyses have shown the additive concentrations to be stable.

Sampling. Thief-type samplers have been used almost exclusively for liquid-metal fuel systems. Sampling in this manner is accomplished by inserting a sample tube into the metal through an airlock mounted above the vessel. The airlock is separated from the vessel chamber by a full-opening ball valve. By bubbling helium through a hole near the bottom of the sample tube, it is possible to control the depth at which the sample is taken. At the time of sampling, the pressure inside and outside the tube is equalized, and the liquid enters the tube, which is then withdrawn.

This method is shown in Section 7. A variation of this technique has been adapted for taking filtered samples. An inverted sample cup, which has been closed at one end by a filter, is lowered into the metal stream and filled by increasing the system pressure. Another variation involves the use of a sliding valve on the sample tube. This valve is opened and closed by a rotary bellows-sealed drive that controls the time at which the sample is taken. Radioactive samples have been taken using thief-sampler techniques. The activity levels encountered were not high enough to require remote manipulation, but dry box techniques were necessary to protect against alpha contamination.

Corrosion study samples are used extensively in developmental systems and consist of carefully prepared and examined metal or graphite pieces, which are included in the system piping during fabrication and removed after each experimental run. Samples have also been inserted into flowing streams through thief-sampler airlocks to study corrosion effects and interactions between the sample and fuel stream components.

A line-type sampler, in which the liquid-metal stream is drawn through a sample line to a sample container, is shown in Figure 8. In this device, small cups may be filled in succession and then withdrawn through the airlock. The sampler is manipulated externally by the pinion gear.

High-temperature radiography techniques have been developed for radiographing operating bismuth systems at elevated temperatures. These techniques aim to study plug formation, gross corrosion effects, and operating characteristics such as liquid levels and gas entrainment, utilizing gamma-ray sources.

In making welds, any surface deposit of bismuth must be removed before a successful weld can be assured. Removal of a part of the inner pipe wall by reaming has been found necessary. Cooling coils placed on the pipe at the end of the reamed section will keep bismuth from melting and flowing into the weld.

In cases where bismuth fuels have undergone neutron irradiation, proper protection against polonium contamination must be provided. It has been found that polonium and nonvolatile fission products contained in solid bismuth can be handled without little difficulty, since they are largely immobilized by the bismuth. Repairs of contaminated equipment, including welding operations, have been made without hazard.

Experience at Brookhaven National Laboratory has shown that the most successful method for providing both good insulation and a satisfactory high-temperature seal in a single-level probe is by the use of automotive spark plugs. It is suggested that the seal be removed from direct contact with the heat source by means of an appropriate pipe extension. A probe can be welded to the spark plug after removal of the bent side electrode. The probes may be made from AISI types-347 and 502 steel for bismuth systems or of tungsten in a tin system. The external circuit consists of a transformer, relay, and indicating lights. By the use of two probes and interlocked relays, it is possible to indicate a level beneath the lower probe, between probes, or above the upper probe.

The movable probe, consisting of the proper metal rod or tube, is adjusted through a suitable compression fitting. Modified Parker fittings and Wilson fittings with Teflon packing glands are recommended. The liquid level is determined by comparing the probe height with a previously calibrated scale.

The variable inductance probe consists of a doubly wound coil in a ceramic form. The coil is inserted into a pipe well inside the tank, and as the liquid-metal level rises, the inductance of the coil changes. The change of inductance is detected in a bridge circuit, with the degree of unbalance being a measure of the level. This method has the advantage, especially important in handling radioactive fluids, that the system is hermetically sealed at all times.

If it is not possible to utilize the fluid itself for level indication, the liquid level may be obtained in a roundabout manner by means of a stainless steel float. A stainless steel tube long enough to protrude from the tank is attached to the float. A short length of cold-rolled steel rod is contained in the uppermost section, which is completely enclosed so that no liquid can come in contact with it.

The seal pot measuring devices are simple to construct and have been used most extensively in this work. The pressure is transmitted from the metal to a trapped inert gas that is monitored by a conventional gas-pressure gauge. This inert gas maintains a constant metal level in the seal pots, as determined by means of a float or spark plug probes. The float (with an extension rod) or the High-Low spark plug probes actuate solenoid valves connected to gas supply and vent lines. The probe separation is 1/4 in. , thereby regulating the liquid level to +1/8 in. Since there is no barrier between metal and gas, metal may splash into the gas space and freeze the gas lines. This may be partly alleviated by providing long vertical gas lines, a means of heating these lines, and.

The pneumatic pilot-operated pressure transmitter can be made to be very sensitive with rapid response. A thin metallic bellows seals the unit and is the sensing element. The full-range bellows movement is only a few thousandths of an inch. The backing gas is nitrogen, and the sensing system is adjusted to maintain a maximum differential of 10 psig across the bellows. One of the difficulties with this type of element is the incomplete drainage of Bi from the convolutions of the bellows. This trapped Bi may rupture the bellows when it freezes. Another disadvantage is its large consumption of instrument gas.

Another type of pressure transmitter utilizes a bellows-sealed differential transformer. The sensing element of this transmitter is similar to that of the previous unit and consists of a metallic bellows. A matching transformer, installed in a bridge circuit, allows a calibrated instrument to indicate or record the actual pressure in the system.

From a NaK capillary system that extends from the diaphragm chamber to a bourdon tube in a conventional pressure transmitter, capillary lengths up to 20 ft allow the transmitter to be placed remotely with respect to the system. The other diaphragm style consists of two thin sheets of metal welded together to form an envelope. The inside of the envelope contains NaK and is connected to a bourdon element by a length of capillary tubing. The envelope diaphragm is suspended in the Bi in an all-welded container. This type of transmitter has proved to be reliable in the pressure range between 10 and 175 psig.

Flow measurement: Orifice. The flow of liquid-metal fuels, much like flows of water or other liquids, is most commonly measured with standard orifices. Work done at the Engineering Research Center, University of California has demonstrated that an orifice may be calibrated with water, and the calibration may then be used directly for heavy metal (Bi or Pb-Bi) flow metering. The error introduced in this manner is only between 3 and 5%.

Orifice assemblies have generally been installed in the piping systems with ring-joint and flange connections. One-piece orifice plate and metallic O-rings are used. Either flange or vena contracta taps are used, and the pressure is measured as indicated in the previous section. Mild steel orifice plates with sharp-edged holes are satisfactory for use in lead-bismuth; there was no detectable erosion in one such orifice.

A submerged orifice made from 24% Cr-1 Mo steel has been successfully used at Brookhaven National Laboratory in over 4000 hours of operation with bismuth at 1020°F. Its special appeal lies in the fact that liquid levels (heads) instead of pressures are measured. Ordinary liquid level probes are.

Electromagnetic flowmeter. A permanent magnet is mounted around the pipe through which molten metal is flowing, with the faces of the magnet creating a field perpendicular to the pipe. Two leads are welded to the pipe wall, mutually perpendicular to both the pipe and magnetic flux. The emf generated by the molten metal when cutting the lines of flux is picked up by these leads and can be transmitted to any potential-sensitive instrument. The theoretical analysis of this type of flowmeter agrees within 67% with.

Preliminary results have shown that these flowmeters may also be used in a 23% Cr-1% Mo steel system. However, corrections must be made for the short-circuiting of magnetic flux in the ferritic steel pipe walls. One way of minimizing this correction might be to use a bimetallic cell, that is, a thin (0. 010 in. ) liner of 24% Cr-1% Mo steel surrounded by an AISI type-347 stainless steel pipe to provide structural strength.

Temperature measurement. The temperature of liquid metal fuels is typically measured with thermocouples of duplex Chromel-Alumel, No. 20 BWG gauge. Each wire is individually insulated with fiberglass and asbestos, and each pair is covered again with insulation.

The best and most accurate service in low-chrome or stainless steel systems is obtained by welding the thermocouple junction directly to the outside of the pipe wall. The difference between the temperature on the pipe wall and the bulk bismuth at 930°F is no greater than 10°F. If required, thermocouples located in wells have also been used in bismuth.

Temperature control for isothermal loops is obtained as follows. The various parts of the loop are heated by means of individual heater circuits. Since the current demand varies depending on the position of the heater in the loop, the current to the heaters is adjusted by means of individual autotransformers on each circuit. The entire heater group is supplied from a single line whose voltage varies according to the signal supplied to a controller by a single, centrally located thermocouple. The voltage is varied by means of a transformer whose primary is in the feed line. While the loop temperature remains within the neutral band around the set point of the controller, the secondary coil circuit is closed. If the temperature drops below the neutral band, the relay opens the secondary coil circuit, thus decreasing the inductance of the primary and increases the voltage to the heaters. If the temperature rises above the neutral band, the controller relay opens the main circuit breaker and cuts off current.

In Chapter 18, the two-fluid and the single-fluid externally cooled LMFR concepts were discussed in a general way. It was pointed out that the two-fluid design has the better breeding possibilities but is somewhat more complex than the single-fluid reactor. In this chapter, a complete design study of a two-fluid full-sized LMFR reactor is described and discussed, and a shorter discussion of a single-fluid design study follows. This does not mean that one design is necessarily favored over the other. In fact, both of these designs are being studied very extensively.

24-2. 1 General description. The two-fluid externally cooled LMFR concept consists of a relatively small core surrounded, for the most part, by a blanket containing fertile material. The core is composed of high-density, impervious graphite through which vertical channels are drilled to allow circulation of the fuel coolant. The fuel in the core is dissolved U-235 or U-238 dissolved and suspended in liquid bismuth. The fluid fuel also acts as a coolant for the core system.

The blanket is constructed of high-density graphite, through which flows a liquid bismuth slurry containing the bred U83 fuel and thorium, the fertile material. In this study, thorium is assumed to be suspended in bismuth as thorium bismuthide, although thorium oxide particles could be used. The blanket is wrapped around the core as completely as possible for good neutron economy. An important economic consideration is the degree of end blanketing that can be achieved while keeping coolant velocities below the allowable limit. Several blanket designs were investigated, but a complete study for obtaining the best end blanket design has not yet been carried out.

Total power 825 MW (thermal). Coolant to moderator ratio in core, Vp1/Vo 1. 22. 50. Core-blanket barrier material: graphite. Blanket thickness: 3. 0 ft. Blanket slurry composition: Bismuth 90 wt% Thorium, as ThsBis 10 wt%. Coolant inlet temperature: 750°F. Coolant outlet temperature: 1050°F.

The several factors that dictated the choice of a bismuth-to-carbon volume ratio merit some attention. There are some losses of neutrons due to capture in graphite. Hence, one would wish to use only enough graphite to sufficiently thermalize the reactor. If too little graphite is used, the critical mass will be large. It is suspected that the n value for U33 may be lower in the epithermal than in the thermal energy range. 22, and consequently, this core assumes a cylinder with its height equal to diameter.

Blanket slurry-to-graphite volume ratio and blanket thickness: A series of calculations were made to estimate the most economical parameter values for the blanket. Figures 24-2 and 24-3 demonstrate the effects of varying blanket composition and thickness on breeding ratio. 5, and the blanket thickness was set.

24-2. 3 End blanket effects. A series of nuclear calculations was performed to determine the effects of end blanket design upon the breeding ratio. With a height equal to 1. 5 times the diameter, a 3-ft radial blanket, and no end blanket, critical values of fuel concentrations and breeding ratio were calculated for four power fractions in the blanket for each design.

All calculations were performed for hot, clean conditions with an average temperature of 900°F. A two-group, multi-region code was used to solve the diffusion equations, and a 37-group spectral code was used to determine the two-group nuclear constants. The results of these calculations are completely eliminating the end blankets. This is due primarily to the added neutron leakage out the ends of the core, despite the fact that the core height is increased. Although the critical mass of fuel in the core is higher without end blankets, the fuel concentration is somewhat lower due to the increased core volume.

The actual core and blanket design are between the two extremes assumed in these calculations. The blanket can be extended beyond the end boundaries of the core, and a graphite reflector can cover the ends of the core except for the coolant inlet and outlet. Cooling becomes a serious design.

Problem, if the end reflector is replaced with blanket material, the design in -4 is a substantial improvement over no end blanket or reflector. However, further improvement in breeding ratio could be achieved with even better end blanket designs.

24-2. 4 Power level in the blanket. For a given geometry, coolant-to-moderator ratio, and thorium concentration in the blanket, specification of the fraction of total fissions generated in the blanket establishes a unique set of values for fuel concentration in the blanket, fuel concentration in the core, and fissions generated in the core. For simplicity, the power generated in a region is assumed to be directly proportional to the fissions in that region. The data in Table 24-1 indicate that the breeding ratio changes very little with large changes in the fraction of total power generated in the blanket. This increase in blanket power results in an increased ratio of resonance to thermal absorptions, a phenomenon which tends to offset the additional fast neutron leakage out of the blanket as blanket power increases.

An economic analysis of the effects of changing the blanket power fraction was performed to determine the optimum core-blanket power split under equilibrium operating conditions. The parameters affecting this choice are: (1) fission-product poison levels in the blanket, (2) fission-product poison levels in the core, and (3) chemical processing costs.

If the blanket processing cycle is determined by the minimum removal rate of U33 for steady-state operation, a corresponding poison level in the blanket is automatically set.

Chemical processing cycle for blanket slurry. The chemical processing was assumed to be performed continuously on the reactor site. Unless otherwise specified, the fluoride volatility process is utilized as described in Article 24-3. 16.

Z = removal efficiency for uranium = 0. 04; M8 = mass of fuel in blanket system, kg; b/a = ratio of Pa%3 to U3 in blanket; B = kg of fuel burned per Mwd = 1. 05(1 + a3); P = total power, 825 Mw; BR = breeding ratio; Pz = blanket power, Mw.

The poison level in the blanket depends on 7z, and 7g is a function of MB, b/a, breeding ratio, and power fraction in the blanket. All these variables are interrelated. The ratio b/a is a function of Tz, but Ts is a breeding ratio is a slowly varying function of fission-product levels in the blanket due to the heavy loading of fuel and thorium in that region. The breeding ratio is sensitive to the poison level, and thus to the chemical processing rate in the core fuel solution.

For a given chemical processing rate in the blanket, the fission-product poison level was determined from the data in KAPL 1226. Xenon and samarium are treated separately and are not included in the term fission products. The burnup, F, in a region is defined as the atoms of fuel fissioned per atom present in the region. The burnup F at time T in the blanket is calculated.

Using this relation, the relative positioning in the blanket was determined for each processing cycle from a graph of RP versus F. The RP curve used is based on high cross sections of all fission products, with the exception of a low value for Zr3.

Xenon in the blanket. Xenon is removed from the blanket by the degasser. Although the removal rate of fission-product gases cannot be determined until experimental information becomes available, a poison fraction of 0. 01 was assumed for Xe-135.

Fission-product poisons in the core: The level of fission products (FP), other than xenon and samarium, in the core is determined by the chemical processing cycle for the core fuel solution.

Economic optimization: An optimization study was conducted to determine the most economical power split between core and blanket systems and fission-product poison level for the core during equilibrium operation. The fuel cost items that vary with these two parameters are (1) bismuth inventory, (2) fuel inventory, (3) fuel burnup, (4) thorium amortization, (5) thorium burnup, and (6) chemical processing. Nuclear calculations specified the fuel concentrations for both core and blanket and breeding ratios.

Since only a relative comparison was needed, all calculations were made with a spherical core and a complete 3-ft spherical blanket. The xenon poison fraction was taken as 0. 01, and the samarium steady-state value was computed for each region in each case.

The fission product poison level in the blanket cannot be determined without first knowing the blanket processing cycle. As a first approach, the breeding ratio for the hot clean conditions was used to determine the cycle time from which the RP in the blanket was calculated, as described previously. The relative poison levels determined on this basis were as.

All criticality calculations were performed using the specifications outlined in Article 24-2. 2. Two-group diffusion theory was employed, and a two-group, multi-region code was used for solving the diffusion equations. As previously mentioned, a 37-group spectral code was used to generate the two-group coefficients. The critical concentration of fuel in the core and blanket, breeding ratio, and neutron losses were determined for several power splits for each relative poison level in the core. The blanket power fraction values of 10, 33. 3, and 50% were used as reference values for comparison, and the important nuclear parameters were determined from a set of parametric curves for these precise values. (Cases actually calculated corresponded very closely to the desired blanket power in most calculations. ).

The nuclear parameters corresponding to these power splits are summarized in Table 24-2. Figures 24-5 and 24-6 show the variation of No23/Nxi in both the core and blanket as the blanket power fraction changes. This atom ratio of U% to bismuth in the blanket ranges from No23/Nxi ratio decreases approximately 20% over the same range.

Bismuth inventory. The primary system volumes for Ps/P = 0. 33 and 0. 50 are based on a six-loop capsule design. Each loop contains a bismuth inventory of 245 ft. If 50% of the power is generated in the blanket, three loops contain blanket slurry, and three contain U-Bi core solution. If one-third of the power originates in the blanket, two loops are devoted to the blanket system and four to the core system. The reactor holdup has been estimated from the reactor drawing in Fig. 24-4. Fuel inventory volumes are summarized in Table 24-3.

Vis = inventory volume of core system, ft; Vos = inventory volume of blanket system, ft. Fuel inventory: Five days holdup of fuel from both blanket and core is assumed for the chemical processing plant. Pa is held up for 135 days to allow for decay to U33. Approximately 3% of the Pa remains after 135 days and is discarded with the fission-product waste. This loss, while.

Chemical processing costs. The processing rate for the core system is determined by the method also described previously. The total throughput to the fluoride volatility chemical separations plant is.

As a matter of comparison, the chemical processing charges were also computed for each case, assuming on-site aqueous processing methods. The capacity and cost of an aqueous processing plant are determined by the amount of thorium per day which must be processed. The core solution processing does not enter into the cost unless the ratio of fuel to thorium presents criticality problems in the process equipment. This situation is likely to occur for the higher power levels in the blanket. This analysis did not take this possibility into account; however, and annual aqueous processing costs were taken directly from -12. This design plant capacity is 35 kg/day of thorium feed.

Chemical processing costs drop rapidly as the power fraction in the blanket increases. The increased processing rate required to maintain a steady-state fission-product relative poison level in the core of 0. 03 results in a processing cost much higher than required for RP values greater than 0. 09. The aqueous processing costs appear to become essentially equal to fluoride volatility costs at a value of 50% for Pg/P.

Sadly, the text provided seems to be a mix of random characters and symbols without any coherent meaning or structure. As there is no identifiable text to correct in terms of spelling or punctuation errors, I will return the input as it is.

The total power in the blanket system and the relative poisons in the sphere must be considered when establishing new specifications. Effects of higher uranium isotopes, Pa losses, and control rods on the breeding ratio must be taken into account. A new chemical processing cycle for the blanket, along with a new fission-product poison level in the blanket, must be calculated based on the adjusted breeding ratio.

Geometry effects. The inability to wrap a blanket around the ends of the core requires an adjustment to the parameters for the reference design based on the calculations with a full blanket. The axial leakage out of a blanket length and the addition of partial end graphite reflectors are estimated to reduce the end leakage to one-half this value. The total neutron leakage, both fast and thermal, out of the partially blanketed reactor is estimated at 0. 17 neutrons per absorption in fuel.

The added length of core and blanket will slightly increase the critical mass, but the required N23/Nx ratio will decrease slightly. In order to be conservative in the fuel inventory costs, however, the critical values of N03/Nxi for the fully blanketed sphere are assumed for both core and.

Chemical plant. The relative poison due to these isotopes, however, rises rapidly at first with the buildup of U% but increases very slowly thereafter. The return from U fissions almost balances for losses to U4 and U86. An average poison fraction of 0.

24-3. 1 General. Systems design covers all of the reactor plant external to the reactor, except for chemical processing. The reactor plant includes the steam generator, but not the steam system or its auxiliaries. The principal purpose of the systems is to transport heat from the reactor and generate steam. They also provide supporting functions, such as shield cooling, uranium addition, etc.

The primary system consists of six heat transport loops, each consisting of a pump, a heat exchanger, a check valve, and interconnecting piping. The hot-leg temperature is 1050°F, and the cold-leg temperature is 750°F. In each of the intermediate heat exchangers, heat is transferred from the bismuth to the intermediate fluid, sodium.

The temperature approach of the intermediate heat exchanger was set at 40°F, resulting in a sodium hot-leg temperature of 1010°F. To provide the close approach necessary for steam temperature stability, the steam temperature was set at 1000°F. A steam pressure of 2100 psig was chosen to correspond with 1000°F.

Shifting the sodium cold-leg temperature redistributes heat transfer surface between the intermediate heat exchanger and the steam generator.

24-3. 2 Plant arrangement. Plant arrangement starts with positioning the primary system relative to the reactor, and this is determined by seven principal considerations: (1) reactor design, (2) plant operation, (3) maintenance, (4) operational limitations of major components, (5) structural integrity of piping, (6) economics, and (7) safety.

A preliminary analysis of the two reactor concepts, single-fluid and two-fluid, resulted in the decision to use three external loops for the single-fluid and six for the two-fluid reactor. For both these alternatives, the maintenance philosophy selected was that of removal and replacement by horizontal transfer of a complete primary loop upon failure of any major component in the loop. Thus, for arrangement purposes, the primary loops assume the shape of a rail-mounted horizontal containment vessel, or capsule, sized to contain all loop components. The height of the capsules relative to the reactor is dictated by an economic balance between height or elevation costs and pump net positive suction head.

In plan, the primary loops were located radially around the reactor. A minimum length of interconnecting pipe between the reactor and the loops was used because of high fuel inventory costs. Maintenance access doors and other shielding around the outside of the loops were sized for source conditions 6 to 8 hours after shutdown of the reactor to permit access by maintenance personnel at that time into the annular area.

With the primary loop arrangement established, the next problem was the location of the intermediate system. Since this system is the connecting link between the primary systems and the steam turbines, it must be located between them. The turbine is above ground level for gravity drainage of condenser cooling water, and the primary loops are below ground level for the economy of shield costs.

Because the primary loop hot maintenance shop for this concept serves such specialized functions, its usefulness for maintenance of chemical processing equipment is doubtful.

Startup heating switchgear, gas heating, and cooling systems for the reactor and dump tanks; inert gas storage systems; control rooms; and other auxiliaries are located relative to the above systems as logically as possible in the light of their functional requirements.

The fuel stream enters the bottom portion of the reactor vessel at a minimum bulk temperature of 750°F and flows upward through the core where fissions within the fuel cause the fluid to undergo a temperature rise of 300°F, resulting in a maximum fuel temperature of 1050°F. Upon leaving the core, the fluid passes upward to a degassing area where volatile fission products are removed from the fuel stream. The reactor discharge consists of a header that splits the fuel flow into the primary heat-transport loops.

From the degassing area discharge, each fuel stream flows to the suction of a variable-speed centrifugal sump-type pump. Each pump is designed to deliver about 9000 gpm at a 20-ft head of pumped fluid. To obtain a reasonable pump speed, the net positive suction head requirement is 11. 5 ft. A gas pressure (helium) is maintained over the pump sump to prevent flooding of upper parts (motor windings, cooling system, etc. ).

From the pump discharge, the fuel stream flows to the tube side of a U-tube, U-shell intermediate heat exchanger in which the fuel stream gives up heat to the intermediate fluid, sodium. Upon discharge from the intermediate heat exchanger, the fuel solution flows into the reactor.

To meet safety requirements, the reactor and the major components of the primary loops are enclosed within containment vessels. The containment vessel, which houses the pump and heat exchanger of each primary loop, is a cylindrical capsule, 20 ft in diameter by 30 ft long, including a 2:1 vessel for maintenance operations.

Each heat-transport loop is provided with four dump tanks, which receive the loop and a portion of the reactor volumes. The tanks are sized and arranged to prevent a fast chain reaction. The primary loops are filled from the dump tanks by means of small electromagnetic pumps. These pumps also promise a means for agitation of the fuel.

24-3. 4 Intermediate system. The intermediate system, which also consists of six separate heat transfer loops, utilizes sodium as the heat transfer medium. The steam generator, which is designed for high-pressure, high-temperature service, is constructed of type 304 stainless steel. The intermediate piping (12-in. schedule 30) is sized for a maximum sodium velocity of 17 fps.

Tubes with an average length of 21 ft, at 680°F, flow countercurrent to the fuel stream and exit from the heat exchanger. Sodium flows to the suction of a variable-speed centrifugal sump-type pump. Each intermediate pump is designed to deliver 11,000 gpm at a 180-ft head.

From pump discharge, sodium flows to the shell side of the steam generator. The steam generator is a U-tube, U-shell once-through type unit constructed of type-304 stainless steel. The unit consists of 530 1/2-inch-OD tubes with an average length of 65 ft. The shell OD is 29 in. and the overall length is 68 ft.

In addition to the components listed above, auxiliary components are necessary to obtain proper function of the intermediate system. An expansion tank is located at the highest point of each intermediate loop. This tank serves as a cushion for pressure surges, a surge vessel for thermal expansion of sodium, and suction head for the pumps. Sodium is replaced in the loop by a small electromagnetic pump, which takes suction from the bottom of the dump tank. A plugging indicator and a cold trap are provided to determine sodium oxide concentration and to maintain the oxide concentration at low levels.

In the event fission-product "hangup" occurs in the intermediate heat exchanger, fission product activity will generate heat within the metal. To prevent excessive metal temperatures, cooling must be provided when the unit is drained. This cooling is accomplished by providing removable sections of insulation which, when removed, will permit heat to be dissipated by radiation, conduction, and convection heat transfer. Flow control of the intermediate system will be by the variable-speed pump drives. This method of control should provide a reasonably constant steam temperature.

When, for any reason, it becomes desirable to shut down the reactor and dump the primary system, reactor cooling must be provided to remove decay heat generated by fission-product hangup within the reactor after dump. This is necessary to prevent internal temperatures from exceeding design limits. The system as just described provides cooling by opening a valve to bring a finned tube helium-to-water heat exchanger into the cycle and by closing a stop valve to remove the gas heater from the gas flow.

Helium system design pressure and temperature will be 5 psig and 1050°F. The entire loop is of all-welded construction to minimize helium leakage and prevent the leakage of volatile fission products should a rupture of the reactor vessel or piping give volatile fission products access to this loop.

24-3. 6 Dump tank heating and cooling. When fuel is drained from the primary system into the dump tanks, fission-product decay produces heat within the fuel, which must be removed to prevent dump tank metal temperatures from exceeding design limits.

Cooling is accomplished by circulating helium at 140 psig through a narrow annulus around each dump tank. Helium, which has removed heat from the dump tanks, passes through a finned-tube heat exchanger and gives up heat to river water. Circulation of helium is provided by six 14,000 cfm blowers, each rated to provide a head of 18 in. water. Three standby blowers are also provided. Helium piping is arranged such that four dump tanks are serviced by one blower.

To preheat the dump tanks and to maintain their temperature at a level such that fuel precipitation does not occur, electric heaters are paralleled with the heat exchanger, such that the same piping system serves for heating or cooling. The heaters or heat exchangers may be brought into or taken off the cycle by valving.

24-3. 7 Startup heating system. Prior to power operation, the LMFR heat-transport system must be preheated to about 800°F. The reactor and the primary dump tanks are preheated by electric furnaces and circulating intermediate heat exchanger, intermediate piping, dump tanks, expansion tanks, steam generator, and the steam system pipe and components are preheated by induction heaters.

Helium, by virtue of its very low activation cross-section and inertness, is utilized as the cover and seal gas for the primary system. It is stored at 200 psig in a storage tank and is piped via pressure-reducing valves to the pump, dump tanks, and reactor. Since relatively small quantities of helium will be used, it is expected that waste helium will be discharged via the off-gas system to the stack.

243. 10 Shield cooling. The concrete surrounding the primary cells serves as a shield from the neutrons and gammas leaving the primary fluid. To hold temperatures and thermal gradients within the concrete to reasonable limits, a cooling system must be utilized. This cooling system consists of panel coils embedded about 6 in. High-purity water, flowing inside the panel coils, removes heat from the concrete and prevents temperature damage to the concrete.

The closed, high-purity loop, which rejects heat to river water, is designed for a maximum heat load of 6 MW. One pump of 900 gpm capacity provides circulation for the closed water loop. Flow control valves proportion the flow to the various panels such that panel coil outlet temperatures are.

A dump tank for the closed loop (about 300 ft³) is located beneath the panel coils so that the coils may be gravity-drained. Water is returned to the closed loop by means of gas pressure. In the event it is necessary to dispose of the water in the closed loop, it may be drained from the dump tank to the radioactive waste disposal system.

To the containment vessel, helium, which fills the containment vessel, is circulated by a blower located within the cooling unit.

Ventilation is provided by locating air intake louvers at several points around the room. An air fan provides circulation of air around the capsules and removes heat, which is discharged to the stack. A radiation monitor continuously monitors the air discharge. In the event radiation tolerance levels are exceeded by the air discharge, the cooling air will be recirculated to the reactor and capsule room until the source of radiation is determined.

24-3. 13 Raw water system. The raw water system is the final waste heat sink for the entire plant. River water, which is screened and treated, is piped beneath the turbine-generator building. The systems that require river water, i. e. , turbine condenser, shield cooling, reactor cooling, dump tank, and pump cooling, take suction from this pipe and discharge to a similar one that returns the heated water to the river. Where possible, river water flows tube-side in heat exchangers to facilitate cleaning.

24-3. 14 Instrumentation and control. The purpose of the control system in this plant is to provide safe and stable operation while following the loads imposed by the utility system. The plant follows the turbo generator. Loads on the turbo generator are set by the utility.

A load change will appear in the steam system as a change in throttle valve position and, therefore, a change in steam flow and pressure. The feedwater controllers at the inlet to the steam generators will sense these changes and operate to maintain steam pressure constant. The steam flow could also provide an anticipatory signal to the primary and intermediate system pumps to change their speed to suit the load.

The reactor will have a negative temperature coefficient of reactivity. Thus, it will try to maintain its average temperature constant during load changes. The temperature will change from time to time as reactivity changes.

Programming of flow rate in the primary and intermediate loop is uncertain. Cost estimates for pumps and control equipment were based on the premise that the speed of the pumps would be varied; this might be necessary to avoid thermal stresses during transients.

24-3. 15 Maintenance. The maintenance of the reactor and primary system components will be completely remote because of the high levels of radioactivity of the circulating fuel. The entire plant and reactor system is arranged for remote maintenance.

24-3. 16 Chemical processing. The pyro process chosen for this economic study is the fluoride volatility method applied to a two-region reactor. Work of adapting this process to bismuth fuel processing is presently underway at Argonne National Laboratory. Figure 24-18 presents the main steps in this process. As shown, the process may be used for either blanket or core liquid.

The volatility method can be conveniently used to process a thorium bismuthide blanket. The modification of the core liquid process flowsheet is as follows: (1) salt effluent from the hydrofluorination step must be stored to achieve Pa decay to uranium, and (2) the bismuth liquid is returned to the blanket head-end process without the addition of uranium.

Certain of the fission products are not removed by volatility processing. These may be removed by zinc precipitation (-20). This process requires that the bismuth feed be free of uranium, and the volatility plant provides such a bismuth feed stream.

The head-end process transfers bred uranium, protactinium, and fission products out of the solid-phase portion of the slurry and into the liquid phase. After this step, the two phases are partially separated. The stripped liquid bismuth is returned to the head-end plant for mixing with fresh slurry. Protactinium is not completely removed from the slurry before reconstitution and return to the blanket region. This problem has been examined in some detail and was taken into account in determining economics.

The generator has a gross output of 333,000 electrical kW, and the condenser's gross heat rate is 8450 Btu/kWh. About 18,000 kW of electrical power is used for the various pumps and auxiliary systems in the plant, making the net output 315,000 kW. Therefore, the net heat rate is 8940 Btu/kWh, which corresponds to an efficiency of 38. 2%.

At full load, there are 1,825,500 lb/hr of steam leaving the turbine and being condensed in the condenser. Additionally, 113,800 lb/hr of water from various parts of the cycle are being cooled by the condenser. The total head load on the condenser is 1. 677 x 10^6 Btu/hr. The condenser cooling water enters one water box at 70°F and exits the other at 80°F.

The off-gas system will consist of a cooler followed by a series of storage bottles. Gaseous fission products that have been separated from the liquid bismuth in the degasser are first sent through a cooler, which offers a residence time of about a day, or enough for most of the short-lived isotopes to decay. From the cooler, the gases are compressed into storage bottles, each capable of holding 30 days' accumulation. The storage bottles will each be 4. 25 ft³ in volume and at 212°F and 60 psia at the time of disconnection from the compressor.

Some sweep gas may be included in the above gas stream, but the present design philosophy indicates that no extra sweep gas should be required. However, if some sweep gas is required for efficient degasser operation, this gas could be obtained by a recycle of previously removed gas. This recycle sweep stream would most probably be taken from the storage bottles after.

The gas in the storage bottles may be vented to the atmosphere after 90 days of storage, since then only the Kr activity is still present in appreciable amounts, and this can be released provided there is sufficient dilution. However, the most probable course of action will be to process the stored off-gas through a gas separation system, where the valuable Kr will be recovered.

244. 1 General description. The single-fluid LMFR concept has been investigated to determine the characteristics and economic attractiveness of this design. In general, the core consists of a large array of solid moderator blocks stacked to provide the desirable geometry of a cylinder. Vertical cylindrical channels are drilled through the moderator to allow circulation of the liquid metal slurry containing both the fuel and fertile material. The fission heat generated in the fuel-coolant stream is transported by forced convection to heat exchangers external to the reactor vessel. The unique feature of this concept is that only one coolant, the slurry, is used for removing heat from all parts of the reactor. The desired slurry-to-moderator ratio is achieved by selecting the appropriate combination of channel size and spacing.

The choice of fuel for the first full-scale LMFR will depend upon the availability of U-238, which is much more attractive than U-235 because of better neutron economy, and a sufficient quantity for fueling an LMFR may be available in 10 to 15 years. In the early stages of this study, however, U-235 was arbitrarily chosen as the fuel for the parametric study. The selection of the reference design should be valid for either fuel.

In each case, the critical concentration and conversion ratio were determined by multigroup diffusion theory using 37 neutron energy groups. To handle the large number of calculations, a digital computer was used once the range of values for the parameters was established by a series of criticality calculations by hand.

The use of BeO as a moderator has the advantage of reducing the core size because of improved slowing-down power compared with graphite. Critical size, fuel concentration, and breeding ratio were determined for one case using BeO as a moderator.

Since the cost of bismuth as a primary coolant is between $3,000,000 and $4,000,000, the inventory charges are a significant fraction of the total fuel costs. One case was calculated using lead as a coolant in order to compare the increase in inventory charges due to the use of bismuth with the loss in conversion ratio due to the absorptions in the lead.

The resonance integral of the fertile material is a function of the scattering per atom, size of the fuel channel, and lattice spacing. The channel size and lattice spacing, however, are not specified; therefore, the lattice resonance parameters are not known. 3% in the conversion ratio.

Results of nuclear calculations: The results of the parametric study are summarized in Table 24-6 for all cases. The critical concentrations and conversion ratios for the cases using thorium as the fertile material are graphed in Figs. 24-21 through 24-25.

In all cases, the fuel concentration increases with an increase in fertile material (Woo, -24). An increase in V/V ratio increases the thorium content; reduces the slowing-down power; increases the average energy of the neutron spectrum in the core; and increases the thorium absorptions. As a result of these effects, the critical fuel concentration in the fluid fuel, N25/Nx ratio, increases as V/V ratio increases (-25).

The conversion ratio is highly dependent upon the N02/Nes ratio, the average energy of the neutron spectrum, and the reactor size. e. Likewise, the curves of conversion ratio versus V/V go through a maximum, with the maximum value occurring at increasingly higher values of V/V as Wo2 increases.

The worth of a pure graphite reflector was calculated for Case 11435. The reflector savings as a function of reflector thickness are shown in Figure 26.

The values of the conversion ratio and N25/Nxi ratio calculated in this parametric study are for hot, clean reactor conditions, and they are used for comparative purposes only. The effects of fission-product poisons, control rods, and Pa3 losses have not been included.

Reactor cost. Since the range of reactor sizes varies from 10 to 20 ft, reactor cost is an important variable. Reactor vessel, graphite, and erection costs have been estimated for several sizes. To these is added $167,000 for three control rods and miscellaneous hardware. Contingency and engineering of 44% were also assumed. A breakdown of these costs is listed.

Bismuth inventory charges. The bismuth inventory is determined by the primary system volume external to the reactor vessel, the volume of bismuth in the core, the volume of bismuth external to the core but inside the reactor vessel, and the holdup external to the reactor system.

No additional holdup is included to account for temperature expansion during startup, fuel feed system, and other sources of bismuth inventory. The assumption used throughout this study is that the volume of bismuth is equal to the volume of slurry, accounting for an additional 3 to 10% excess bismuth due to the ThO₂ content of the slurry.

To simplify the work in the absence of information concerning average values of fuel mass, the total mass of fuel was considered to be the hot, clean, critical loading at startup. The value of Mos is taken as the initial value, with M23 and Mj taken as zero.

Results of economic optimization: Since chemical processing costs are very sensitive to the chemical processing cycle time, and the optimum cycle time may vary with reactor design, the relative energy cost of each reactor design was determined, neglecting the chemical processing costs. The results of this study are tabulated in Table 24-9 and are shown graphically.

In many cases, the additional fuel inventory charges and reactor vessel costs corresponding to higher conversion ratios more than offset the reduction in fuel burnup costs. The economically optimum reactor is neither a burner nor a converter with the maximum conversion ratio, but somewhat between these extremes.

However, the increased fuel burnup and inventory charges associated with the lead coolant resulted in a net increase of $288,000 per year or 0. 14 mills/kWh in the fuel cost. BeO is not feasible as a moderator material for this concept because of its high cost. Fixed charges on the BeO alone add almost a mill/kWh to the fuel cost.

The six most attractive cases were selected, and the chemical processing costs were computed for several processing cycle times. The total costs tabulated in Table 24-10 are based on a 3000-day cycle time, and other costs are from Table 24-9. Since the aqueous processing costs are dependent upon the total thorium inventory to be processed, chemical processing costs penalize the designs with heavy thorium loadings. In Tables 24-9 and 24-10, the total costs are reduced to mills/kWh by using an electrical power output of 315 MW with an 80% plant factor.

Selection of a reference design. Using the data presented in Table 24-10, a design was selected for further study. It is important to realize that when chemical processing costs are included in the comparison of energy costs, there is little difference in the cheapest four or five cases. The relative attractiveness of these cases depends very heavily on the economic ground rules. With the wide range of freedom for the choice of nuclear parameters in this concept, the economic optimum can be chosen to correspond to any set of basic assumptions on economics. For example, an increase in fuel price would emphasize higher conversion ratios.

Time study. The nuclear performance of the reference design, Case 11344, was determined using a thorium lifetime program written for the digital computer. These calculations provided information concerning the variations of fission-product poisons, breeding ratio, and critical fuel mass as functions of reactor operating time. This information then made possible the choice of an optimum fuel processing cycle and the determination of overall fuel cost for the operating reactor.

Basis of time study. The reference design calculations used U-2 as fuel for both the initial charge and feed material. Since the contemplated construction date for an LMFR is 10 years in the future, the assumption that U-83 fuel will be available seems reasonable, and data based on U-33 allows comparison with previous work.

The reference design on which the time studies were based has a graphite side reflector 1. 5 ft thick, an active core diameter of 11 ft, and a core height of 14 ft. The average core temperature is 900°F. The nuclear constants used in the two-group criticality and isotope buildup calculations were determined by using a 40-group spectral code.

Poisoning (absorptions in Xe-135 to absorptions in fuel) was held at 0. 01 throughout life, and Sm-149 was allowed to reach a steady state. The other fission-product poisoning corresponds to poison data labeled "less Xe and Sm with high cross-sections except low Zr. " Due to a lack of information, no resonance absorption by the fission products was considered. The neutron flux averaged over the entire primary system volume was used in all isotope and poison buildup computation since this is a circulating fuel.

Results of time study: The study was carried out over 2000 days of full-power operation. The mass of U-83 fuel and the buildup of Pa-233 are shown in Figure 29, and the buildup of fission product poisons (other than Xe-135 and Sm) along with the breeding ratio are graphed in Figure 30. Other calculations have indicated that extrapolations for the expected life of the plant are reasonable.

The quantities necessary to evaluate the chemical processing costs for various processing cycles are average values of fuel mass and breeding ratio (M23, Miz, and BR). The average value of M3 is approximately the steady-state value. Miz and BR are shown in Figs. 24-29 and 24-30.

Selection of chemical processing cycle. These charges were computed using formulas similar to those described in Article 244. 4 but using data appropriate to U3 fuel.

The results of these calculations are tabulated in Table 24-11 and graphed in Figure 31. This analysis indicates an economic optimum processing cycle of approximately 4000 full-power days. However, only a small penalty of slightly more than $200/day (less than 0. 03 mills/kWh) is incurred by operating the reactor for its complete life (5840 full-power days) before sending the fuel to a chemical separations plant.

Specifications of the reference design: The single-region reactor design is illustrated in Figure 32. The core is constructed of large blocks of high-density material for the passage of fuel slurry. The graphite is supported by a number of compensated molybdenum rods and a bottom support plate. Provision is made for three or four liquid metal control rods if experience indicates they are necessary.

The reactor vessel is constructed of 21% Cr-1% Mo steel, 24 inches thick, designed for a temperature of 1150°F and a maximum pressure of 120 psi. Three 28-in. -diameter pipes carry the fluid into the reactor at the bottom and leave at the top. A drain line to the fuel dump tanks is also provided. The free space above the reactor core is used as the degasser to remove volatile fission products.

Economic considerations were essential to the optimization studies required to establish the reference designs presented in Sections 24-2 and 24-4. An important objective of this study is the economic comparison of energy costs for the single-fluid and the two-fluid externally cooled LMFR. A brief summary of energy costs for the optimum design in each concept is presented in Table 24-12.

The estimated costs of equipment, installation of equipment, and construction are based on the plant layouts for the two reference designs evaluated in this study. Construction and erection costs of all items, as well as direct materials costs for those components manufactured by the Babcock & Wilcox Company, were developed by B&W estimators.

24-5. 2 Maintenance and operation. In computing energy costs, the fixed charges on maintenance equipment and spare parts are included in the maintenance costs, while fixed charges on buildings used for maintenance are included in fixed charges on capital investment.

24-5. 3 Fuel costs. The fuel costs as presented in this report include (1) bismuth inventory, (2) fuel inventory, (3) fuel burnup, (4) thorium inventory, (5) thorium burnup, and (6) chemical processing. Sodium inventory is not included since it is used as a coolant fluid for the intermediate system and does not contain fuel.

In this chapter, three other types of Liquid Metal Fuel Reactors will be discussed. The first of these is the Liquid Metal Fuel Gas-Cooled Reactor. In principle, this reactor is similar to the LMFR previously discussed, but it has many features that are different. For example, it has a non-circulating fuel, and the heat is removed by cooling with helium under pressure. Advantages and disadvantages of this design over the circulating fuel LMFR will be discussed in the following pages.

The second reactor discussed in this chapter is the LAMPRE. This is a molten plutonium-fueled reactor which is under development at the Los Alamos Scientific Laboratory. Although only in its beginning stages of development, it is conceived as a high-temperature (650°C) fast breeder reactor utilizing plutonium as the fuel.

Introduction and objectives of concept. The Liquid Metal Fuel Gas-Cooled Reactor (LMF-GCR) design is unique in that it combines inert gas cooling with the advantageous liquid fuel approach. The LMF-GCR concept has a high degree of design flexibility. It is a high-temperature, high-efficiency system that may be designed as a thermal converter, uranium thermal breeder, or plutonium fast breeder that may produce heat, electric energy, or propulsive power, and that may power either a steam or a gas turbine.

The fundamental principle of the LMF-GCR is the utilization of an internally cooled fixed moderator-heat exchanger element with a fluid fuel center. The fuel is circulated slowly through the core to ensure proper mixing and to facilitate fuel addition. The core is cooled by gas that is pumped through it in passages that are separated by a suitable high-temperature material from the fuel channels. The many well-known advantages of fluid fuels are thereby gained without the penalties of circulating great quantities of corrosive, highly radioactive fuel-coolant solution and of tying up large amounts of expensive fuel outside the core.

Internal gas cooling avoids the corrosion and material problems encountered in reactor concepts that require the circulation of liquid fuels or coolants as a heat-transport medium. Helium has been selected as the gas coolant because it is inert and has better heat-transfer properties than other inert gases. Graphite has been chosen for the moderator and core element structural material in a thermal reactor because of its excellent moderating and high-temperature properties. Its resistance to corrosion by bismuth has been fairly well established, and the operating temperature is high enough so that energy storage in the graphite should not be a concern.

Reference design. A reference design of an LMF-GCR nuclear power station has been produced. A summary of the design parameters is given in Table 25-1. It is a graphite-moderated thermal reactor employing highly enriched uranium-bismuth fuel and helium coolant. The coolant leaves the core at 1300°F and is circulated through a superheater and steam generator, where it produces steam at 850 psig, 900°F.

In order that the capital cost of the first plant be low, the reference design is for a small plant producing approximately 16,000 kW net electrical output; however, it is large enough to demonstrate the practicability of an LMF-GCR and provide operational experience applicable to commercial-size plants. By assuming the feasibility of constructing a 13-ft diameter pressure vessel for a design pressure of 1000 psi, it appears possible to design a gas-cooled reactor plant having an electrical capacity of 240.

A U-235-fueled thermal reactor was chosen for the design because it will demonstrate the practicability of the LMF-GCR concept in a relatively simple reactor. A breeder is more complicated because it requires two similar systems for fuel and blanket solutions.

The reactor building and the general arrangement of components as conceived in the reference design are shown in Fig. 25-1. The reactor, primary coolant system, fuel system, and steam generator are enclosed in a gastight steel containment shell.

The reactor core, reflector, internal fuel and gas piping, and pressure vessel are shown in Fig. 2. The core, consisting of an array of graphite elements, has an active length of 56 in. and a cross-section approximating a circle of 56-inch diameter. Fig. 25-3 is a picture of a sample section of the core element. The larger rectangular holes are vertical fuel channels that would be 56 in. long in the reactor. The small crosswise slots are for helium coolant flow. This graphite element, which separates the two fluids, is similar to a heat exchanger that conducts heat from the fuel to the gas.

The channel surface, where it is removed by convection into the coolant stream.

By volume, the core region is approximately 65% graphite, 25% fuel, and 10% void space for coolant. The fuel solution contains fully enriched uranium dissolved in bismuth. With these proportions of fuel and moderator, the minimum critical dimensions as calculated for a cylindrical reactor are a height and diameter of approximately 42 in. For this application, a larger core size is required to have sufficient heat-transfer area. Since the graphite core elements are a permanent part of the reactor and are not changed in the routine refueling procedure, it is not required that they be interchangeable. A considerable amount of design flexibility is thereby achieved, and variations of the fuel channel, moderator, and gas channel geometry provide control over the nuclear and heat processes.

The buildup of fission products and uranium isotopes as a function of time was calculated to determine the fuel concentration necessary for criticality after various time periods of operation. Since the solubility of uranium in bismuth is limited to 6560 ppm at 965°F, the lowest fuel temperature in the LMF-GCR, the reactor fuel must be replaced or processed after the poisons build up to such a level that this solubility limit is exceeded by criticality requirements. With the total fuel inventory in the system utilization factor of 80%.

The systems required in the plant are shown by the flowsheet of -4. The heat is removed from the reactor by helium at 500 psia, which leaves the reactor at 1300°F and returns at 900°F. The steam is utilized by a standard turbine generator plant.

A steam-cycle generating plant was incorporated since it is highly developed. A closed-cycle gas turbine, the most probable alternative, has not yet been developed sufficiently for general utility application but may be advantageously combined with the LMF-GCR at some later time. In such a system, the reactor coolant would serve also as the cycle working fluid, eliminating the intermediate heat exchanger.

Although the reference LMF-GCR is envisioned as a high-enrichment reactor, it is possible, by changing the parameters, to use fuel of only 20% enrichment. This low-enrichment reactor would have the advantage of producing a sizeable fraction of its own fuel by creating Pu through neutron absorption in U38.

Parametric calculations of low-enrichment reactors have been made using a two-group, two-region spherical geometry computer code developed for the IBM 650 digital computer. The results show that to have a fuel lifetime long enough (about 1 year) to be of practical value, the dimensions of the reactor core should be equivalent to a sphere at least 6 feet in diameter.

Fuel flows upward through the reactor core and into the degasser; from there, the flow goes down into the sump tank and back into the reactor inlet. The fuel is pumped electromagnetically, and the flow is measured by an orifice or an electromagnetic flow meter.

The sump tank acts as a receiver for all the fuel in the loop when the core is to be drained. To keep the sump tank nearly empty during operation, the pressure differential between the helium cover gas in the sump tank and the degasser must be kept equal to the bismuth static head. The fuel is automatically drained into the sump tank when the pump is de-energized, and the two cover gas lines are connected together. Thus, there are no valves in the primary fuel loop that must be operated in order to drain the reactor.

Specific power, averaged over fuel lifetime, is approximately 3700 kW/kg. The power density, based on core volume in liters, is 25. 2 kW/liter. The average thermal flux, when clean, is 5. 9 x 10^4, and when averaged over the life of the fuel, it is approximately 3 x 10^14. The average fast flux when clean is around 6 x 10^4. The average moderator temperature is 800°C. 5 x 10^746 k/°C. The critical mass for clean enriched U is 5. 6 kg.

Fuel: Uranium makeup is added to the fuel solution on a day-to-day basis, thus keeping excess reactivity to a minimum. The operating lifetime of the fuel is nearly 5 years at full power and an 80% plant utilization factor. Fuel burnup may be as much as 80%, and the total U-235 inventory varies from about 7 kg at the beginning of fuel life to about 24 kg at the end of fuel life.

The LMF-GCR tends to be self-regulating. Under the influence of its negative temperature coefficient, the reactor will tend to operate at the same average moderator temperature at all power levels. This temperature will be maintained by controlling the uranium fuel solution concentration.

Spent fuel. After 4 to 5 years, nonvolatile fission-product poisons and nonfissionable isotopes of uranium accumulate to such an extent that a new fuel charge is required. The used fuel is drained into the spent fuel tank, and the reactor fuel loop is then ready to receive a new fuel charge. The spent fuel is transferred into a number of small, shielded shipping tanks for shipment to a chemical processing plant.

25-1. 4 Reactor materials. The critical problem associated with the LMF-GCR is the development of a core element. As a basic core element material, graphite is extremely attractive because it is a very good moderator, possesses excellent high-temperature strength, has unexcelled resistance to thermal shock, is not attacked by bismuth, has a low neutron absorption cross-section, possesses a satisfactorily high thermal conductivity, and shows evidence that radiation damage is rapidly annealed at high temperature. Presently available graphite is not impermeable to bismuth or gases, as the core element material of the LMF-GCR must be in order to separate the fuel and coolant satisfactorily. However, recent developments indicate a chance for success in this area.

The other aspect of core element development is to find a suitable means for joining the graphite to the upper and lower fuel system headers. The graphite-to-metal bond must have adequate mechanical strength and be resistant to corrosion, thermal cycling, and radiation damage. Bonds of this type have been prepared by means of high-temperature brazing techniques, and the work has shown that numerous additional bonding agents are available. Preliminary work is encouraging and indicates that with improvements in bond design, bond techniques, and test methods, solutions to the bonding problem may be achieved.

Alternate materials as the basic core element structural material are under investigation as a backup to the graphite development. These include KT silicon carbide, molybdenum, molybdenum carbide, niobium, niobium carbide, zirconium carbide, tantalum, and tantalum carbide, all of which have properties indicating promise for LMF-GCR application.

25-1. 5 Plant operation and maintenance. The LMF-GCR is primarily self-regulating, having a temperature coefficient of approximately -0. 5 x 10-4/°C. Large changes in power output are controlled by varying coolant flow rate while keeping the gas temperatures approximately constant. Coolant flow rate will be varied by controlling the helium blower speed and by changing the coolant gas density (pressure) with the compressor.

The main plant and reactor control room will be outside the reactor containment shell in the steam plant generator building. A full thickness of shielding wall separates the boiler and blower compartments from the reactor, and operating personnel will be able to conduct maintenance and inspection of these items while the reactor is in operation. This wall is penetrated by the concentric piping, which carries the primary gas into and out of the reactor. To attenuate radiation streaming through the pipe, a turn is made within the shield. During operation, the core and reflector are supported at the bottom of the pressure vessel.

Introduction: The long-range utility of nuclear power based on uranium fission depends on the development of a plutonium-fueled reactor capable of being refueled by an integral, or associated, breeding cycle. If full utilization of the energy content in the world's supply of uranium is to be accomplished, the more abundant U238 must be converted into the easily fissionable isotopes of plutonium. The need for this full utilization is apparent when it is realized that the economically recoverable U238 content of uranium ores is sufficient to supply projected world power requirements for only a few decades. Breeding on the plutonium cycle extends fission power capabilities by a factor of 140, yielding thousands, instead of tens, of years of world energy reserves.

The high values of the capture-to-fission ratio at thermal and epithermal neutron energies for the plutonium isotopes preclude these types of reactors from an integral plutonium breeding cycle system. To obtain an appreciable breeding gain, a plutonium-fueled reactor must be either a fast or a fast-intermediate neutron spectrum device where breeding ratios of the order of 1. 7 may be expected from suitably designed systems. One of the power-producing reactors of the future must logically be a fast plutonium.

In order to maintain a fast-neutron spectrum, fuel densities in a plutonium breeder will be high, and coolants must be either molten metals or salts. The latter characteristic will permit large amounts of power to be extracted from relatively small volumes, thus obtaining a large specific power. Hydrogenous and organic coolants are eliminated because of their attendant neutron moderation properties, high vapor pressures at high temperatures, and relatively poor resistance to radiation damage. For efficiency reasons, the system temperature should be as high as is compatible with a long operating life. Therefore, to be in step with modern electrical generation techniques, this would imply coolant outlet temperatures of the order of 650°C.

25-2. 2 Basic components. Before discussing the Los Alamos Molten Plutonium Reactor (LAMPRE) proposal in detail, the following resume will treat some of the possibilities for the three basic components of a power reactor: the fuel, the container, and the coolant.

Molten plutonium fuels. Plutonium metal melts at 640°C, a temperature that is somewhat high, but not beyond the bounds of utility. Fortunately, some alloys of plutonium have significantly lower melting temperatures. One characteristic of these transition metal alloys is that they do not dilute the fuel volumetrically to a great extent in their.

Other alloys of plutonium which are more dilute in fuel and have not too unreasonable melting temperatures are the magnesium-plutonium and bismuth-plutonium alloys.

Container materials. A material capable of being fabricated into various shapes and resistant to high-temperature corrosion by the fuel alloy is a necessity if practical use is to be made of the low melting temperature plutonium alloys. Since the transition metals readily form low melting point alloys with plutonium, the normal constructional materials, steels, and nickel alloys are eliminated.

The next alternatives, the refractory metals, have been used with measurable success to contain the various alloys of plutonium. Tungsten and tantalum have been somewhat better containers than molybdenum and niobium, and much better than chromium, vanadium, and titanium.

The limitations of metallurgical knowledge at present lead to the conclusion that tantalum will be one of the best container materials for these plutonium alloys. The high-temperature strength properties and the heat transfer properties of tantalum are excellent; moreover, it is weldable. The parasitic capture cross-section of tantalum would be intolerable in an epithermal or thermal power breeder reactor, and although relatively large in a fast spectrum, its effect on neutron economy in a fast reactor can be made small, if not minor, by careful design.

Dynamic corrosion tests indicate that tantalum's resistance to corrosion by molten sodium, a possible coolant, will be adequate. Long-term static corrosion tests (9000 hours at 650°C) indicate that the fuel is compatible with tantalum at proposed operating temperatures.

Coolant. The desire to obtain a high power density at high temperatures and low pressures in a high radiation field dictates the use of molten metal or salt coolant. The list of possibilities is topped by sodium and bismuth. A few words about the properties of these coolants are probably appropriate at this point.

Sodium is advantageous because of its low melting point, good heat transfer properties, low pumping power requirement, and because there has been considerable engineering experience with it. Its poor long-term corrosion properties when in contact with the better container materials such as tantalum, and its explosive burning property when exposed to water or moist air, are distinct disadvantages.

Bismuth, on the other hand, does not react explosively with water, nor does it burn in air. Pumping power requirements are some five times larger than for sodium. Its higher melting temperature and the polonium buildup problems are disadvantageous factors of a bismuth coolant.

The LAMPRE core consists of three parts: fuel alloy, container, and coolant. A proposed design, described in detail below, yields a structure which is approximately 50% by volume fuel alloy, 15% structure, and 35% coolant. The minimum tube separation is slightly under 1/16 in. At reasonable heat-transfer rates, this configuration is capable of developing a specific power of better than 250 watts/g. More efficient systems can utilize a similar structure but must dilute the fuel volumetrically to obtain a larger heat-transfer surface per unit of contained fuel. The larger area-to-volume ratio can be obtained by going to smaller diameter tubes and/or closer spacing of the tube array. In the tube-shell arrangement, the fuel is located on the outside of the tubes, and the coolant flows through the tubes. Such a scheme preserves the volumetric integrity of the fuel. Other radiator-type schemes which also preserve fuel integrity are.

Reflector. No attempt to breed will be carried out in the first LAMPRE concept. Although the overall coolant container will be made of stainless steel, the fast-neutron reflector will be made of steel and will be cooled by the main sodium stream. The thickness of the radial steel reflector will be adjusted to be thin enough, neutron-wise, to obtain adequate external reflector control, but will be too thick to allow the thermalized neutrons returning from the graphite shield to build up a power spike at the core surface. The core, although slightly coupled to the reflector and shield, will have a mean fission energy greater than 500 keV, ensuring a high possible breeding gain. The top and bottom stainless-steel reflector slugs will also be sodium-cooled and will be essentially “infinitely thick" to fast neutrons. The coolant channels will be drilled or machined into a solid slug or disk.

Control: The control of LAMPRE will be effected by reflector-type mechanisms. An annular shim control displacing the innermost 4 in. of shield with aluminum will be used as a coarse criticality adjustment mechanism. Several replacement cylinders, replacing the inner portions of aluminum with void, will be used as fine controls. A rotating control cylinder will be built into the system in anticipation of safety and neutron.

The radial thickness of the steel fast-neutron reflector is adjusted so that the fast and intermediate neutrons returning to the core from the aluminum reflector and graphite are worth approximately 10% to the core critical mass. Displacement of the aluminum reflector effectively reduces the neutron reflection back to the core, yielding an external, large-effect control mechanism adequately cooled by aluminum conduction and air convection.

There has been some work done at other locations on uranium oxide slurry reactors. At Knolls Atomic Power Laboratory, a uranium oxide-bismuth slurry reactor has been explored. In this reactor, the fuel, consisting of uranium oxide suspension and liquid bismuth, is pumped through a moderator matrix and then through an external heat exchanger. The reader will recognize that this is the same as the single-region LMFR described in the preceding chapter.

The studies at KAPL were encouraging. A small amount of experimental work indicated that dispersions of uranium oxide and bismuth can be made. These workers found that at 500 to 600°C, titanium is the best additive for promoting the wetting of UO2 by bismuth. An 8 w/o UO2-bismuth slurry was actually pumped with an electromagnetic pump at 450°C.

At Argonne National Laboratory, uranium oxide-NaK slurries have been studied as possible reactor fuels. This fuel would be suitable for a fast-breeder reactor. Investigations have been carried out at a maximum operated at temperatures ranging from 450 to 600°C. A slurry with 4.

The UO2 dropped out of suspension at temperatures above 500°C, but would resuspend at lower temperatures. When a very small amount of uranium metal was added to the slurry, better wetting of the particles was obtained, and no further settling above 500°C was observed.
