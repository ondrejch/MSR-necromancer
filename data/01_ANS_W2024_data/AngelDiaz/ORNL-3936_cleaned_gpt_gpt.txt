The power preparations included some system modifications shown to have been required by operating experience and by continuing development and analysis work. Remote maintenance techniques were tried and evaluated; some special tests were performed; the operators were trained and qualified for power operation, and the secondary containment was sealed and shown to have an acceptably low leak rate.

The nuclear performance of the system at 211 powers up to 1 MW was highly satisfactory. Reproducible reactivity behavior and a lack of significant cross-contamination between the fuel and flush salts were demonstrated. Dynamics tests at power showed that the reactor has a slightly wider margin of stability than had been predicted from calculations. Preliminary results indicate that xenon poisoning may be lower than was anticipated.

The performance of most of the equipment was satisfactory, but substantial operational difficulty was caused by plugging of very small openings in off-gas system components by organic material. This problem was extensively investigated after the shutdown from 1 MW. Other, less serious problems included the freak failure of an electric motor inside the secondary containment, activation of the corrosion inhibitor in the treated cooling water, air entrainment in the cooling water, and excessive radiation levels in a few remote areas. Solutions have been developed for all the problems except the off-gas plugging, which is still under study.

Formal design of the instrumentation and control systems for the MSRE was completed. Additions and modifications are now being made as needed to provide additional protection, improve performance, or provide more information for the operators.

The addition of a low-level BF3 counting channel with control functions, the addition of cadmium shielding in the neutron instrument penetration, and changing reactor period interlock trip points were required to obtain satisfactory performance of the nuclear instrumentation system. The remaining changes were mostly of secondary importance, some sporadic.

The data logger-computer was put into operation in conjunction with the reactor. Although the performance has not been up to expectations, it is proving useful to the operation of the reactor experiment. A power level simulator was assembled, and it operated satisfactorily for the training of operators.

The fast thaw requirement was eliminated in all freeze valves except for those which control the emergency drain of the reactor and of the coolant system. The operation of all the valves, which might contain sufficient radioactivity in the salt to produce radiolytic fluorine at low temperature, is now operated above 400°F, which is above the threshold for fluorine release.

The braided wire sheath cover for the convoluted hose of Control Rod No. 3 was found to be severely torn about 2 ft below its upper end. The cause was traced to a jammed roller in the upper bend of the control rod thimble. The roller was replaced, and the upper rod sheath was repaired. There has been no further difficulty after several months of operation.

Control rod drive unit No.3 was replaced because of a shift in the remote position indication and because of a tendency for the lower limit switch to stick. The shift of the indicated position was eliminated by removing the excess slack in the chain, which had allowed the chain to slip over the sprocket.

Modifications were made to the radiator door guide tracks and lock mechanisms to allow for thermal distortion found after the initial operation of the radiator doors at temperature.

A loss-of-tension device was designed which will stop the radiator door drive unit should the door support cables show any slack as the door is being lowered. This arrangement is intended to prevent damage to the support cable if the radiator door jams, as well as to indicate a malfunction.

Failure of the insulation on the electrical leads to the radiator heaters was traced to excessive heat leakage into the area immediately above the radiator. Changes were made to reduce the temperature in this area, and electrical insulation with a higher temperature rating was installed.

Several changes were made to the sampler-enricher to improve the operation and safety of this system. Among these were the changes made to the interlock circuit, which require that additional barriers be present during certain critical operations, thereby ensuring double containment at all times.

During the same period, ten samples were removed from the coolant system, two of which were the larger 50 g samples. The first sample taken after an extended shutdown had a black film on it, which was identified as decomposed oil. Although there was oil in the general area, the exact source was not established. No films were found on subsequent.

A system is being designed to permit analysis of the reactor off-gas stream. It will contain: a thermal conductivity cell for online indication of the gross contaminant level; a chromatograph for quantitative determination of contaminants; a refrigerated molecular sieve trap for isolation of a concentrated sample for transfer to a hot laboratory for isotopic analysis.

Estimates of the 3xe poison fraction for the MSRE were computed as a function of several parameters. At 10 MW, the results indicate that the poison fraction is 1.6%. It was found that the mass transfer coefficient from the salt to the graphite is controlling the transfer and that the properties of the graphite are not important.

The MSRE pump test facility was modified, and the prototype pump was operated for periods of 165 and 166 hours at 1200°F to provide shakedown of the spare fuel pump impeller and the spare coolant pump drive motor. The spare rotary element for the fuel pump was modified to provide positive sealing against oil leakage from the shaft lower seal, catch basin into the system past the outside of the shield plug. The drive motor containment vessel was redesigned, and the new design will be used for the fifth drive motor vessel. Modified ejectors were installed on the lubrication systems for the MSRE salt pumps, and the lubrication pump endurance test was continued. The MK-2 fuel pump tank design was completed and is being reviewed.

Performance of the ball-float-type transmitter installed at the MSRE continues to be satisfactory. Some difficulties were experienced with a similar (prototype) transmitter on the MSRE pump test loop; however, these troubles were anticipated and corrected in the design of the.

For the purpose of online computation of control rod reactivity with the TRW-340 data logger, a mathematical formula was fitted to the rod-worth vs. position curves obtained from calibration experiments. The form of the expression used was obtained by applying a perturbation technique to evaluate the integral expression for the rod reactivity. A linear least-squares curve-fitting procedure was then used to evaluate the unknown coefficients in the resulting functional expression.

Theoretical calculations were made to estimate the influence of the overall spatial distribution of ^135Xe absorbed in pores near the graphite surfaces in the reactor core. The purpose was to determine spatial correction factors for use in the online calculation of ^135Xe reactivity with the TRW-340. Based on an approximate model of the reactor core, these calculations indicated that the equilibrium ^135Xe reactivity at 10 MW is reduced by a factor of about 0.76 relative to the value obtained from a point calculation. In addition, this correction was found to depend on the time history of the power level. Results of calculations are presented for step changes in power level, increasing to and decreasing from 10 MW.

The reactor control specimen rig, which will establish baseline data by exposing graphite and Hastelloy N surveillance specimens to approximately the operating conditions of the MSRE, except for radiation, has been loaded with salt and is being calibrated with the computer that monitors the MSRE.

Metallographic examination of capsules from in-pile experiment MIR47-6 showed no evidence of nitriding of the Hastelloy N. No apparent change in wall thickness or evidence of attack was observed, although an unexplained change in the etching characteristics of the grain boundaries at the surface was noted.

A small pipe of grade CGB graphite, brazed to molybdenum, satisfactorily contained molten fluoride salts at 700°C under pressures of 50, 100, and the first of a series of tests of graphite-to-metal joints to determine if such joints are corrosion-resistant and mechanically adequate for the requirements of molten-salt breeder reactors.

The radiation damage problems were evaluated for graphite in advanced molten-salt reactors, considering growth rate, creep coefficient, flux gradient, and geometric restraint as important factors. The stress developed by differential growth in an isotropic graphite should not be allowed to exceed the fracture strength of the graphite and thus cause failures. The estimated life of graphite is at least five years before failure from inability to absorb creep deformation. The major uncertainty seems to be the ability of graphite to sustain doses of 2 x 10^77 nyt without loss of integrity.

Creep-rupture life of Hastelloy N was found to be less affected by irradiation as the stress levels are lowered. The effects of irradiation temperature on the post-irradiation creep life of air-melted heats are uncertain. Pretest heat treatment can improve the ductility of irradiated specimens. The creep-rupture properties of structural material in the MSRE appear to be better than originally predicted on the basis of linear extrapolation of data for stress vs. log of rupture time.

Three innovations have been introduced in the chemical analysis of MSRE salts: a new endpoint for uranium titrations, a new method for determining structural-metal ions, and a new method for oxide analyses. Together, they have given increased assurance that the fuel conforms to the inventory composition and that the chemical purity of the salt has been maintained.

In a study of the physical chemistry of fluoride melts, vapor-pressure measurements have been made for three compositions in the LiF-BeF2 system. Because of vapor-phase association, the apparent volatility of LiF increases with decreasing concentration of LiF in the melt. Methods have been developed for predicting density, specific heat, and thermal conductivity in molten fluorides.

The solubility of oxide in MSRE-related fluoride melts has been reevaluated with improved experiments. When increasing amounts of ZrF2, as present in the MSRE fuel, are added to flush salts, the capacity for oxide first decreases, then increases.

Interest in reprocessing methods for MSBR fluorides has led to continuing studies of distillation and of chemical reduction as a means of separating rare earths from fuels or protactinium from blankets. The composition that yields MSRE barren solvent as distillate has been found; this product distills, leaving the rare earths behind. Alloys of bismuth containing a small amount of lithium have proved very effective for reducing and extracting rare earths into a liquid-metal phase. Thorium has been found effective as a reducing agent for removing protactinium from blanket melts. Protactinium can also be removed on ZrO2.

The precision and accuracy of the hydrofluorination method for determining oxide in MSRE salts were established. The method was applied to the analysis of nonradioactive samples taken during the startup of the MSR. The results were in reasonable agreement with those obtained by the KBrF method.

Tin, iron, and nickel were determined voltammetrically in a sample of molten fuel withdrawn from the MSR. These measurements indicate that the major fraction of iron and nickel in the fuel is present in an un-ionized state, presumably as finely divided metal. Additionally, a well-defined voltammetric wave for the reduction U(IV) to U(III) was observed.

The MSBR reference design concept is a two-region, two-fluid system with fuel salt separated from the blanket salt by graphite tubes. The energy produced in the reactor fluid is transferred to a secondary coolant-salt circuit, which couples the reactor to a supercritical steam cycle. Onsite fluoride volatility processing is employed, which leads to low unit processing costs and economic reactor operation as a thermal breeder. The resulting power cost is estimated to be 2.7 mills/kWh for investor-owned utilities. The associated fuel cycle cost is 0.45 mill/kWh (electrical). The specific fissile inventory is 0.8 kg/MW (electrical), and the fuel doubling time is 21 years. Development of a protactinium removal scheme for the blanket region of the MSBR could lead to power costs of 2.6 mills/kWh (electrical), a fuel cycle cost of 0.

A close-coupled facility for processing the fuel and fertile streams will be an integral part of a molten-salt breeder reactor system. The fuel salt will be processed on a 40-day cycle. The uranium will be removed from the carrier salt and fission products by fluorination, and the carrier salt will be recovered from the fission products by a semi-continuous vacuum distillation. Relative volatilities between lithium and reconstitution of the fuel salt, by combining the purified carrier salt with the purified UF6, can be done by direct absorption of the UF6 in the fuel salt, which already contains some UF6, and subsequent reduction of the intermediate uranium fluoride to UF6 with hydrogen. Experimental tests showed rapid and complete absorption. The primary problems in continuous fluorination of the fuel salt to remove the uranium are corrosion.

And getting adequate mass transfer and countercurrent flow to ensure good recovery. Corrosion can probably be eliminated by the use of a layer of frozen salt on the wall of the vessel. Experimental work with a small countercurrent continuous fluorinator gave recoveries of 90 to 96% of the uranium. Fluorination during the processing of the fuel from the MSRE produces volatile chromium fluorides. These can be effectively trapped, with negligible uranium losses, by the use of sodium fluoride beds. A preliminary design study has been made on a conceptual processing plant incorporating the above concepts. Among the problems which this study illuminated were the complications from the handling of high-heat generating materials. The fixed capital cost for the conceptual plant was $5. 3 million, the salt inventory cost was $0. 196 million, and the direct operating cost was $787,790. 00 per year.

The Molten-Salt Reactor Program is concerned with research and development for nuclear reactors that use mobile fuels, which are solutions of fissile and fertile materials in suitable carrier salts. The program is an outgrowth of the ANP efforts to make a molten-salt reactor power plant for aircraft and is extending the technology originated there to the development of reactors for producing low-cost power for civilians.

The major goal of the program is to develop a thermal breeder reactor. Fuel for this type of reactor would be 33U, or 35UF, dissolved in advanced converter reactors or in burners of fissionable uranium and plutonium that also use fluoride fuels. Solutions of uranium, plutonium, and thorium salts in chloride and fluoride carrier salts offer attractive possibilities for mobile fuels for intermediate and fast breeder reactors. The fast reactors are of interest too but are not a significant part of.

Our major effort is being applied to the development, construction, and operation of a Molten-Salt Reactor Experiment. The purpose of this experiment is to test the types of fuels and materials that would be used in the thermal breeder and the converter reactors and to obtain several years of experience with the operation and maintenance of a small molten-salt power reactor. A successful experiment will demonstrate, on a small scale, the attractive features and the technical feasibility of these systems for large civilian power reactors. The MSRE operates at 1200°F and at atmospheric pressure and will generate 10 MW of heat. Initially, the fuel contains 0. 9 mole % UF4, 5 mole % ZrF4, 29.1 mole % BeF2, and 65 mole % LiF, and the uranium is about 30% 238U. The melting point is 840°F. In later operation, we expect to use highly enriched uranium in the lower concentration typical of the fuel for the core of a breeder.

The fuel circulates through a reactor vessel and an external pump and heat exchange system. All this equipment is constructed of Hastelloy N, a new nickel-molybdenum-chromium alloy with exceptional resistance to corrosion by molten fluorides and with high strength at high temperatures. The reactor core contains an assembly of graphite moderator bars that are in direct contact with the fuel. The graphite is a new material of high density and small pore size. The fuel salt does not wet the graphite and therefore should not enter the pores, even at pressures well above the operating pressure.

Heat produced in the reactor is transferred to a coolant salt in the heat exchanger, and the coolant salt is pumped through a radiator to dissipate the heat to the atmosphere. A small facility is installed in the MSRE building for occasionally processing the fuel by treatment with gaseous HF and Fo.

Design of the MSRE was begun early in the summer of 1960. Orders for special materials were placed in the spring of 1961. Major modifications to Building 7503 at ORNL, in which the reactor is installed, were started in the fall of 1961 and were completed by January 1963.

Fabrication of the reactor equipment was begun early in 1962. Some difficulties were experienced in obtaining materials and in making and installing the equipment, but the essential installations were completed so that prenuclear testing could begin in August of 1964. The prenuclear testing was completed with only minor difficulties in March of 1965. Some modifications were made before beginning the critical experiments in May, and the reactor was first critical on June 1, 1965. The zero-power experiments were completed early in July. Additional modifications, maintenance, sealing, and testing of the containment were required before the reactor began to operate at appreciable power. The reactor had been operated for a short time at 1 MW at the time of this report. Further increases in power were delayed by difficulties with the off-gas system.

Because the MSR is of a new and advanced type, substantial research and development effort is provided in support of the design and construction. Included are engineering development and testing of reactor components and systems, metallurgical development of materials, and studies of the chemistry of the salts and their compatibility with graphite and metals both in-pile and out-of-pile. Some studies are being made of the large power breeder reactors for which this technology is being developed.

This report is one of a series of periodic reports in which we describe briefly the progress of the program. ORNL-3708 is an especially useful report because it gives a thorough review of the design and construction and supporting development work for the MSRH. It also describes much of the general technology for molten-salt reactor systems.

Preparations for operation at high power were completed, and the experimental program was resumed. The power ascension was interrupted at 1 MV; however, by partial or complete plugging at several points in the fuel off-gas system. The plugging materials were identified as organics, probably the products of oil decomposition.

Two of the larger modification jobs scheduled before power operation, the coolant line anchor sleeves and the installation of new radiator doors, were completed in August. Late that month, the assembly of graphite and Hastelloy N surveillance specimens, which had been in the core from the beginning of salt operation, was removed. While the reactor vessel was open, inspection revealed that pieces were broken from the horizontal graphite bar supporting the sample array. The pieces were recovered for examination, and a new sample assembly, designed for exposure at high power and suspended from above, was installed.

Tests had shown that heats of Hastelloy N used in the reactor vessel had poor high-temperature rupture life and ductility in the as-welded condition. The vessel closure weld had not been heat-treated, so it was heated to 1400°F for 100 hours using the installed heaters to improve these.

The closure devices on containment penetrations had been tested. Now testing of the containment provided by the reactor cell, drain cell, and vapor-condensing system became the primary effort. After preliminary tests at pressures up to 5 psig, the program was interrupted on October 21 to install Masonite sheets between the cell membranes and upper blocks to modify the access opening over the core. Testing at 20 psig disclosed many small leaks at penetrations, which were repaired (many while the reactor cell was open for ten days for strain-gage measurements of piping stresses). After the repairs, leakage rates were measured at 10.

20 and 30 psig. Extrapolation to 39 psig (the peak pressure in the maximum credible accident) gave a leak rate of 0. 4% per day, compared to 1. 0% per day assumed in the safety analysis. Leakage rates at ~2 psig (the normal operating pressure) were measured to serve as a reference during subsequent operation. This program was completed on December 5.

Stresses in the reactor cell piping and vessels were calculated in detail to permit evaluation of the service life of the Hastelloy N parts under irradiation. Some adjustments of supports were made to minimize stresses; after which, the calculated stresses were acceptably low except at the heat exchanger nozzles, where a complicated geometry made calculations unreliable. The strain-gage measurements in early November showed tolerable stresses at this point also.

While the containment testing and strain-gauge measurements were underway, the operators and supervisors underwent further training with emphasis on power operation. Classroom lectures were followed by practice on a simulator, which included the actual controls, instrumentation, control rods, and radiator doors. Examinations and certification of qualified operators followed.

Early tests with the radiator hot and the exercises during simulator practice showed that the operation of the radiator doors was unreliable. Four weeks in November and December were spent modifying and adjusting the door rollers, tracks, seals, and limit devices before tests showed they would operate reliably, hot or cold.

Air leakage from the radiator enclosure when the main blowers were operated proved to be excessive, both from the standpoint of coolant cell ventilation capacity and because of excessive heating outside of the enclosure. Hoods were installed into which the radiator doors retracted, and the sheet-metal enclosure was generally tightened and modified before leakage became acceptable. Even after the improvements, it was necessary to supplement the cell exhaust with ducting to one annulus plower to attain a negative pressure in the coolant cell.

When the main radiator blowers were operated with the radiator hot, air leaking from the top of the enclosure overheated electrical insulation in that area. It was necessary to install ceramic insulation on leads on top of the radiator and reroute the leads to cooler locations.

As soon as containment testing was finished, the instruments, controls, and equipment were given the checkouts required prior to startup. The fuel system was then heated, and flush salt was circulated for three days. Samples of the flush salt taken at this time were analyzed for oxides by an improved, more reliable method. Results averaged less than 100 ppm, well below tolerable levels. Evidently, the measures taken to avoid oxygen contamination while the reactor vessel and fuel pump were open were effective.

Fuel salt was charged into the loop, and the reactor was taken critical on December 20. Between then and January 18, when the coolant loop was filled, nuclear experiments were restricted to powers below 25 kW. Even so, useful measurements were made on flux distributions in the thermal shield and beside the reactor vessel, control rod shadowing effects, and zero-power kinetics of the nuclear system. At the same time, numerous fuel-salt samples were analyzed, showing uranium in excellent agreement with expectations, low oxide concentration, and practicality.

With the coolant system in operation, the power was raised to 100, 500, and then 1000 kW as heat was extracted at the radiator. Dynamics tests and heat balances were conducted at each power. On January 23, while the power was at 500 kW, the fuel pressure control valve (or its filter) showed signs of plugging, but the situation cleared up in a few hours. There was also evidence of an abnormal restriction in the equalizing line between the fuel pump and the drain tanks. The next day, the reactor was taken to 1 MV, and a few hours later signs of intermittent plugging in the fuel off-gas line again appeared. (The systems were kept hot, with helium circulating. ).

The check valve in the vent line to the auxiliary charcoal bed was removed, and the line was reconnected. Gas then freely passed through the lines. The fuel drain cell was opened, and the flow-restricting capillary in the equalizing line was removed. This line then proved to contain small amounts of intensely radioactive material; they were not plugged.

Meanwhile, the plugging of the fuel pressure control valve (or filter) recurred. Blowing backward through the line did not clear the obstruction, so the assembly of valve and filter was removed. A new valve was installed, and the assembly was replaced to see if it were open. (This was simpler than flow testing the contaminated parts outside the system. ) At first, the pressure drop was acceptable, but over a few hours, excessive pressure drop again developed. After the assembly was removed, the new valve was proved to be clear, so the filter was taken to the HRLEL for examination.

Three below its original value. There was some solid material in the pores of the filter, but the pressure drop across the filter was not as high as it had apparently been while installed. Inspection showed that the valve trim was coated with oil and varnish-like material.

Also, while the reactor was down, pressure drops across the charcoal beds were measured. There had been intermittent indications of excessive pressure drops during the 1-MW operation and just afterward, but when measured before the next startup, they were normal. Operators and extension handles on the charcoal-bed hand valves had been repaired during this interval. (IEE, rust, and binding had prevented easy operation, and screws in two of the extensions had sheared. ).

Operation was resumed, and fuel was circulated for 44 hours before the power was raised to 1 MW. It was necessary to gradually open the hand valve being used for pressure control about 1/4 turn during this period in order to hold the fuel pressure in the range of 4 to 6 psig. The implication was that a small amount (perhaps 0. 01 in. ) of material had built up on the valve trim. Within 3 hours after going to 1 MW, the apparent accumulation of material accelerated. The valve was adjusted to maintain control, but a short time after making an unusually large adjustment, the differential pressure across the charcoal bed and valves suddenly increased, indicating blockage in those lines.

The reactivity balance involves calculation of the effects of changes in all known variables affecting reactivity. The net effect of changes between any two times that the reactor is critical should be zero if the calculations are accurate. Deviations from zero indicate either errors in the measurements and calculations or some unforeseen effect.

The reference conditions for the reactivity balance were established in run 3 (the zero-power experiments which ended July 4, 1965). Between then and the startup in December, one variable changed significantly — the 235U concentration in the fuel. Thus, the drain and mixing at the end of run 3 caused a substantial decrease in 235U concentration, but one that could be calculated.

The resultant reactivity was converted to a predicted control-rod configuration for criticality at 1200°F and zero power, using the control rod poisoning representation based on the rod calibrations. The predicted critical position of the regulating rod (rod dk/k) may be due to several factors, including (1) differences in temperature measurement, (2) inventory errors at the end of run 3, and (3) errors in the rod-poisoning calculation. The most important conclusion to be drawn from this is that there was no significant dilution of the fuel salt by the flush-salt operation.

Critical operation of the reactor during runs 4 and 5 provided an opportunity for checking out some parts of the reactivity-balance calculation. The computer-executed reactivity balance was not used because: (1) the accurate representation of control-rod poisoning had not been incorporated into the program; (2) the calculation of xenon poisoning was not fully developed; and (3) there were indications of other systematic errors in the program that had not been resolved. However, several manual calculations were made at very low powers where the fission product poisoning and fuel burnup terms are insignificant. Some calculations were also made at powers up to 1 MW but without the xenon and samarium terms.

Calculations after up to 24 hours of operation at 1 MW showed no measurable change from the zero-power reactivity balances. Neglect of the fission product terms should have resulted in a change of about -0. 2% Δk/k if the anticipated xenon behavior had occurred. This is much larger than the scatter in the measurements, so one can conclude that the xenon poisoning was actually much less than predicted.

The difference between the indicated and actual position of control rod 3, which developed after the start of run 4, was reflected as a shift of about 0. 05% Sk/k in the zero-power reactivity balance. This demonstrated the ability of the reactivity balance to show up small changes, at least under simple conditions; that is, no fission product poisoning and low power.

One objective of the early power tests was to correlate the thermal power of the reactor and the outputs of the various neutron sensing elements. Various methods were used in the approach to 1 MW with reasonably good agreement.

The first approximation used throughout Run 3 was based on calculations of the inherent (alpha-n) source in the fuel and subcritical multiplication. The primary purpose of this calibration was to permit positioning of the safety chambers so that they would provide a control rod scram at a few kilowatts and still not interfere with the planned experiments at lower powers. Absolute accuracy was not required since none of the experiments involved operation at powers where thermal effects were apparent.

A thermal power calibration was made shortly after the start of run 4 at a nominal 25 kW. At this time, only the fuel loop was full and circulating. The thermal power was evaluated from the rate of temperature rise and the known heat capacity of the loop. This provided a basis for subsequent operation at higher powers and, incidentally, showed that the initial source power calibration had been in error by only 8%. However, the second test was divided into two parts. First, the nuclear power was set at about 75 kW, and 75 kW of electrical heat input to the loop was turned off. These operations did not lead to a steady temperature, but the change in temperature slope with time before and after the increase to 75 kW was used to correct the thermal power.

Flux measurements were also made in the reactor furnace (4 in. from the reactor vessel wall) in the location later occupied by metallurgical surveillance specimens. The measurements were made using gold and copper foils. The foils were sealed in a stainless steel envelope from which air had been purged to protect the copper from oxidation during the irradiation at 1200°F. Fluxes were measured along a vertical line 80 in. long. The peak flux (at approximately the core midplane), extrapolated to 3 power of 10 MV, was 7 x 10^7 neutrons cm/sec. Fast and thermal contributions to this flux were 4.

A number of dynamic tests were performed during operation at zero power and subsequently at power levels up to 1 MW. The purpose of these tests was to investigate the inherent stability of the system, as well as to evaluate the mathematical models and the parameters that were used to predict its dynamic characteristics.

The inherent stability of the system (i. e. , without automatic control) was the subject of an exhaustive theoretical analysis in which it was concluded that the reactor would be stable at all powers and that its stability characteristics would improve as the power level increased. Tests made on the reactor operating without servo control at power levels of 75 kW, 465 kW, and 1 MW confirmed these predictions, as shown in Fig. 1. 2, which shows the response of the power to arbitrary perturbations. The improvement in the natural damping characteristics and the decrease in the period of oscillation with increasing power level are clearly shown. Figure 1. 3 shows a comparison of the experimental and theoretical periods of oscillation.

A subject of considerable interest during the MSRE development was whether or not the reactor power would wallow when operating without servo control. Wallowing would occur if the system were unstable or if random perturbations in reactivity or cooling load induced lightly damped.

Power oscillations were observed at both 75 and 465 kW, but the power level perturbations were less than +5%. In both cases, neither of the main radiator blowers was on, so the bulk of the cooling load was due to natural convection and radiation, and random fluctuations in load were seen.

In this case, however, the bulk of the cooling was by forced convection, and the power level fluctuations were reduced considerably.

Both pseudorandom binary tests and pulse tests were carried out in order to determine the frequency response of the system.

Pseudorandom binary tests were run at power levels of 100 W, 75 kW, 465 kW, and 1 MW. The particular sequences and their duration were selected so that the expected low-frequency resonance in the frequency response amplitude could be identified. Sequences with 19, 63, 127, and 511 bits per sequence were used. As will be shown below, this type of test worked quite satisfactorily.

Single reactivity pulse tests were also run but the resulting transients were inadequate for frequency response analysis. Since the signal strength of a single pulse is distributed continuously over a wide frequency range, pulse tests require a comparatively low-noise signal.

The low-frequency load perturbations seen at low power reduced the signal-to-noise ratio to an unacceptable value in the frequency range of interest (0. 002 to 1 radian/sec). Pulse and step response tests are planned at higher power levels where the conditions should be more favorable.

The pseudorandom binary reactivity input required a very precisely controlled series of regulating rod insertions and withdrawals. Since the frequency range of interest was from about 0. 002 to 1. 0 radian/sec, the rod jogger was designed so that sequences with a bit time of 3 to 5. A computer was used to control the bit time and the rod drive motor "on times for the insert and withdraw commands. The MSRE digital computer was programmed to control the sequencing of the pulse train by means of a shift-register algorithm. The number of bits in the sequence could be varied over a range between 3 and 33,554,431 bits.

The test data were analyzed using two independent digital computer methods. This duplication was done as a check on the analysis procedures. The direct method used a digital filtering technique to obtain the spectral density of the input and the cross-spectral density of the input and the output. It is necessary that frequencies selected for analysis be harmonic frequencies since the input signal is periodic. These were then used to give the frequency response as in the direct-method analysis. Both methods gave essentially the same results.

The results of the MSRE frequency response tests for power levels show deviations from theoretical predictions. The experimental results consistently indicate a lower magnitude ratio for (85N/No)/(8k/ko) than the theoretical predictions across all frequencies and power levels. However, the shapes of the experimental curves align closely with the predictions. Ongoing efforts are focused on identifying the underlying reasons for these discrepancies. Fortunately, the theoretical work referenced in ref. 3 includes calculations of the sensitivity of the frequency response to changes in various system parameters. This information is proving valuable in determining which system parameters may be responsible for the observed discrepancies.

Early work suggests that the zero-power discrepancies are due to the effect of fuel-salt plenums above and below the core. These regions increase the effective volume of the core. An increase of the effective core volume to include one-third of the upper and lower plenums in the theoretical model gives agreement with experimental results.

The at-power theoretical results obtained with the increased effective core volume agree with experimental results at higher frequencies for the at-power runs, but the discrepancies in magnitude ratio remain at low frequencies around the peak. The computed sensitivities indicate that the frequency response in this range is most sensitive to power.

In order to get a more accurate estimate of the fuel temperature coefficient of reactivity, the hot-slug transient test as reported earlier was modified and rerun in January 1966. In this test, the reactor power level was controlled by the flux servo at 100 W with the fuel loop circulating, and the coolant loop stagnant. After heating the stagnant coolant salt about 20°F hotter than the fuel salt, the coolant pump was started, producing a hot slug of fuel in the heat exchanger, which was subsequently introduced into the core. In this test, then, the change in reactivity was due entirely to the change in temperature, and the rod-induced reactivity required to keep the reactor critical was approximately equal and opposite to that due to the fuel and graphite temperature change. Further corrections have yet.

The transfer function of the reactor outlet temperature response to changes in reactor inlet temperature was also calculated from this test, and the plot of magnitude ratio vs frequency is shown in Fig. 14. Note that the experimental curve indicates much greater attenuation over most of the frequency range shown. 1 radian/sec. Reasons for this discrepancy are being studied.

Some difficulty with plugging and partial restrictions in the MSRE off-gas systems has been encountered at various times in the operation of the reactor systems. In the past, these obstructions have developed at in-line filters and pressure-control valves with extremely small flow passages. During early operations, the plugging of filters was attributed to having filters with inadequate flow areas to accommodate the material to be removed from the gas streams. For example, the original filter in the coolant off-gas line, 528, was a tubular element only 1 inch long by 1/2 inch in diameter. The plugging of valves appeared to be a result of filters which were too coarse to remove all the particles that were capable of causing plugs.

Fuel and coolant off-gas lines. The fuel-system pressure-control valve (RCV 522), which had exhibited some erratic behavior in run 3, was tested and found to have the same pressure-drop characteristics that it had when first installed. This valve was reinstalled for the next operation of the reactor. No further difficulties were encountered with the coolant off-gas system, but several problems developed in the fuel system. (See Fig. 15 for a simplified flowsheet of the fuel off-gas system. ).

The performance of the fuel off-gas system was satisfactory during the subcritical and low-power (up to 25 kW) operation of the reactor in December 1965 and January 1966. The first indication of difficulty in this run (run 4) occurred on January 23 with the reactor power at 500 kW. The total integrated power accumulated up to this time was about 3 MWh. At that time, the system pressure began to rise slowly, indicating either a restriction in the vicinity of PCV 522 or a malfunction of the valve.

Of this pressure transient, the response of the drain-tank pressures indicated an abnormal restriction at a capillary flow restrictor in line 521; the fuel-loop-to-drain-tank pressure equalizing line. The excess pressure in the fuel system was relieved by venting gas through HCV 533.

To the auxiliary charcoal bed until the restriction at PCV 522 was cleared by operating the valve several times through its full stroke. The reactor was made subcritical after 4-1/2 hr operation at 500 kW.

Satisfactory pressure control was maintained for about 24 hours, but the plugging at HCV 522 recurred shortly after the reactor power was raised to 1 MV. Again, the operation of this valve through its full stroke was effective in relieving at least part of the restriction. However, on this occasion, evidence of restrictions at the charcoal-bed inlets began to appear. These restrictions were bypassed by putting the two spare charcoal-bed sections (24 and 28) in service and closing the inlet valves to the two that were restricted (1A and 1B). Within about 6 hours, the inlets of beds 2A and 2B also plugged. When the previously plugged beds were checked, at least one was found to be clear, and off-gas flow was reestablished through bed 1B. These were caused by misalignment of extension handles and corrosion due to weather exposure and resulted in two of the valves becoming inoperative.

The combination of difficulties in the off-gas system resulted in a reactor shutdown to correct the conditions. The restrictions in the equalizing line (521) and the auxiliary vent line (533) were relieved by removing the capillary (FE 521) and a check valve (CV 533) respectively. The valve and filter assembly, and a second valve that had been tried briefly, were removed from line 522. The original valve and the filter were subsequently subjected to detailed examinations which are described in Component Development, this report. Pressure-drop measurements showed a higher pressure drop by a factor of 3 to 4 in the valve and a factor of 10 in the filter. However, the observed restrictions, particularly in the case of the filter, were not high enough to account for the observed pressure behavior in the operating system.

While the reactor was shut down, several measurements were made of the pressure drop across individual sections of the charcoal beds. Measurements made shortly after the shutdown showed essentially normal pressure drops for three of the four sections. Mechanical repairs had been made to the operating mechanisms of the valves, but these did not affect the flow characteristics.

The preparations for the next startup included the installation of a large, relatively coarse (50-4) filter and a large, open hand valve at the PCV 522 location. This arrangement eliminated the small, easily plugged passages associated with PCV 522, and it appeared that the filter would still remove any particles large enough to plug valve 5228, which was to be used for system pressure control. Satisfactory manual pressure control using valve 522B had been demonstrated during the shutdown.

In the next operation of the fuel loop (EUN 5), fuel salt was circulated for 44 hours with the reactor subcritical or at very low power (100 W) before the power was raised. The evidence is not conclusive, but there was some indication of an increase in flow resistance at valve 522B during this time. Frequent adjustment of the valve was required to maintain reasonable pressure control. The restriction at the charcoal beds, which occurred after one such adjustment, developed quite rapidly and resulted in almost complete plugging of the two beds that were in service (GA and 18). After the reactor drain, which was required because of the failure of the space-cooler motor, it was determined that the auxiliary charcoal bed was also restricted. This bed comes into service automatically during a drain as a backup to relieve any excess gas pressure. The helium in the fuel system was then released through the two standby charcoal beds.

The pressure in the place was significantly higher than normal. With the valve out, the pressure drop was much lower but still higher than for a normal, unrestricted bed. An excess of helium was then forced through the bed for a few minutes, and the pressure drop suddenly decreased. Subsequent pressure-drop measurements under controlled conditions gave values that were normal for an unrestricted bed.

Several gas samples were taken from the fuel loop during this shutdown in an effort to identify some of the plugging constituents. For several days after the drain, all helium flow through the fuel system was stopped, and the helium in the loop was circulated at ~1100°F. The helium in the off-gas holdup volume (170 liters) was stagnant at about 122°F. Three successive pairs of samples were then trapped from the discharge of the holdup volume; each pair of sample traps consisted of a pipe coil at liquid-nitrogen temperature followed by a U-tube filled with molecular sieve material, also at liquid-nitrogen temperature. The first pair of samples was isolated from the gas that had been in the holdup volume by displacing it through the traps with helium from the fuel loop. The helium which entered the holdup volume during this displacement was presumed to be representative of the material circulating in the loop. A second displacement through another pair of traps was used to isolate material from that gas. The purpose of this was to see if any additional material was released from the holdup volume by the increase in temperature.

Entrained gas in the circulating oil tends to accumulate in the volute of the standby oil pump. From the beginning of MSRE operation, it was necessary to prime the standby pump frequently to keep it ready for operation (priming was done routinely once a shift). Observations in a development loop showed that entrainment and frothing in the reservoir were due to the action of a jet pump used to scavenge oil from the bearing housing (using shield plug oil flow to drive the jet) and agitation of oil by the shaft and bearings. In September 1965, the jets on the fuel and coolant pumps were replaced with less powerful jets to decrease entrainment. After this modification, it was possible to reduce the frequency of priming the standby pump to once a week.

After the jets were changed, it was found that changes in fuel pump bearing oil flow or reservoir pressure caused changes in reservoir level, apparently because of holdup of oil in the salt pump motor cavity. Oil from the bearing housing can enter the motor cavity either by leakage past the upper seal or through a passage connecting the motor cavity to the area between the two shaft bearings. Apparently, an excess of flow to the bearing housing causes oil to be forced up into the motor cavity. Although the breather line affords a return to the oil reservoir, it has been found that once the oil collection begins in the motor cavity, it usually continues until either the oil system is shut down completely or the bearing flow is reduced to below normal. (Much more than this could collect without reaching the motor, but normally, action is taken to stop collection at less than a gallon).

Leakage past the lower seal drains to the oil catch tank, which is equipped with a level indicator and which is periodically drained to the waste oil receiver. After the installation and calibration of a siphon tube in the fuel-pump oil catch tank in November, oil was not added to bring the level indicator on scale. The fuel-pump lower-seal leak rate during the months of December and January is therefore not known precisely.

Activation: During power operation in run 4, induced activity in the treated water rose to an unexpectedly high level. Extrapolation of observed radiation levels indicated that at 10 MW, gamma radiation near the heat exchanger in the diesel room would be about 400 mR/hr. Similar levels would exist in the water room. The activity proved to be 12. 4-hr 42K produced in the corrosion inhibitor (2000 ppm of a 75% potassium nitrite, 25% potassium tetraborate mixture). The level indicated that the average flux in the system (about 80% of which is included in the thermal shield) was equivalent to about 7 X 10^2 thermal neutrons em/sec.

A survey of possible cation replacements for potassium led to the choice of lithium, highly enriched in the Li isotope, to minimize tritium production. An adequate amount of lithium nitrite solution was prepared commercially by ion exchange from potassium nitrite and lithium hydroxide. After the 4000-gal treated-water system was diluted with demineralized water to reduce the potassium from 800 to 3 ppm, the desired inhibitor concentration was attained by adding 7Li nitrite, boric acid, and Li.

When the reactor was next operated at power in run 5, objectionable activation occurred again, this time due to 1.0 ppm of sodium which had evidently come in with the demineralized water from the ORNL facility. Condensate was produced at the MSRE with less than 0.1 ppm of sodium, and this was used to dilute the sodium in the treated-water system to 0.3 ppm. The concentrations of sodium and SLi are now low enough so that shielding and zero-leakage containment of the water system will not be.

Flow interruptions occurred several times in the thermal shield slides. It was discovered that when the water supply line was disconnected and water flowed backward through the slides, a significant amount of air came out with the water. The inference drawn was that air could accumulate in the longest slide until reaching the surge tank, particularly when the level was low. Following a drastic reduction in flow through the surge tank (which had been around 30 pm), there were no further instances of flow interruptions.

The secondary containment, that is, the envelope surrounding the reactor and drain-tank cells, was tested and put into service for the first time during this report period. The testing procedure followed generally the MSRE Operating Procedures, Sect. 48. 7. This procedure in.

All lines carrying helium, air, or water into the cells are equipped either with check valves or block valves actuated by radiation monitors. All of these valves were tested in place wherever possible; otherwise, they were removed and bench-tested. Test pressures were 20 psig or more, and leakage rates were required to meet conservative criteria. This work was done concurrently with maintenance before the cells were closed.

Leaks which occurred in the cooling-water system were mostly in the check valves. These were the result of foreign particles, apparently washed out of the system and trapped between the sliding and moving parts of the valves. Two hard-seated valves in the treated-water system had to be replaced, even though the seats were lapped in an effort to get them to seal. One was a check valve with a swinging check, in a water line between the surge tank and condensate tank, and the other was a spring-loaded hand valve on top of the surge tank, which has to contain air. They were replaced with soft-seated valves. The leakage rates on water-containing valves were determined by collecting the leakage, and a flow meter was used to measure air leakage through valves on top of the surge.

The majority of the valves in the helium system of both primary and secondary containment had satisfactory leak rates. Those which had excessive leakage were check valves and were found to have damaged O-rings and/or foreign particles, usually metal chips from machining, in them. After cleaning and installing new O-rings, they were satisfactory. Many of the check valves had to be removed from the system to pressurize them. After reinstalling, the lines were pressurized, and the fittings were checked with a helium leak detector. Leakage rates through the valves were determined by a flowmeter or by displacement of water in a calibrated.

The instrument-air-line block valves, with few exceptions, were found to be satisfactory; however, numerous tube fittings were found to be leaking by checking with a leak-detector solution when the lines were pressurized to check the valves. Several quick disconnects on air lines inside the reactor cell and drain-tank cell were found to be leaking when checked with a leak-detector solution and were repaired. These leaks do not constitute a leak in secondary containment, since each line has a block valve outside the cell. Still, a leak here does affect the cell leak rate when air pressure is on the line to operate the valve.

The butterfly valves in the 30-inch line used for ventilating the cells during maintenance operations were first checked by pressurizing between them. The leakage measured by a flowmeter was excessive, and the valves had to be removed from the system to determine the cause. There was considerable dirt on the rubber seats, and once these seats were cleaned and repaired, we found that the motor drive units would slip on their mounting plates by a small amount, thus causing a slight error in the indicated position of the valve. Dowels were installed in the mounting plates to prevent this. Small leaks were also.

Found around the pins which fasten the butterfly to the operating shaft, these leaks were repaired with epoxy resin. The line from the thermal shield rupture disks to the vapor-condensing systems has numerous threaded joints that leaked badly when pressurized with nitrogen. Each joint was broken; the threads were coated with epoxy resin, and the joint was remade. All joints were leak-tight when rechecked with leak detector solution.

When closing the cells, all membrane welds were dye-checked. No leaks were found in the welds. The reactor access cover plate, which has a double O-ring seal, was found to be tight by pressurizing between the O-rings.

With the cells at 1 psig, all penetrations, pipe joints, tube fittings, and mineral-insulated (MI) electrical cable seals subjected to this pressure were checked with leak detector solution. Numerous leaks were found in tube fittings and MI cable seals, and the leak rate was about 4500 ft/day, indicating a major leak. Many of the small leaks were stopped by simply tightening the threaded parts of the seal; however, the leak rate was still about 4500 ft/day.

The cells were then pressurized to 5 psig, and leak hunting continued. Three large leaks were located: one in the sleeve of line 522, the off-gas line from the pump bowl to the carbon beds under the bent house floor; another in an instrument air line to valve ECV 523; and another from the vapor-condensing system to the steam domes and out to the north equipment service area through a line that was temporarily open. All penetrations, tube fittings, and MI cable seals were again checked with leak-detector solution. Many MI cable seals which had not leaked at 1 psig were found to be leaking, and some of those which had been tightened and sealed at 1 psig now leaked.

The hook gauge being used to monitor the leakage rate, along with conventional pressure gauges, did not work properly, and the trouble was found to be the result of extremely small leaks in the tube fittings on the reference volume side of the system. This, and temperature changes in the coolant drain-tank cell and special equipment room, caused appreciable difficulty in determining the leakage rate. The piping to the hook gauge was eventually replaced with virtually all welded tubing. These measures considerably improved the reliability of the data.

The MI cable seals as a group accounted for a large percentage of the remaining leaks. Many were sealed by tightening, but many of them required tightening more than once. As a result, several of the gland nuts split, and soldering was required. All large leaks were sealed or greatly reduced, and many of the small leaks were stopped. To stop these and other small leaks which may not have been located, all MI cable seals were coated with epoxy resin at the seals outside of the cells. Teflon tape, used extensively on MI cable seals, other threaded pipe, and tube fittings, did not perform satisfactorily in providing a gas.

After stopping or reducing the leaks in the MI cable seals and instrument air lines, testing was begun at 10, 20, and 30 psig. At these higher pressures, large leaks were located in both component coolant pump dome flanges by leak detector solution, and one of them was audible. To correct these leaks, the width of the gasket was reduced to increase the loading pressure on the gasket. All penetrations, MI cable seals, tube fittings, and external parts of valves, which are part of the secondary containment, were checked with leak detector solution at each of the above.

In each of these tests, the containment system was pressurized to a specific pressure. Then all gas additions and controlled exhausts were stopped, and the leak rate was measured by the change in pressure corrected for changes in temperature. The calculated leakage rates are.

The leakage rate is acceptable if it is 1% per day of the contained gases under the conditions of the maximum credible accident. Also shown is a highly conservative linear relationship for leakage rate vs. pressure. The data taken during the leak-rate tests at 10, 20, and 30 psig are all well within the bounds of these curves. Although the data at -2 psig indicate the containment is inadequate for the linear extrapolation, a comprehensive examination of the data clearly indicated that the leakage rate was acceptable.

Core Access Opening: Convenient access to the control-rod drives and the core access flange is had by removing two 40-in. -diameter plugs in a steel-lined hole in a lower shield block. Originally, a flange on the upper rim of the hole liner was welded to the cell membrane, and a bolted, gasketed cover plate completed the containment. This attachment of the membrane to a lower block presented a problem that became apparent during testing and led to modification. Because of their great weight, the upper blocks must be supported at their ends, not by the lower blocks. To ensure this, there is necessarily some clearance between the upper blocks and the membrane, which normally lies on the lower blocks. When the cell is pressurized, therefore, the membrane lifts up until it contacts the upper blocks. This it was free to do everywhere except around the access opening, where it was fastened to the flange. Analysis showed that this situation would produce excessive stresses when the cell was pressurized for leak testing. Redesign of the liner or flange was impractical, so the membrane was cut loose from the flange, and an overlapping patch was welded on the membrane. This patch must now be cut off whenever access is required.

Inside the area fence along the HFIR access road, and at least 8 ft of earth was provided on the road side to give complete protection to passersby under the worst conditions. Before the tanks were covered, all penetrations were helium leak-tested and found to be tight. Then during the reactor cell leak test, the vapor-condensing system was leak-tested at 30 psig, and a leakage rate of only 5. 5 ft³/day was measured from the 6800-ft system.

Ventilation of Coolant Cell. The cell housing the coolant-salt system is connected to the building ventilation system by a duct which exhausts 5500 cfm of air. This was enough to maintain a negative pressure in the area until the radiator blowers were put into operation. Then air leakage from the radiator enclosure exceeded the cell exhaust capacity. Even after considerable work on the enclosure, the leakage was too much.

To alleviate the situation, the inlet of the south annulus blower was connected to the coolant drain tank cell by ductwork. This blower can now return about 7400 cfm of air to the duct leading to the coolant stack. Now, when the annulus blower is used to supplement the regular exhaust, the main radiator blowers can be operated without raising the coolant cell pressure above atmospheric.

Complete radiation surveys of the reactor area were made at each discussed. Scattering of fast neutrons and gamma rays from the reactor cell into the coolant drain cell through the 30-in. cell ventilation line caused excessive dose rates outside the access door. A wall of 16 in. of concrete block and 6 in. of borated polyethylene was built in the coolant drain cell to reduce dose rates at the door to acceptable values. (The door is locked during nuclear operation to prevent entry into the cell. ) Gamma radiation from the fuel off-gas line in a 3-ft gap between the reactor building and the vent house required earth shielding, as had been expected. We also expected that additional shielding would be required directly above the reactor, where there are large cracks between the shield blocks. However, present indications are that the shielding there will be adequate.

The original radiator doors proved inadequate in that they bowed and jammed when the radiator was heated. In August 1965, doors of improved design were installed. Tests showed that these doors deformed far less when hot and suffered none of the permanent warping of the first doors. Heat losses due to air leakage around the doors continued to present a problem, however. Before all parts of the radiator tubes could be gotten into an acceptable temperature range for filling with salt, it was necessary to work out several minor changes. These included shimming the gasket to conform to the complex bowing of the doors and enclosure and changing the heater wiring to give a nonuniform heat input over the face of the radiator.

At first, the new doors did not move freely. On separate occasions, both doors hung low and failed to lower, leading to snarling and kinking of the lifting cables. Reliable, free movement of the doors was attained only after several revisions. The seal strips were modified to eliminate.

Digging into the asbestos and metal gasket and were attached more securely to the doors after the strips warped and broke in several places. The upper limit switch arrangement was changed to prevent hang-ups due to over-travel. The door guide rollers were changed to eliminate binding. More clearance between the moving doors and the enclosure was provided by moving the guide tracks and modifying the closing cams, which force the doors in against the enclosure at the bottom of their travel.

When the main blowers were operated to test the doors, other difficulties became apparent. Air leakage from the sheet metal enclosure was clearly excessive (about 10,000 cfm), even though the original design had been modified to include hoods into which the doors were raised. The leakage was reduced by installing asbestos cloth boots around the cables, applying sheet metal to some gaps, and packing insulation in others. Even so, the leakage required an increase in the cell exhaust capacity to prevent pressurization of the cell. Leakage of hot air into the region just above the enclosure caused overheating of electrical insulation on the numerous thermocouples and power leads in this vicinity. The problem was compounded because the new door hoods blocked the circulation of air from the cell coolers. Flexible ducts and vanes were used to redirect cool airflow over the leads and the lifting mechanisms. See "Component Development" for additional information about the modifications.

After the improvements in the door seals, air leakage through the radiator was manageable, but it was still considerable. Stack draft alone pulled enough air around the closed doors to make the heat losses (and required heater settings) sensitive to the wind outside and the position of the radiator bypass damper. It was found that the door-seal leakage also depended on whether the doors had been slammed or were lowered normally. The first operation at 1 MW (in run 4) was with one main blower on, the bypass open, the outlet door raised 15 in. , and the inlet door all the way down.

During the 1-MW operation in run 4, salt froze in the lines connected to FT 201, the venturi flowmeter located in the upper part of the radiator enclosure. With the blower on, cool air leakage past the element made it necessary to turn on local heaters to prevent freezing. When the blower was stopped, the heaters had to be turned down to avoid overheating. It appeared likely that in higher-power operation, with greater air pressure in the radiator, the element could not be kept from freezing. Therefore, between runs 4 and 5, the top of the enclosure was cut open, part of the stacked-block insulation was removed, and fibrous insulation protected by shim stock was installed around the element. Operation in run 5 indicated that the insulation was then adequate.

A faulty thermocouple led to the failure of two elements in H 106-1, a heater on the fuel drain line to drain tank 2, in October 1965. Investigation of an anomalous drop in current showed that two elements had failed after a lengthy period in which the heater was operating near the maximum power (about 50% higher than other heaters in similar locations). The thermocouple, whose reading was used to set the heater, was then checked. One lead was grounded in the shield, causing the indicated temperature to be 400°F low. X-rays showed that about 1 in. of resistance wire in the two failed elements had melted. Inspection of the pipe showed no damage from the abnormally high temperature.

The motor on the drain-cell cooler failed at the end of run 5 after about 2900 hours of operation. The cooler was removed, and examination showed that the rotor had slipped along the shaft until the rotor fan blades rubbed, causing the stator windings to overheat and be destroyed. Normally, a force of 2 or 3 tons is required to force the shaft out of a rotor of this size.

Component Cooling Pumps. The two component cooling pumps are large, positive-displacement blowers which supply cooling air to freeze valves and other equipment in the reactor and drain-tank cells. Whenever the fuel system is hot, one pump is kept in operation, with the other on standby. By the end of February 1966, CCP 1 had operated 4995 hr, CCP 2 had operated only 1620 hr.

The drive belts on CCP 2 broke after 1454 hours of operation and again after 11 additional hours. The belts had been operated at loadings in excess of their rating since the beginning of operation when the sheaves were changed to reduce blower speed. After this was recognized, following the second failure, the sheaves and belts were replaced with a poly.

At the time of the second failure of the CCP-2 belts, it was discovered that the discharge check valve on this blower was inoperative. This valve is a 6-inch butterfly-type valve with an elastomer hinge holding two flappers in place. The hinge had broken, allowing one flapper to fall off. The result was that CCP-2 "motored because of reverse flow when CCP-1 was operated. " The check valve was rebuilt and reinstalled.

Diesel Generators. Three diesel-powered generators, each with a capacity of 300 kW, supply emergency AC power to motors and heaters in the MSRE. There has been no occasion on which this emergency power was needed. The diesels are started once a week, and once a month they are operated under partial load. They have also been operated during planned power outages for up to 6 hours.

In November 1965, coolant leaked into the crankcase of DG 3, and it was found that an imperfect head made a tight seal between the head and block impossible. The head was replaced, and the bolts torqued to the manufacturer's specifications. In February, a crack was found in the cylinder. The attempt was only partly successful, and stop-leak compound was needed to halt slight seepage from a crack adjacent to the weld. Further attempts at repair are deemed inadvisable, and the expense of a new block does not appear justifiable in view of the purpose of DG 3. If it were to fail when called on for emergency power, it would, at worst, cause delay and inconvenience but no system damage. Presently, DG 3 is tested routinely with the other diesels, but the crankcase oil is monitored especially carefully for traces of coolant.

Air Compressors. Compressed air at the MSRE is supplied by three reciprocating air compressors. Two of the compressors, AC 1 and AC 2, provide instrument air. The other, AC 3, supplies air for service needs and, in emergencies, can supply air to the instrument system.

The service air compressor is an 8-inch bore, 7-inch stroke, 514 rpm machine with Teflon rings, installed new in 1962. In more than three years of service, it failed once in 1964 when blockage of the aftercooler discharge line by a failed check valve led to excessive pressure and a head gasket failure.

The instrument air compressors are also 8-in. -bore, 7-in. -stroke machines, but they were originally equipped with carbon rings and operated at 600 rpm. Both had been used elsewhere, and both had been overhauled and equipped with Teflon rings before being placed in service at the MSRE in 1964. Through January 1966, six head gasket failures had occurred in these two compressors; three on each compressor.

The load was slightly above normal (but still within the specified range). This was attributed to binding of the Teflon piston rings, which was observed at times after brief operation at rated load. When the rings began to bind, the cylinder liner apparently overheated, expanding axially and deforming the head gasket. Water then leaked from the cooling passages into the cylinder when the compressor cooled, and the cylinder liner shrank. The compressor manufacturer now recommends a maximum speed of 514 rpm on 7-in. -stroke compressors; apparently, piston speeds at 600 rpm were too high after Teflon rings were substituted for carbon. It was possible to reduce the speed on AC 1 and AC 2 to 512 rpm and still meet the requirements for instrument airflow. This change was made, therefore, by changing the drive sheaves and belts, and apparently, the binding and overheating were eliminated.

The fuel pump rotary element was removed for inspection after the flush salt circulation at the end of run 3. The pump was checked for dimensional changes, deposits, corrosion, or erosion of hydraulic parts, and for rubbing of close-clearance running fits.

The pump was generally in good condition, and nothing was found that would interfere with the satisfactory operation of the pump. There was no indication of rubbing of the running fits or of corrosion or erosion growth of the pump tank bore diameter where the upper O-ring mates with the pump tank.

The dark stains on the shield plug are the results of an oil leak through the gasketed joint at the catch basin for the lower oil seal. This oil had run down the surface of the shield plug, where it had become coked by the higher temperatures near the bottom. Some of the oil had reached the upper O-ring groove at the bottom of the shield plug and had become coked in the groove, but none appeared to have leaked past the O-ring during high-temperature operation.

The photograph also shows part of a deposit of flush salt that failed to drain from the labyrinth flange just above the impeller. Calculations of fission product activity after high-power operation indicated that this incomplete drainage would not increase the maintenance hazard significantly, provided flush salt is circulated to flush fuel from this location prior to the removal. There were also deposits of salt that contained fuel in both the upper and lower O-ring grooves. These deposits would not be effectively diluted during flush salt operation and would constitute the major radiation source during maintenance.

The parts of the rotary element that had been in contact with the salt had clean, bare metal surfaces, while the parts exposed to the gas had a thin black film. There was an abrupt transition, which may be seen in. 18, between the two types of surface, but this transition was slightly above the actual level. The salt deposit above the labyrinth flange and a smaller salt deposit in the pump volute were also partially covered with a thin black film.

The pump was reinstalled using remote maintenance techniques so that these techniques and procedures could be evaluated. Four universal joints on the flange bolts that had been found broken during the disassembly were repaired prior to the reinstallation of the rotary element. The failures resulted from excessive bolting torque that had been used earlier to obtain an initial seal on the flange.

After the reactor vessel was installed, tests of Hastelloy N from the heats used in the vessel showed that the closure weld between the top head and the flow distributor ring would be expected to have poor mechanical properties in the as-welded condition. Further tests showed that the rupture life and ductility, which were unacceptably low, could.

Temperatures were monitored by six thermocouples evenly spaced around the vessel just below the weld. Because of gaps in the shroud of vertical heater tubes around the vessel, a perfectly uniform temperature could not be attained. A day was spent at about 1300°F adjusting heaters to minimize the temperature spread. Then for 90 hours, the lowest temperature was held at 1400 ± 20°F, while the hottest thermocouple was at 1460 ± 20°F. After the vessel was cooled at the end of the treatment, inspection showed that the furnace and insulation were undamaged.

The MSRE fuel system was designed for the fuel pump and the heat exchanger to move horizontally and vertically. This was done to keep the stresses low in the piping and equipment nozzles while accommodating the expansion and contraction of the closely coupled system as it is cycled between 150 and 1300°F. During the prenuclear and critical testing, we found that the pump mount could not be depended on to move vertically. At the same time, we learned that the creep properties of the metal in the reactor vessel and the piping inside the thermal shield would deteriorate with neutron irradiation. The latter requires that the stresses be kept low when the reactor is at high temperature, although normal design stresses are permissible below about 800°F.

According to our calculations, acceptable stresses at the reactor vessel nozzles could be obtained by raising the pump 1/2 in. and the heat exchanger 1/4 in. from their existing cold positions and fixing them against further vertical movement. This cold springing would result in the stresses being high at low temperature, and expansion of the piping on heating would lower the stress as the temperature is raised.

The changes were made as indicated above, and the fuel system was heated to 1200°F. There was no appreciable vertical movement of the heat exchanger on the spring supports where a downward movement of 0.1 in. had been expected.

After the system was cooled, strain gauges were installed on the heat exchanger nozzle and on the piping to the pump. The heat exchanger was raised and lowered about 1/8 in. while the forces on the spring supports and the strains were measured. We concluded that the spring mounting should act to relieve any large vertical forces on the nozzle and that the revised installation was satisfactory.

Formal design of the MSR instrumentation and controls system is now complete. Some provide additional system protection, but in the majority of cases, the purpose is to improve performance and provide more information for the operator. A few minor design errors were corrected, and some instrumentation was added to simplify maintenance procedures. Except for some specification sheet revisions and preparation of a design report, documentation is complete.

The model Q-2623 relay safety element was modified by substituting the 115-V AC relays with 32-V DC relays. This change eliminated AC pickup on the other modules through which relay coil current is routed, reducing the likelihood of spurious trips. This adjustment is particularly beneficial when the Q-2602 flux amplifier trip points are decreased by a factor of 1000, from 15 MW to 15 kW of reactor power.

Dynamic braking circuitry for rod drive 1 (servo-controlled road) has been designed, built, and tested with installation scheduled for March 1966. Braking action is obtained by discharging direct current from a capacitor through the motor field windings when the drive motor is turned off. This brake will provide a substantial reduction in coasting of the rod drive after the power is switched off. As a result, it will take less back-and-forth jogging to get small increments of rod motion when manually shimming. Servo performance is expected to improve for the same reason.

To ensure proper drainage, additions and revisions to existing safety circuits were designed to open the fuel drain-tank vent valves upon a signal from high neutron flux (SERAM) and keep them open until a manual reset is used to allow reclosing.

Reactor power and period information from these two fission counter channels provide interlocks that govern permissible reactor power levels (control system modes) and reactor fill, which prohibit rod withdrawal during start and provide control-rod reverse action.

Very generally and typically, reactor period signals from counting channels operating at low input levels are characterized by slow response. This inherent delay produced a problem with servo-controlled rod withdrawal during start. In a servo-controlled start, the demand signal causes the regulating rod to withdraw until the period-controlled withdraw inhibit interlock operates. If the period continues to decrease, the reverse interlock acts to insert the rods in direct opposition to the servo demand. These "withdraw inhibit" and "reverse trip" points were originally established at periods of +20 and 410 seconds, respectively. The delayed low-level response of the inhibit interlock allowed sufficient incremental rod withdrawal to produce a 10-second period and thus cause a reverse.

As remedial measures, the withdrawal, inhibit, and reverse period trip points were changed to +5 and +25 sec, respectively. An electromechanical clutch-brake was inserted in the shim-locating motor-drive train. The dynamic brake described above is also expected to reduce this period overshoot problem.

Provision for testing the period and log power interlock trips in the wide-range counting channels was provided. Testing is done routinely by Instrumentation and Controls Division maintenance personnel and is accomplished by push buttons inside the instrument chassis.

We assumed that the neutron flux in the instrument penetrations would tend to decrease exponentially with increasing distance from the core vessel. This implies that most of the flux within the penetration originates with neutrons entering the lower end face of the penetration. Figure 1.19 shows that concrete shielding was added in an effort to shield the penetration from other sources of neutron flux. The vernistat in the wide-range counting channels model Q-2616 function generator will compensate for any reasonable departure from an exact exponential attenuation of flux; however, it became apparent during the first series of critical experiments that flux attenuation within the instrument penetration was deviating grossly from the assumed exponential curve.

Penetration in guide tube 6. It was reasonable to conclude from this, and from similar curves, that the excess neutrons responsible for the distorted part of the curve were entering the penetration along its length. The count rates in other guide tubes nearer the upper half of the guide tube were even more distorted than curve A.

A flux field with attenuation per curve precludes successful operation of the wide-range counting instrumentation. We decided to shield the fission counters from stray, side-entry neutrons with shields of sheet cadmium, which were inserted into guide tubes 6 and 9. As a counter travels up a guide tube during withdrawal, it first enters a partially shielded section of the guide tube. The partial shielding is obtained by using wedge-shaped strips of cadmium laid around the guide tube, which provide.

Ever-increasing shielding from side-entry neutrons as the counter is withdrawn. The bases of these long narrow wedges occupy the full periphery of the shield tube at its upper end and thereby provide a smooth transition to the 100% wraparound cadmium sleeve which follows. This shielding, 0. 20, was an eminently successful answer to the problem. Curve B, normalized count rate vs. distance, was obtained after this shield was installed in guide tube 6.

Because of very unfavorable geometry, the strongest practicable neutron source would not produce 2 counts/sec from the fission counters in the wide-range counting channels until the core vessel was approximately half full of fuel salt; neither would it produce 2 counts/sec with flush salt in the core at any level. This is the minimum count rate required to obtain the permissive “confidence interlock," which allows filling the core vessel and withdrawing the rods. Therefore, a counting channel using a sensitive BF3 counter was added to establish confidence when the core vessel is less than half filled with fuel salt. With the revised system, a fuel-salt fill may begin when the reactor vessel is empty if BF3 count.

The reactor building radiation and contamination warning system was revised to correct some deficiencies and to improve its effectiveness, as indicated by tests and experience during reactor power operation. An alarm relay was installed in the personnel and stack monitor alarm system circuitry to provide an annunciation upon the loss of the 24-volt DC power supply. Monitron RE-7012, located in the south end of the high bay, was moved east about 20 ft to monitor for possible radiation escaping from the nuclear instrument penetration. CAM RE-7001 was moved closer to the sampler-enricher to monitor its operation. Several of the Q-2091 beta-gamma monitors were relocated to provide more protection. One unit was installed in the instrument shop, one unit was removed from the health physics office and installed in the hall between Buildings 7503 and 7509, and the unit in the vent house was relocated to reduce its background response from lines in the vent house. Two additional air horns were added to increase the area covered by the horn evacuation signal. One horn was installed on the southeast corner of Building 7509, and the other in the diesel house. Four additional beacon alarm lights were installed in areas where the horn might not be heard. A light was installed in the vent house, cooling-water equipment room, the switch house, and the Plant.

Containment: To maintain the integrity of the reactor secondary containment, solenoid block valves with safety-grade wiring were installed in the fuel-drain-tank steam dome drain piping. These valves are interlocked to close when reactor cell air activity or pressure is above limits. The interlocks override a manual switch used for normal operation of the steam dome drain system. Actuating signals were obtained from existing circuits.

Safety-grade control circuits were installed to operate four weld-sealed solenoid valves serving the fuel off-gas sample system. The valves are specially designed and constructed for use on MSK# containment systems and are identical to those previously purchased for use in the fuel-pump-bowl bubbler level system. The procurement of four additional valves from a commercial source is nearing completion.

Fuel Sampler-Enricher: The fuel sampler-enricher safety-grade control circuits were revised to increase the reliability of the two containment barriers between the primary system (fuel pump bowl) and the operator. Originally, the circuits were designed so that the sample access port could be opened if either the operational valve or the maintenance valve was closed. If this had occurred when the manipulator cover was removed, the manipulator boot could have become the only containment barrier between the operator and the fuel pump bowl. Since the boot could be ruptured by system pressures in excess of 10 psig, this condition was considered hazardous. The position of the cover is detected by a newly installed vacuum pressure switch.

In both the fuel and coolant salt circulating pump circuits, the existing pump bowl level switch actuation valve was changed to reduce the level at which the pump is stopped, and one new switch was installed to prevent pump startup until the normal fill level is reached. Since the salt level drops 8 to 12% after pump startup, the single.

Jumpers were added around the coolant salt system helium off-gas radiation contacts in the fuel pump circuit to prevent the pump from stopping each time a circuit test is conducted. The radiation monitor is a safety-grade device, and its primary function is to initiate an emergency drain. Both channels must be tested routinely.

Fuel Processing System. A mass flow-rate meter was installed to indicate the flow of HF to the fuel storage tank during fuel processing operations. The purpose of this second flow measurement is to provide an independent check on the existing orifice meter because the HF flow rate is important in calculating the amount of oxide removed from the.

Control System - Relays. Little or no trouble has been experienced. Virtually all design changes to the relay control gear have been made to meet new requirements developed by operating experience, not to correct malfunctions of this equipment.

Valves. The difficulty experienced with the pressure control valve, PCV 522A, in the pump bowl off-gas system is a part of the larger general problem of off-gas contamination by carryover of solids and vapors, which are deposited in the off-gas lines. Valve-selection criteria for the offgas system did not include considering non-gaseous foreign matter in the.

Pressure Transducers. One strain gauge unit in the sampler-enricher suddenly shifted calibration, but during operation returned to its original state. The most likely explanation is moisture which, after getting into the device, was baked out during service.

Thermocouples. Thermocouple performance has been excellent. Only one in-cell thermocouple was lost during the six-month period covered by this report. The plastic insulation on the radiator thermocouple lead wires suffered from local temperatures, which were substantially in excess of those anticipated.

Of the differential pressure-sensing instruments, the failure was a leaky connection caused by weak weldments fabricated by the vendor and used to attach autoclave fittings to the pressure inlet tubing. With the assistance of the Metals and Ceramics Division, the weldment was redesigned and rewelded. No further difficulties have been experienced.

Manometer readout is accomplished by selecting a particular weigh cell channel with pneumatic selector valves. The valves are composed of a stacked array of individual valves operated by cams on the operating handle shaft. The valves leak; proposals to eliminate the problem are being considered.

Nuclear Safety Instrumentation. The electronic instruments have given little trouble. The solid-state modular instruments, hitherto untried in an operating installation, have needed very little service, and no major problems have developed with use. Channel 3 of the safety system produced an abnormal number of spurious trips. A large number of these are believed to have originated in faulty, vibration-sensitive relays in a commercial electronic switch which provides the high-temperature trip signal in the channel. Vibration isolation and substitution of a different relay are being considered as possible antidotes. This has been corrected. Very generally, the source of spurious trips has been difficult to trace, since they are random and usually appear to be unrelated to events elsewhere in the reactor system. As electrical noise-producing components elsewhere in the system are eliminated, the number of false trips is expected to be reduced.

Wide-Range Counting Channels. Moisture penetration has been experienced with the wide-range counting channel snake assembly. An improved waterproof jacket is expected to cure this affliction.

Linear Power Channels and Servo Controller. The compensated ion chambers use a small electric motor to change compensation. One motor drive has given some trouble and has been responsible for the maintenance required by these chambers. The servo rod controller has been used for automatic control in both the flux and temperature modes. Excepting the problem associated with the wide-range counting channel, the servo's performance was very satisfactory.

False alarms from the Monitron in the East Service Tumiel were traced to electrical noise from the sampler-enricher vacuum pumps. An electrical noise filter is being designed to remedy this. A faulty solid-state switch in the sampler-enricher was responsible for the noise in the output of the.

The installation of extensive modifications to the data logger computer was completed on August 31, 1965, and testing began immediately. Several failed computer components were found and replaced, and two loose connections in the analog input system were found and repaired. Additions, design changes, and adjustments were required as a result of the modifications, and, with the exception of the digital filter-integrator, which required complete redesign, these changes and testing were completed on September 16. The seven-day acceptance test was restarted on September 16, 1965, and completed on September 23, 1965. The remainder of September was spent correcting miscellaneous hardware problems, principally loose circuit card connections. An air-conditioning failure caused the computer room ambient temperature to rise to 85°F, and, simultaneously, the AC supply voltage fell to 103 V. These two conditions, although simultaneous, were not coupled. In these circumstances, it was impossible to keep the system online for more than a few hours at a time.

Satisfactory operation was restored, and the system was accepted on October 1, 1965, provided that Bunker-Ramo Corporation (1) supplies and installs a digital filter-integrator for the analog input signals and (2) provides and installs, at ORNL's option, circuitry which prevents damage to the core memory by restart transients subsequent to a power loss and which provides 4 controlled sequence automatic restart when power is restored.

October was spent checking and calibrating in-house instrumentation and troubleshooting hardware failures, principally in the analog input area of the system. Instrument calibrations were completed in November, as were substantial modifications to improve reliability scheduled by Bunker-Ramo. The digital filter-integrator and restart circuitry were also installed during this shutdown.

In the period of December 1965 through February 1966, the logger-computer achieved operating status. In addition to the routine and periodic collection of operating data, it was used to obtain transient and frequency responses and to determine fuel temperature coefficients of reactivity. It was programmed to operate the control rod for the pseudorandom binary tests reported in MSRE Dynamic Tests, this report. During this period, the various computing and logging programs were being modified in accordance with the requirements developed during reactor operation.

Figure 1. 22 charts, on a weekly basis, the in-service or on-time as a percent of total time. The shaded areas on the figure are scheduled shutdowns and cannot be charged against the system as malfunctions. The period immediately following system acceptance, performance, as noted above, was disappointingly low and did not approach the specified requirements. The system has shown a slow but steady overall improvement in operating reliability as debugging progressed.

Two general-purpose, portable EKAT-TR-10 analog computers were tied in with the reactor instrumentation system. No special hardware was required. The control of the simulator was effected entirely from the operator's console, where actual rod motion, radiator door positioning, and blower.

Except for some revisions and additions to the instrument specification sheet and preparation of a design report, documentation of the MORE instrumentation and controls system design is complete. During the past report period, instrument application and switch tabulations were completed and issued, and design drawings were revised to incorporate as-built revisions and recent additions to and revisions of the system.

Control rod: Units 1 and 2 have operated without difficulty since the initial installation at the reactor. Examination of rod 3 at the end of the criticality tests revealed that the braided wire sheath had been torn at a point 28 in. below the tow block. The inner convoluted hose was worn but not completely through the wall. The cause of the damage appeared to be the upper roller in the control rod thimble, which had jammed and would not rotate. The roller had a galled flat area on one side. The thimble roller and upper control rod hose were replaced. Recent examination indicated no further difficulty after several months of operation.

Thermal switches were installed in the lower end of the drive housing and are set to alarm when the temperature rises above 200°F. The airflow through the drive unit cases is about 1. 4 scfm, which appears to be adequate to maintain the temperature within the housings at less than 200°F.

It was necessary to replace the No. 3 drive unit because the position deviation was caused by a partially restricted spring action of the preload spring operator of the drive chain. This allowed enough slack in the drive chain to permit the chain links to slip over the sprocket gear, error until replaced.

The lower limit switch of unit No. 3 showed an intermittent tendency to stick when the control rod was dropped from above 24 in. The switch could be released by fully withdrawing the control rod. , to overcome the force of the actuator recovery spring to a point where the lower end of the actuating rod could strike the lower flange of the drive unit. The actuating rod had been slightly bent due to striking the flange, causing it to bind in the guide bushing. A stronger recovery spring will be installed to prevent the overtravel.

Figure 2. 1 is a photograph of the control rod drive units in position on the reactor. This method of removal has been utilized for control rod maintenance since the initial installation at the reactor.

The door tripped locks. The locks were modified and adjusted so that when the door was fully closed, the tripped locks forced the metal door, by a forward camming action, against the soft seal on the face of the radiator enclosure. The forward force is exerted by movement of the door in the downward direction into the rolling cam locks located on the radiator frame.

Door guide tracks. The door moved too close to the radiator seals when it was raised or lowered. Warpage of the door caused some of the seal elements to hang on the door, and they were torn loose. The position of the door track was moved to provide 1 in. of clearance between the seals and the face of the door when the door was released from the fully closed position.

Cam follower bracket. The doors tended to drag and jam in the guide tracks. Cams had been installed in the tracks to force the doors away from the seals when they were not fully closed. The cam follower brackets are mounted on the doors and contain rollers which ride on the track cams. These rollers were damaged by the wedging action of the trip locks against the door rollers and tracks when the doors were dropped into the closed position. The cams were changed to provide clearances of 1/8 in.

Reliable operation of the limit switches is important in reducing the number of ways in which the doors can malfunction, and the original switches were not very reliable. New heavy-duty switches and actuators were installed to obtain more positive action. An additional upper limit safety switch was added, plus a mechanical “hard stop above the added upper limit switch. In the event of complete switch failure, the door strikes the hard stop, and an overload switch stops the drive motor before the door seals can be damaged.

The door position indicators are synchro-driven devices located on the drive shafts. If the doors jam while being lowered, the sheaves continue to turn and give incorrect indications of the true door positions. Continued action of the drive unit after the doors have stopped moving causes the lifting cables to unwind from the sheaves and attempt to rewind in the reverse direction. The cables usually jump out of the grooves in the sheaves and become snarled and kinked.

When the clearance between the door and door seals was changed to 1 inch with the door open (see No. The hoods on both the inlet and outlet doors were shifted 1-1/2 inches to provide this clearance.

The electrical leads from the radiator heaters extended vertically up through the radiator enclosure and terminated in junction boxes on the floor of the area between the radiator door hoods. These leads are insulated with ceramic beads.

The heat leakage into this area was reduced by welding the original sheet-metal enclosure wherever possible, by patching some openings, and by re-insulating. The junction boxes were removed from the high-temperature area between the hoods to a cooler position on the east wall of the penthouse. Electrical wire extensions between the relocated junction boxes and the beaded heater lead wires were insulated with 194°F thermoplastic and asbestos composition. Figure 2. 3 shows the present arrangement of the heater wiring between the hoods over the radiator doors.

Of the existing exhaust ducts, cool air is directed downward through the drive mechanism into the heater lead area. Exhaust ducts remove the heated air from the floor between the hoods. The south exhaust duct can be seen in Fig. 3. There are two additional exhaust ducts on the north end of the area; these are 10-inch-diameter flexible tubes. Also, a duct was installed between the door hoods so the hoods will be cooled when the main blowers are running.

The average ambient temperature in the area between the doors after the above modifications was approximately 100°F with the blowers off. These temperatures are satisfactory, and the temperatures were also satisfactory with the blowers.

During the shutdown period following run 3, the low-power experiment, several modifications were made to the sampler-enricher to increase the efficiency of operation. Most of these were discussed in the previous semiannual report. The major modifications made at that time included: (1) replacing the removal valve with a modified version, (2) adding a knob to one linkage pin of each access port operator to aid in opening it with the manipulator if it should fail to function properly, (3) putting steel rings in the convolutions of the manipulator inner boot to hold it free of the manipulator arm, and (4) adding a pressure switch to prevent an excessive pressure gradient across the manipulator boot.

The manipulator arm, which was bent during run 3, was replaced. The hand was straightened, and a 1/4 x 1/4-inch projection was welded to the bottom of each finger to aid in handling the capsule cable. Clearances in the Castle joint were increased to reduce the force needed to operate.

Additional changes have been made to improve the reliability of operation. The brass keys used to attach the capsules to the latch were replaced with nickel-plated mild steel keys. In case a capsule is dropped, it can now be retrieved with a magnet.

During runs 4 and 5, 40 samples were taken, 9 of which were 50-g samples for oxygen analysis in place of the usual 10-g samples. Two of the large capsules failed to trap a sample. The first assembly was not long enough to submerge the fill opening of the capsule in salt in the pump bowl. All other assemblies were made longer. The second failure to trap a sample probably resulted from the capsule catching on the latch stop at the top of the pump and not entering the pump bowl. The capsule has been modified slightly to make it hang straighter and is therefore less apt to hang.

While withdrawing one of the 10-g capsules, the position indicator stopped, indicating that the capsule had hung or the cable had jammed. After repeated attempts, the cable was withdrawn completely. The cable was examined to determine the cause of trouble. Apparently, the capsule or latch had hung on the gate of the maintenance or operational valve, causing the cable to coil up. The cable also backed up into the drive unit box and caught in the motor gears. The cable was straightened, the open limit switches on the operational and maintenance valves were reset to open the valves wider, and the outside diameter of the latch was reduced. No similar trouble has been experienced.

The equilibrium buffer pressure to the operational valve dropped from 55 to 35 psia during one sampling operation. This represents a leak of about 20 cc He/min through the seal on the upper gate of the valve. A particle of salt or metal apparently dropped on the gate while the capsule was being removed or attached to the latch and lodged between the gate and the seat. Repeated efforts to blow the particle from the sealing surface have failed. The leak rate has not increased with continued use. The leak of helium from the buffer system is mainly an inconvenience, as it slowly pressurizes the volume above the valve, and the gas must be vented to the auxiliary charcoal bed about once a day. Besides this seal, three more sealing surfaces between the pump bowl and the sample access area provide adequate safety; therefore, the valve will not be replaced at this time.

The sample capsule used while the reactor was operating at 1 MW left considerable contamination in the transport container. The open end of the bottom cup read 40 vfar near contact after the capsule was removed. Replaceable liners have been fabricated to reduce the contamination left in the transport container.

During runs 4 and 5, ten samples were isolated from the coolant pump bowl; two of which were 50-g samples. During one sampling, the latch failed to slide freely through the transfer tube. No reason for the difficulty could be found, but the outside diameter of the latch was reduced to lessen the possibility of future trouble.

When the capsule was retrieved from the pump bowl in taking the first sample of run 4 (cp-4-1), a black film covered the salt and adhered to it. The sampler was opened and examined for oil contamination. A small amount was found on the top flange of the glove box near the elastomer gasket. No evidence of oil was found around the drive unit or capsule. The source of the oil was not located, but subsequent samples have been free of the film.

The difficulty with plugging and partial restriction in the MSRE off-gas system is described in the section on system's performance. Several of the components which had given trouble during the early operation at 1/2 and 1 MW were removed to the HRLEI for examination. Photographs were taken through periscopes, and many samples of the foreign material found in the components were removed and transferred to the analytical chemistry hot cells for analysis. A summary of the visual examinations made in HRLEL is given below.

The flow restrictor consists of a short length of 0. 08-inch ID tubing, open. The entrance and exit ends of the restrictor tubing were examined. The entrance region was clean, and only a small deposit was found on the container wall near the end of the discharge region. This deposit is shown in Fig. 4. The restrictor was not completely plugged when examined in the hot cell.

The check valve is a small, spring-loaded poppet-type valve installed in the gas line to prevent backflow into the fuel pump gas space during venting operations on the drain tanks. Some foreign material was found on examination of the poppet, but this was not sufficient to stop the gas flow. The valve poppet is shown in Fig. 5, and for the purpose of the examination, is shown in the open position. The soft O-ring, which makes the seal, can also be seen in its normal position on the poppet.

The valve had given indications of almost complete plugging before removal from the system. The valve was cut apart with a saw in the hot cell, and the valve stem is shown in Fig. 6. The small metallic chips shown near the large end of the cone are from the sawing operation. The entire cone was shiny as though wet with an oil-like material. There was some white amorphous powder on the tapered section of the valve trim.

PCV 522 controls the gas overpressure on the reactor system by varying the gas letdown (off-gas flow). The flow passage at the valve seat was quite small (about 0.010 in. ) in order to control the relatively low gas flow (4.2 liters/min). The valve was mounted with the seat above the stem. Flow was down through the seal (reverse of normal). The valve stem was covered with an amber oil-like coating, and there was an accumulation of fluid in the recess formed by the bellows-to-stem adapter piece as shown in Fig. 7. The tapered flat (flow area) on the stem had small accumulations of solid material. The valve body was coated with similar material and had a semisolid mass of material on the surface near the seat port as shown in Fig. 8. Samples of these materials were removed for analyses.

The filter area is 0.34 sq. ft. and the removal rating is 98% for particle flow. The pressure (2 in. H2O) was measured. The filter was installed immediately upstream of the reactor gas pressure control valve (PCV 522) to protect the very fine.

Visual examination was continued on February 10, 1966; at which time it was noted that the frosty white areas had become darker in appearance, tending toward the steel gray. Inspection of the interior of the filter housing showed an accumulation of foreign material in the bottom as shown in Fig. 10. Samples were scraped from the side of the element. The filter was then reassembled, and a flow pressure drop test (see below) was run on February 11, 1966. The filter was once again disassembled, and the element was sectioned into short pieces.

The filter and filter housing, which had been removed from line 522 on February 8, 1966, were tested in the hot cell of the HRIEL as indicated in the flow diagram given in. 11; flow tests were conducted on February 11, 1966. The gas was discharged into the gas disposal filter system of the hot cell. By taking readings of the filter pressure gauge through the hot cell window for various helium flow rates, the relative plugging of the filter was determined.

The data obtained are shown in Fig. 12. The graph also shows the results of a helium flow test conducted on a duplicate but clean filter. The data indicate that for a given pressure difference, the 522 filter was passing only 5% of the corresponding flow of the clean filter. However, extrapolation of the data to the normal MSRE off-gas flow indicates that, even though 95% plugged, the contribution of the filter (0. 075 psi) to the total system pressure drop (5 psi) was negligible.

Functionally, the instrumentation and control of the chemical process sampler is similar to that provided on the fuel sampler-enricher system; however, the detailed design of the chemical process system sampler is simpler. This reduction in complexity resulted from reduced requirements for containment, which, in turn, resulted from the lower radiation levels present in the chemical processing system. The reduced containment requirements permitted the use of conventional (single-tracked) control circuitry instead of the redundant (dual-tracked) safety-grade circuitry used in the fuel sampler-enricher. Also, it was possible, in some cases, to use commercial-grade components instead of special weld-sealed components.

Instrumentation and controls design for the off-gas sampler is in progress and nearing completion. Instrumentation is being provided for online chromatographic and conductivity analysis for measurements of flows, pressures, and temperatures required for proper operation and interpretation of data from the chromatograph and conductivity analyzers for control of the temperature of a molecular sieve trap and of the level of a liquid nitrogen bath in which the molecular sieve is immersed; for detection and annunciation of undesirable operating conditions; and to prevent the occurrence of hazardous conditions.

Since the sampler will be an integral part of the primary containment during sampling operations, and since some components of the sampler would not meet the requirements for primary containment system components, solenoid block valves will be installed in the inlet and outlet lines that connect the sampler to the reactor system. Two valves will be installed in series in each line. These valves will automatically close and isolate the sampler from the reactor system in the event of high pressure in the reactor containment cell, high pressure in the fuel-pump bowl, or high air activity in the sampler enclosure. High reactor cell pressure is indicative of a rupture of the primary containment and the occurrence of the maximum credible accident. Closure of the block valves resulting from high sampler-air activity (and the accompanying alarm) will also provide protection to the sampler operator against the occurrence of high background radiation resulting from small leaks in the sampler.

Air samples collected from and returned to the sampler enclosure. The isolation block valves and associated detecting instruments and control circuitry were designed in accordance with the recommendations of the Systems. At least two independent devices were used to supply input signals to the system and to effect the corrective blocking action. One-out-of-two logic was used in the control circuitry, and separation and identification were maintained in the detail design of the wiring.

Panel-mounted instrumentation will occupy 5 lin. ft of panel (6 ft high x 2 ft deep). These panels will be located in the vent house south of the reactor building. Since all major sampling operations will be carried out at the sampler, all readout of information will be presented at the sampler panels. However, occurrence of an alarm condition at the sampler will actuate an annunciator in the main control room, and provisions are being made to permit some information to be transmitted to the Computer-Data Logger. Also, a sample permissive switch will be located in the main control room. This switch, which is connected in the block valve circuits, will be used to prevent operation of the sampler without knowledge of the reactor operators.

Most of the instrument components used in the off-gas sampler were salvaged from the ORNL MIR-47-6 experiment located at Idaho Falls, or were on hand in ORNL Reactor Division stores. Reconditioning and calibration of this equipment, and procurement of additional components, are nearing completion. Preparation of instrument application drawing is essentially complete. Panel design is approximately 75% complete. Interconnection wiring and piping design is underway, and fabrication of panels is also.

The results of this calculation at equilibrium are shown in Figs. 2. 14a, b, and c, as a function of the variable indicated when all other variables remain constant. The circle on the curve indicates the expected or design value. For this calculation, the core was divided into 72 regions, and average fluxes and adjoint fluxes were used for each region. Figure 2. 14c shows that the poison fraction is considerably lower at low power levels. This is because a higher fraction of 136K6 decays at these power levels. One notable result of the calculation is that the xenon poison fraction did not change in value when the diffusivity of xenon in graphite ranged from 1077 to 5 x 10^75 £4 faz. This is because the mass transfer coefficient from salt to graphite is controlling the transfer process. The final measured +3°Xe poison fraction may be different from these predicted values because of the assumptions involved. As more information is gained about the reactor system and its chemistry, the equations will be adjusted to provide a better model for calculation of the migration in future systems.

The activities of the remote maintenance group were dictated largely by the condition of the reactor. Once the cells were closed, the effort was turned to recording experiences and planning for later.

Practice with reactor components was had in handling the pump rotary element and in changing the existing graphite sample assembly for the final unit. The sampling procedure included the handling and/or operation of (1) an inert atmosphere in the standpipe; (2) a special heater tool to thaw out a frozen salt annulus around the outside of the sample hold-down assembly; (3) disconnects, valves, and flanges inside the standpipe; (4) stowing the hold-down assembly; and (5) the sample itself. In addition to these, a limited visual inspection of the core was conducted using a 7/8-in. -diameter scope. A special fitting had to be installed in the strainer basket above the core to accommodate the revised.

The pump rotary element was lifted out of the cell for inspection using the lifting yoke and crane with in-cell direct guiding. During the lift, clearances of all the auxiliary equipment were observed, and points where damaging interferences could occur were noted. The unit was reinstalled by remote means using the view afforded through the portable maintenance shield. The process of torquing up the twenty-two 1 1/2-inch-diameter bolts in the pump's lower flange was started in the portable shield but was finished with direct means to save time in the reassembly process. While set up in this area, representative electrical and thermocouple disconnects, pump-bowl heaters, and auxiliary flanges were handled with the long-handled tools.

Procedures were revised, and in cases like the pump, graphite sampling, and the control rods were written up in minute detail. Tabulations were prepared relating heaters, thermocouples, spare disconnects, and other equipment with shield-block locations and elevations. Additional tools were designed, and some existing tools were revised.

In January, after a short period of power operation, it was necessary; levels were significantly lower than those which are anticipated after prolonged power operation. While this required only minimal shielding, enough of the shielding was used for the operations with the control rod and PCV 522 to provide experience in setting up and in using the tools through the portable shielding. Although PCV 522 and its filter assembly was quite a large radioactive source, 100 r/hr at the outer surface of the filter, no significant personnel exposure was encountered. In general, the tools, techniques, and previously made preparations proved more than adequate. In some cases, it was necessary to fabricate special tools or revise existing ones, but these cases did not hold up progress to any great extent. Good cooperation between management, reactor operations, maintenance planning, health physics, and the craft forces contributed toward efficient and smoothly run operations.

Modifications to the test loop were completed. The venturi flowmeter was relocated upstream of the orifice flow restriction, and a new flow-straightening section was installed near the pump discharge. The new flow straightener was modified to provide additional weld attachment of the blades inside the pipe. The new arrangement of the system is shown.

The prototype pump is being prepared for a test with an 11-1/2-inch impeller. Measurements will be made with the radiation densitometer to determine the undissolved gas content of the circulating salt. Other tests will be made in the pump tank off-gas circuit in connection with the plugging incidents experienced at the MSRE.

Pump Rotary Element Modification. The spare rotary element for the fuel salt pump was modified to provide a positive seal against leakage of oil from the catch basin past the outside of the shield plug and into the pump tank. Previously, a solid copper O-ring compressed between the bearing housing and shield plug was used to provide the seal. Incidents have occurred wherein oil leaked past the O-ring. Cross-sectional views of the part of the pump which includes the modifications are shown in Fig. 2. 16. The larger section shows the relationships between the pump shaft, the shaft lower seal, bearing housing, catch basin, shield plug, and the pump tank. The exploded views indicate the nature of the modification. The rotary element is being assembled for cold shakedown, and after satisfactory operation will be prepared for MSRE use and stored.

Drive Motors: A new design was completed for the containment vessel for the drive motors of the MSRE salt pumps. It provides single containment for the electrical power penetrations, in contrast to the double containment provided in the original design. The resulting simplification should eliminate a serious fabrication problem previously experienced with weld-induced laminations in the vessel wall.

This pump was placed in operation circulating salt at 1200°F, but it experienced a seizure after 1 hr of operation. Examination revealed the seizure to be in the molten-salt-lubricated bearing. As was the case with the test previous to this one, two of the snap rings for the bearing sleeve gimbals support were lost, and the other two were only loosely retained. Whether the bearing seizure or loss of the snap rings occurred first is a moot question. The design of the gimbals support is being.

Efforts to correct this instrument's deficiencies have been unsuccessful. The excitation oscillator, which had proved so unstable, was modified considerably (using information supplied by the manufacturer) in an attempt to eliminate its excessive frequency drift. These modifications made no improvement in the stability of the oscillator. As the design and success of other intended modifications depended upon the most practical action to take.

The coolant-salt system flow transmitter that failed in service at the MopE21. 12,13 was refilled with silicone oil and tested with the seals at room temperature. Prior to refilling the transmitter body, a vacuum pump was connected to the instrument in such a manner that the pressure could be reduced on the process side of both seals and both sides of the silicone-filled body at the same time. Liquid traps were installed in the body evacuation lines to catch any oil that might be forced out of the transmitter body by the expansion of trapped gas during evacuation. When the pressure was reduced to 23 in. Hg vacuum (the lowest pressure attainable with the system at that time), oil was forced from the capillaries: 8. 2 ml from the low-pressure side of the transmitter, and 15. 8 ml from the high-pressure side. After it was refilled, the temperature sensitivity of the instrument was 1 in. (water column) change in indicated output for each degree Fahrenheit change in ambient temperature.

Performance of the ball-float-type transmitter installed on the MSRE coolant-salt pump continues to be satisfactory. The necessary actions have been completed to correct the previously reported errors in calibration. As these were calculated corrections, some additional future adjustment may be required.

The ball-float level transmitter on the MSRE pump test loop continues to operate satisfactorily, although on one fill, the float would not rise until the temperature of the heater on the bottom of the float chamber was increased. Either unmelted salt or curvature of the bottom inside the float chamber may now be assumed to be the cause of this sticking. A previous inspection of the core tube showed no deposits that would cause it to stick in the core chamber. This design error was noted prior to the fabrication of the float chamber for the MSRE and corrected on the assumption that this valving action might occur.

The level test loop completed four years of operation at temperature this month; it is still operating satisfactorily. The other was removed last year so the ultrasonic single-point level indicator could be installed; it was operating satisfactorily when removed.

Observation of the performance of 110 single-point temperature alarm switches installed at the MSRE has continued. As reported previously, the switch modules were reset prior to the power operation of the reactor. Data obtained from subsequent spot checks of module set points indicated.

That a few modules had shifted excessively; however, these data are considered to be inconclusive because records indicated that the modules may have been readjusted. Some additional cases of dual set points were discovered and corrected. Routine checks and observations of module performance will be continued until sufficient data are obtained to permit an accurate evaluation of the reliability of these devices.

Testing of alternate material combinations for helium control valve trim has been terminated. Close attention was given to alignment during reassembly of the valves, and all trim was given a light coat of machine oil before installation. All the repaired valves operated satisfactorily in shop tests. One additional helium control valve failure (also due to sticking) has occurred. Both valves are being disassembled and will be refitted with spare (17-4 PH to Stellite No. 6) trim. Because the failures may be due to evaporation of the lubricant, an attempt will be made to find a less volatile oil or grease to use for trim lubricant. Previous attempts to use graphite-based lubricants were not successful.

Coolant salt radiator differential temperature thermocouples. A final check on the effects of thermocouple and lead-wire material mismatch was made by heating their disconnects both individually and simultaneously to 150°F. No readable change in the output voltage was noted. A seven-point calibration was run on the thermocouple pair between 1040 and 1250°F, which resulted in a constant error with the outlet thermocouple reading 0. 220 mV high with respect to the inlet thermocouple. The resistance of the thermocouple loop was determined to be high enough to require recalibration of the receiving instrument to maintain required accuracy.

Thermocouple Drift Analysis: The examination of eight metal-sheathed, mineral-insulated Chromel-Alumel thermocouples, fabricated from MSRE material, for calibration drift at 1250°F has been completed. Throughout a 26-month testing period, all thermocouples exhibited a consistent level of drift.

Performance of the temperature scanning system developed for use: The switches would need frequent attention, and the mean life between routine cleaning or repair would be about 1000 hours. The switches have given very little trouble, and the mean life of the switches has been much greater than 1000 hours. Since the start of operation of this system in September 1964, there have been no bearing or other mechanical failures of the five switches installed. Four switches developed excessive noise during this period and required cleaning and replacement of the mercury. In one of these cases, the switch failure was caused by a failure in the nitrogen purge gas supply system. All five switches were cleaned and reconditioned before the start of power operations as a routine precautionary measure.

One routine function of the MSR data logger will be the periodic calculation of the separate reactivity effects associated with reactor operation above some baseline or zero-reactivity condition. For this purpose, one of the quantities the computer must calculate is the negative reactivity corresponding to each configuration of the shim and regulating rods. By using a least-squares curve-fitting procedure, we have obtained an analytical formula that closely approximates the integral curves determined from rod calibration experiments at zero power. The functional expression used for fitting the experimental curves was determined by applying a perturbation technique to the integral expression for the rod reactivity, as outlined below.

In this formula, the column vector of group fluxes corresponds to the condition with the rods inserted. 9 is the row vector of adjoint fluxes for the reference state. SA is the local perturbation in the neutron removal operator due to absorptions in the rods, and P is the neutron production operator.

When the parameters are introduced into (2), and the integrations are performed, the usual formula for the reactivity-worth curve for a partially inserted control rod is obtained. This result was tested by adjusting the parameters S259 and SN in order to fit the formula to the rod-worth curves obtained from experiments. While reasonably good agreement was obtained in fitting the curve for the single (regulating) rod, poorer results were obtained when combinations of insertions of shim and regulating rods were considered. The functional expression obtained from standard first-order perturbation theory was, therefore, judged inadequate for representing the rod-reactivity curves.

We have found that a significant improvement in the fit can be made by assuming that the axial distribution of thermal flux, Φ2, is perturbed according to the position of the shim-regulating rod bank (Φ1), but is unaffected by the position of the regulating rod (Φ2).

By introducing this approximation in Eq. 7 and redefining the constants, it was found that where Zg is the zero point insertion of the rods when withdrawn to their upper limit, relative to the extrapolated zero of the flux distribution, and X1,2 are the measured rod insertions.

The parameters characterizing the unperturbed flux distribution, Z0, and H, were obtained from earlier core physics studies. The results of the magnitude of the rod reactivity are plotted as a function of rod position for various configurations of shim and regulating rods. The ordinate scale in this figure is arbitrarily normalized to zero measured reactivity when the regulating rod is fully inserted, and the two shim rods are withdrawn to 51 inches. The rightmost curve represents the case when the three rods are moved in a banked position with the tips of the rods at equal elevations.

The solid curves are the reactivity magnitude calculated from the least-squares formula. The points shown as solid dots are sample points determined from the experimental rod calibration curves. Over most of the range of rod movement, the calculated and measured reactivity are in agreement within about 0.02% Sk/k. Near the extreme positions of the rods, the error is somewhat larger.

To supplement the experimental studies of the behavior of noble gas injected into the MSRE fuel, theoretical calculations were made to determine the influence of the spatial distribution of 135y absorbed within the graphite core. It is expected that the concentration of xenon in the salt will be relatively uniform throughout the volume of circulation. However, within the graphite pores, the 135y would tend to assume an overall spatial distribution governed by the burnout rate in the neutron flux. This distribution would be concave, with the minimum concentration occurring near the position of the maximum thermal flux and the maximum concentration near the boundaries of the reactor core.

It is intended that the reactivity due to \(^{135}\)Xe poisoning will be periodically calculated during operation by use of the TRW-340 data logger. From a practical standpoint, we are limited to the use of 4 relatively simple point kinetics models for on-line calculations. Therefore, any corrections for the spatial distribution of the \(^{135}\)Xe poisoning must be predetermined from theoretical studies with a more elaborate model of the reactor core.

The graphite volume associated with a single fuel channel is useful to compute this quantity before performing the integrations over the entire core graphite volume indicated in Eq. (16). Although nearly all the xenon in the graphite would be expected to be in the pores nearest the graphite-salt interface, this local averaging procedure can be used because the radial variation of neutron flux across a single graphite stringer is negligible.

We have used a one-dimensional model for the fuel channels in order to simplify the calculations. The fuel and graphite widths corresponding to a single channel were chosen so that the ratios of mass transfer surface area to volumes were equal to those of the actual channel.

At time t = 0, equilibrium conditions corresponding to the initial. For times following the change in power level, the differential equations were solved by means of Laplace transforms. A sufficient approximation to the exact solution was obtained by use of the condition.

Allowing equilibrium poisoning conditions to prevail before further increasing the power. The initial dip in the curve representing the 5 to 10-MW step is a consequence of the relative time lag between the increase in the burnout rate in the graphite and the increase in the production rate of +3°Xe in the salt. Figure 3.3 gives the analogous results for power levels descending from 10 MW.

Further studies will be made with this theoretical model in order to determine the sensitivity of the calculated corrections to the effective mass transfer coefficient and stripping rate, and to determine the best method of introducing this correction into the on-line calculation of the 17°Xxe reactivity.

A test program is in progress to study the compatibility of structural materials with fuels and coolants of interest to the Molten-Salt Reactor Program. Thermal convection loops described previously are used as the standard test in this program.

Circulation of lead in a Ch-1% Zr alloy thermal convection loop hot leg, shown in Fig. 1, revealed no evidence of attack; however, a small quantity of dendritic crystals was observed in the cold leg. Electron probe analysis indicated these crystals to be columbium.

Transfer of primary elements: The loops will operate with a hot-leg temperature of 1100°F and a 200° ΔT. Magnesium was added to act as a deoxidizer and an inhibitor. An original plan to include titanium in the lead was deferred because of difficulty in making a Ti-Pb alloy.

Two loops containing molten fluorides continued to operate without incident. A type 304 stainless steel loop with removable specimens has operated for 22,000 hours, and a Hastelloy N loop containing specimens of Hastelloy N modified with 2% Cb has operated for 33,000 hours.

Specimens of Hastelloy N and grade CGB graphite were exposed for approximately 1100 hours to molten fluoride salts in the core of the MSRE during the precritical operation and the initial critical and associated zero-power experiments. The purposes for these were: (1) to monitor materials during these preliminary operations and (2) to be the mass equivalent for the similar specimens that replace them for surveillance of the power experiments. These specimens showed no changes as a result of exposure during these first, mild experiments.

Rods. They were machined from MSRE graphite, grade CGB, having a relatively high concentration of cracks, with the idea that this would magnify adverse changes that might occur in the relatively short, mild exposure. There was essentially no salt on the graphite, and the machining marks appeared unaltered. As in the laboratory tests, radiographs showed that surface-connected cracks tended to be filled with salt, with no salt penetrating into the graphite. The volume of salt in the graphite averaged 0. 06% of the bulk volume of the graphite, which is approximately one-tenth of the maximum permitted in the MSRE design specifications.

The Hastelloy N specimens, in the form of tensile specimen rods, also drained free of salt. They had lost their bright, shiny, machined surface and had a bright, gray-white matte surface similar to that obtained in hydrogen firing of the metal.

Two of the specimens were sectioned and examined metallographically. For comparative purposes, two control specimens of the same composition were also examined. Longitudinal and transverse sections of the shoulder and gauge-length regions of the tensile specimens were examined.

Tested specimens were darkened. It appears that the boundaries were perhaps either depleted or enriched in some unknown constituent. A section of a tested surveillance specimen has been submitted for analysis with the electron microprobe analyzer; however, the analysis has not been.

A longitudinal view of the control specimen is shown in Fig. 0. 5. During exposure in the reactor at approximately 1200°F, the alloy recrystallized to the smaller grain size shown in Fig. 0. 3.

In the latter part of December 1960, salts, and it has been operating satisfactorily. This unit contains three sets of graphite and Hastelloy-N specimens that match the sets of reactor core specimens in the MSRE. The function of this unit is to subject its specimens to approximately the temperature profile and the major temperature and pressure fluctuations of the reactor. These unirradiated specimens will be used to obtain baseline data for those that are irradiated in the reactor.

When the MSRE is operating, the atmosphere in the reactor cell and the drain tank cell will be nitrogen containing about 3% oxygen. There has been some concern that the nitrogen, when ionized by radiation, will nitride and embrittle the Hastelloy N of the reactor components. Since the capsules in Experiment ORNL MTR-47-6 were cooled with air and with air and nitrogen mixtures during irradiation, we examined the bottoms of capsules 1 and 2 for evidence of nitriding of Hastelloy under irradiation.

The capsules were contained in a copper heater block so that only the tops and bottoms were exposed to nitrogen. Construction of the capsules and the operating conditions during irradiation have been reported. Unfortunately, the outer surfaces of the bottoms were damaged during the initial disassembly of the capsules at the MIR hot cells. Machined grooves on the capsule bottoms were still visible, and the bottoms of the grooves, which were also exposed to nitrogen, were undamaged. Longitudinal sections of the bottoms from capsules 1 and 2 were examined metallographically. A thin oxide layer was present on the exposed surface, as shown in Fig. 6; however, we saw no evidence of nitriding on either of the specimens we examined.

A longitudinal section of each capsule body, at the vapor-liquid interface, was examined metallographically. Two unirradiated control capsules and a section from an as-fabricated capsule were also examined. One of the control capsules had been tested out-of-pile under conditions similar to those for the irradiated capsules, and the other capsule was a spare for the irradiation capsules.

The interior surfaces of all four irradiated capsules were smooth, and we saw no evidence of scale or film formation. The effect was spotty in all four capsules, and the depth to which grain boundary darkening occurred was greater in the vapor phase. Darkening occurred to a depth of approximately 5 mils in capsules 2 and 3, and slightly less in capsules 1 and 4.

We cannot explain what caused the grain-boundary effect because of their high activity level. The specimens cannot be analyzed with the electron microprobe.

It is highly desirable to join graphite pipes in the reactor core to Hastelloy N headers. The basic obstacle encountered in attempting such a joint is the very large difference between the thermal expansion coefficients of the graphite and the metal. Due to this difference, a joint of graphite directly brazed to Hastelloy N cracks upon cooling from the brazing temperature. This reduces the stress gradients. Thus, this program is concerned with the development of transition pieces, as well as acceptable brazing.

Molybdenum and tungsten are two metals that have expansion coefficients intermediate between those of graphite and Hastelloy N and were selected for further study. However, due to cost and availability considerations, nearly all work was performed on molybdenum. This decision was further justified by the fact that nearly all alloys which braze molybdenum will also braze tungsten.

Studies are being conducted using the newly designed transition joint presented in Fig. 9. The design incorporates an 11° tapered edge to reduce shear stresses arising from the thermal expansion differences. This technique may enable the joint between the molybdenum transition piece and the Hastelloy N to be made directly, that is, without another transition. Several assemblies are being prepared for evaluation of brazability and effects of thermal cycling.

The ORNL-developed brazing alloy, 35 Au-35 Ni-30 Mo (wt%), is very useful for brazing graphite. However, transmutation of the gold may limit its application in a high neutron flux. Consequently, a study was undertaken to develop a gold-free brazing alloy that is compatible with molten salts, contains a carbide former, and has a reasonably low melting point.

A first test was conducted in which a small pipe of grade CGB graphite, brazed to molybdenum, contained molten fluoride salts at 700°C. This test operated satisfactorily despite a primitive joint design and a relatively thin-walled graphite pipe, suggesting that larger graphite-metal joints may be feasible for molten-salt breeder reactors. Current MSBR designs have a maximum pressure difference of 30 psi across pipe walls, which is less than one-fifth the maximum pressure used in this test.

Of MSRE graphite with its axis parallel to the extrusion direction of the bar. Pure molybdenum caps were brazed to the ends of the pipe by the Welding and Brazing Group of the Metals and Ceramics Division with 35Au-35Ni-30Mo (ANM-16) (in wt%) braze, which is one of their earlier developments in brazing alloys.

The appearance of the outside of the pipe was essentially unaltered by the test. These photographs also show the good wetting of the brazes to the metal and graphite. A small circumferential separation of the braze and the graphite can be seen at the bottom joint next to the graphite. Microscopic examination indicated that the effective bonding and sealing was in the crevice between the pieces.

The 50 Au-50 Ni (wt%) braze used to join the molybdenum to the Inconel salt-supply tube bonded strongly to the Inconel. In the direction transverse to the rolling direction of the molybdenum, a few molybdenum grains were pulled out at the molybdenum-braze interface. This was not apparent in the as-brazed material and will be studied more thoroughly as the work progresses.

Procurement and studies of grades of graphite potentially promising for a molten-salt breeder reactor are in the initial stages. Attempts are being made to obtain graphite suitable for irradiation studies in order to secure the required irradiation exposures (103 nvt, E > 0. 18 MeV) reasonably soon. Samples of needle-coke graphite and isotropic graphite are being tested. Isotropic.

The prime requirements of the graphite for the initial procurement are that it have pores small enough to prevent the entry of molten salts and that it have a low gas permeability. The pore entrance diameters, with the higher values being favored.

To date, we have obtained graphite samples from the Carbon Products Division of the Union Carbide Corporation, Great Lakes Carbon Corporation, Poco Graphite, Inc. , Speer Carbon Company, Stackpole Carbon Company, and the Y-12 Chemical Engineering Group of the Development Division.

Potentially useful for an MSBR, we are routinely examining them for the entrance diameter spectrum of the accessible pores; permeability to helium gas; permeation by molten fluoride salts; microstructure; specific resistance; flexural strength; and coefficients of thermal expansion. The current samples are in this stage of examination. Those that appear to have promise will be given additional tests for purity and crystallographic development and will be included in the irradiation studies and graphite-metal joint development mentioned previously.

Recent progress in the development of graphite for reactor use may be applied directly in estimating properties of a graphite designed for the MSBR. There are, of course, several unknowns which limit the ability to state categorically that any graphite will withstand the MSBR environment. The major limitation is the lack of evidence to demonstrate that any graphite can sustain massive doses of 10^7 nvt or greater and still retain its integrity. The tubular thin-wall design in the MSBR is one of the better configurations for reducing the differential-growth problem to within the capabilities of the graphite. The tubular shape is also easy to fabricate and to test reliably and nondestructively in order to ensure maximum integrity.

The properties of the most promising grade of graphite can be projected from available grades with a fair degree of certainty. These estimations are based primarily on properties obtained from isotropic grades with densities required for the MSBR grade.

The magnitude of the stress generated by differential growth can be fairly well approximated. The main uncertainty is in the flux gradient across the tube wall. Using the conservative estimation of 2. 4 x 10^774 in.

Failure, however, could result from the inability of the graphite to absorb creep deformation even though the stress level is much less (6 x 10^7 nvt). The strain to be absorbed would be about 1. 8%, 3.6%, and 7.2%, respectively. This corresponds to 5-, 10-, and 20-year lifetimes with a dose rate of 9 x 10^4 nvt, the maximum fast flux in the present design of the MSBR. The consideration of a strain limit for failure is realistic; however, the strain limit for fracture has not been established. It has been demonstrated that graphite can absorb strains in excess of 2% in 10^7 nvt without loss of mechanical integrity. There is also some evidence that the growth rate will diminish after a 10^7 nvt dose. Thus, the graphite might not be forced to absorb the total quantity of strain calculated. Therefore, it appears that failure by reaching a strain limit will require at least five years of service.

The main uncertainty, as mentioned earlier, is simply the ability of the graphite to sustain the massive dose without loss of integrity. There is no experimental evidence beyond 2 x 10^7 nvt on which to extrapolate the irradiation damage of graphite, so extrapolation of data to 10^37 would be pure conjecture. The first factor is the recognition that in the 700°C temperature range, the dimensional changes for the first 10^2 nvt do nothing more than repair the damage caused by cooling of the graphite from its graphitization temperature. The additional dimensional changes of the crystals after 10 nvt produce stress in the graphite in the opposite direction from that produced by the thermal cooling. In effect, the stress produced on the basal planes will be compressive instead of tensile. This, of course, is very much preferred in that the crystal can sustain this type of loading more readily without cracking. This internal deformation was so great that irregularities were evident on the surface.

The objective of this program is twofold: to determine the behavior of the MSRE structural materials under neutron irradiation and to investigate various ways of improving the resistance to radiation damage by making small changes in chemistry or by specified mechanical treatments. Hastelloy N is a complicated alloy, and we do not have enough data for a statistical analysis, so some of our present interpretations may seem contradictory. Our findings are summarized below.

The dependence of the creep-rupture life of Hastelloy N at 650°C on the integrated neutron flux is shown by the data in Fig. 13. These data are for an air-melted heat (5065) which was irradiated cold. The quantity f is the ratio of the rupture life of the irradiated material to that of the unirradiated material. There seems to be a general trend for the rate of reduction in rupture life with flux to decrease as the stress level is decreased. Three slopes are indicated, which are used in subsequent calculations.

The results of the post-irradiation creep tests of cold-irradiated specimens were used to predict the creep behavior of the alloy under simultaneous stress and irradiation. The basic assumption made in this treatment is that the creep-rupture curve is not altered by irradiation except that the rupture life is reduced. Hence, one gives up a specific fraction of life for an increment of flux. The lines drawn in figure 14 have equations of the form.

The procedure just described was used to calculate the lines shown in 0. 14. The constants obtained from the lower slope appear to more closely predict the actual test data. Points are shown on 0. 14 for two in-pile creep experiments. The agreement is reasonably good at stresses above about 20,000 psi, but there is a distinct tailing off at lower stresses. This observation is important in that it indicates a longer rupture life for structural materials at the low stresses in the MSRE than was previously predicted on the basis of a linear extrapolation.

The results of in-pile creep tests and post-irradiation creep for heat 5085 (0. 15) seem to show that the rupture life in post-irradiation tests is considerably longer than the life in in-pile tests. The effect increases with decreasing stress. Data for two specimens at 32,350 psi indicate that holding for several hundred hours at 650°C and low stress after irradiation result in a longer rupture life at high stress. The data from test ORR 138 of specimens from heat 5065, shown in 0. 16, follow the same pattern.

The specimens for the postirradiation tests in ORR 138 and 140 were held at 650°C for about 1200 hours under little or no stress during the irradiation before testing. The in-pile test specimens were heated only during the test. It seems possible that the difference in thermal history.

Might account for at least part of the difference in rupture life. This suggestion is partly supported by results of other post-irradiation creep tests that are included in. Except at 40,000 psi stress, the rupture lives of specimens irradiated cold are generally less than those of specimens irradiated hot.

In both creep-rupture and tensile tests, the properties of vacuum-melted heats have shown a significant dependence on the irradiation temperature, whereas air-melted heats were less sensitive to irradiation. Air was melted, and its creep properties show no consistent dependence on the irradiation temperature. Heats 2477 and 7304 were both vacuum melted, and the rupture life and ductility were much worse when the material was irradiated at 650°C than when irradiated at 150°C. This effect is.

The effect of pretest heat treatment on the tensile properties is shown in Table 4. 4 for two heats of Hastelloy N. The range of heat treatments used on heat 5065 had no detectable effect on the ductility. It is apparent that the ductility improved as the annealing temperature was increased. The grain size increased considerably, and this would be expected to increase the irradiation effect. However, some other effect, possibly the removal of boron from the grain boundaries by the high-temperature anneal, seems to have been more important.

The weld studies on Hastelloy N have two general objectives: (1) to improve the weldability so that welds have greater strength and ductility, and (2) to study the effects of irradiation on the properties of welds and investigate ways of improving their resistance to irradiation damage. It was reported previously that welds involving standard air-melted heats of Hastelloy N exhibited lower rupture life and ductility at 650°C, as compared with the base metals. However, the properties could microprobe studies have since shown that significant silicon segregation occurs in the weld metal. These observations have led to the proposal.

The silicon may be responsible for the poor weldability of Hastelloy N, and studies have been directed toward establishing this point more firmly. Irradiation damage studies have involved determining how irradiation changes the tensile properties. Based on the premise that a large grain size in the weld metal may cause degradation of the properties under irradiation, attempts have been made to reduce the grain size by adding grain-refining impurities to the filler metal. The work in both of these areas is presented briefly.

A second group of experimental welds was made in an effort to refine the weld-metal grain size and/or provide innocuous precipitates upon which the helium (from the n,@ reaction) molecules can assimilate. Experimentally, this has been done by spray coating an air-melted Hastelloy N filler metal (heat 5055) with Al2O3. The weld made from this filler, made with unsprayed, air-melted filler metal from heat 5101, weld No. 6.

The creep-rupture properties of welds 4, 6, and 7 are compared in line 17 with those of the base metal and weld No. 1 (a duplicate of weld slightly weaker, and weld No. 7 was slightly stronger). The rupture elongations at a stress of 40,000 psi were 3%, 6%, and 3% for weld Nos. 4, 6, and 7 respectively. All failures were observed to occur in either the weld metal or at the fusion line. Metallographic studies are in progress to determine the exact location of the failures.

Several of the specimens were heat-treated after welding for 5 hours at 871°C. As shown in Fig. 17, this treatment produced a significant improvement in the creep strength; the ductility was also improved. A comparison is made in Table 4. 7 of the degree of improvement caused in the different welds by postweld heat treating. The heat treatment made the rupture lives of the welds more nearly the same and equal to or better.

Since only a few of the irradiated specimens from welds 4, 6, and 7 have been tested, it is necessary to speak in generalities concerning the properties of these welds after irradiation. Specimens of all three welds were irradiated in the ORR at 43°C to a thermal neutron dose of 8. 5 x 10^20 nvt. Figure 4. 18 compares the tensile elongation of the base metal and weld No. 4 specimen before and after irradiation. In general, the base metal is affected the most. The welds initially have lower ductility, but the ductility is not reduced much by irradiation. At a test temperature of 871°C, the weld and the base metal have the same ductility. At the unirradiated ductility, it was found that the ductilities of the as-welded and post-weld heat-treated materials were comparable after irradiation. All the irradiated specimens failed in the weld metal. These same welds will be evaluated further through post-irradiation creep testing.

It is important in molten-salt reactor operations to be able to ascertain quickly and accurately that the uranium concentration in the molten fuel solution conforms to design specifications and that the chemical purity of the salt is maintained.

Significant advances in analytical methods have been incorporated into routine practice since the zero-power experiment was completed in July 1965. The increased accuracy, which is apparent in chemical analyses, shows more clearly than ever that composition and purity of the reactor salts can be ascertained accurately and economically on a routine basis, and that current methods now afford excellent monitoring practices.

Application of three innovations to the analysis of MSRE salts has been made within the current report period: a new endpoint for uranium titrations, a new method for structural-metal ions, and a new method for oxide analyses. Together, they have provided increased assurance that the composition of the fuel conforms to the inventory values and reactivity balances and that the chemical purity of the salt is even greater than could be affirmed from previous results.

Uranium Assay. Controlled-potential coulometry is used as the primary method for the determination of uranium in MSR fuel because of the high order of precision inherent in the method. From 50 to 100 μg of uranium can be titrated with a precision of the order of less.

Evidence was noted during the pre-critical and zero-power experiments that a distinct bias between nominal and analytical values for uranium existed, and that the analytical values for uranium were approximately 1% lower than nominal. We inferred this phenomenon to be a consequence of dilution of the fuel salt by flush salt; although the amount of dilution required to rationalize the bias was of the order of 140 lb, somewhat higher than was compatible with the weigh-cell data.

A recent refinement in the method of determining the uranium endpoint in the controlled-potential coulometric analysis has been made. The endpoint had previously been estimated as that point at which the electrode current is reduced to 5 μA. The endpoint values are now computed by extrapolation of the reduction-potential curves to zero from a 50-μA cutoff point. In recent control analyses in which synthetic standards were used, the 5-μA endpoint was demonstrated to have a negative bias of 0.8%, whereas the bias for the 50-μA extrapolation endpoint was zero.

The circulated and static fuel salts in the MSRE became compositionally homogeneous for the first time after completion of the zero-power experiment. The 5U enrichment fraction of the salt circulating at zero power was found experimentally to be 33. 71 wt%, as compared with the book value of 33.5 wt%. After circulation, the salt was drained into the storage tanks, blending there with other fuel of lower 775URF concentration. No significant burnup has, as yet, occurred in the fuel. We have had, therefore, an opportunity at the beginning of the full-power experiment to establish an analytical baseline of enrichment. The experimental results show that the fuel now contains 35U at 33.241 wt%, in good agreement with a calculated value of 33. 2 wt%.

Structural-Metal Impurities. We have inferred that nickel is present in the MSRE fuel salt only as a metallic phase and that iron is also present predominantly, if not entirely, in metallic form. In an attempt to gain evidence to support this inference, samples of the static fuel salt were obtained from the fuel storage tanks during the two-week period following the zero-power experiment. The fact that the concentrations of the structural-metal impurities were not found to change during this storage period led us to conclude that thermal convection in the storage tank was adequate to prevent settling of fine metallic particles of iron and nickel in the drain tank.

In recent experiments, a sample of the MSRE fuel was removed from the pump bowl before significant power was generated by the reactor. This sample was analyzed by a newly developed method using controlled-potential voltammetry. The salt was found to contain approximately 8 to 10 ppm of iron in the divalent state. The concentration of nickelous ion was found to be lower than is detectable by this method, that is, less than 1 ppm. The net concentrations of iron and nickel in the salt specimens were 131 and 40 ppm, respectively. The salt also contains 48 ppm of chromium in ionic form. These results are particularly useful in that they indicate that the total concentration of ionic structural-metal contaminants in the fuel is not greater than.

Oxide Analysis. The most serious of the adverse consequences of chemical impurities in MSRE are those which would arise from contamination by oxides. Of great significance is that the oxide content of the MSRE salts can now be determined routinely and accurately at concentrations lower than 100 ppm by purging samples of the molten salt with H2 and HF. Oxide concentration is then calculated from the amount of water recovered from the effluent gas stream. This hydrofluorination method, for determining the concentration of oxides in molten fluorides, was applied to the analysis of the MSRE flush, fuel, and coolant salts for the first time at the beginning of the full-power experiment. At that point, the radioactivity of the salts was negligibly low, and analyses could be performed in the development laboratory. As activity was generated in the fuel salt, it became imperative that subsequent chemical.

The results of the analyses performed to date in the development laboratory reveal that the oxide concentration in the MSR flush, fuel, and coolant salts is 75, 95, and 40 ppm, respectively. Based on the results obtained by Baes and co-workers, saturation of the fuel by oxide is considered to occur at approximately 500 ppm at the reactor operating temperature of 1200°F. The current analytical data indicate, therefore, that the MSRKE salts, which have remained in the molten state for some tem months, have been well-protected from moisture contamination during this period.

Salt Composition Analyses. The sampling schedule, which was followed at the beginning of the MSRE full-power experiment, afforded the first opportunity to obtain statistically meaningful analytical data. The results of all chemical analyses of the MSRE salts, which have been performed in connection with the full-power experiments, are given in Table 5. 1. The composition of the fuel salt, as indicated by these data, is compared in Table 5. 2 with the results of previous analyses. It is apparent from these data that, but for the still unexplained minor bias between nominal and analytical values for lithium and beryllium, the agreement between inventory records and analytical results is excellent.

The program for bringing the MSRE to full-power operation has been interrupted on two recent occasions by flow restrictions in the off-gas system. Symptoms of plugging became pronounced in each case after about 12 hours of operation at 1 MW. Small specimens of the materials which were suspected to have caused plugging were removed from the affected parts of the off-gas system and subjected to various tests in an attempt to determine the reasons for flow restrictions. It was assumed that chemical identification would indicate the cause of the.

Restrictions were first noted in the capillary restrictor in line 521; at the same time, the 533 check valve became inoperative. Restriction was also noted in the sintered stainless steel line filter and 522 valve assemblage. The filter element, which was removed, was capable of blocking the passage of more than 90% of the particulate matter of 0. 7 µ in diameter. It was replaced by a filter designed to block particulates of >50 µ in diameter. On resuming operation at 1 MW, restrictions appeared to develop in three locations: at valve 522B, at the entries to charcoal beds 1A and 1B, and in the lines ahead of the auxiliary charcoal bed. Currently, a specimen has been obtained only from valve 621, which controls flow into charcoal bed 1B. Examinations and tests are still being performed.

On the basis of the results shown in Table 5. 3, we would conclude tentatively that the restrictions in the off-gas line may be attributed to varnish-like organic material. Gulfspin-35 is used as the lubricating oil for the rotary element. It is composed primarily of a mixture of long-chain aliphatic linear and branched hydrocarbons. Recent measurements show that its refractive index is 1. 473. The refractive index of the heaviest 10% volume fraction obtained on vacuum distillation of the oil was found to be approximately 1. 50. This inference appears to be strengthened further by the observation that the varnish-like materials appeared to have limited or no solubility at room temperature in xylene, petroleum ether, carbon tetrachloride.

X-ray diffraction studies of uranium-bearing salts from solidified MSRE fuel and concentrate have yielded information of chemical interest. A complete crystal structure analysis of 7LiF6UF has shown this tetragonal substance actually to be LiUs and to have a basically different structure from the rhombohedral compounds which do have the 7:6 ratio. Compounds of the latter stoichiometry do not appear in the present fuel mixtures.

In LiUF6, each uranium ion is coordinated by nine fluoride ions in the shape of a trigonal prism, with each rectangular face bearing a pyramid. This polyhedron is similar to those in UGF6 but different from those of 8-coordinated U in UF8. It is not presently known whether this difference is significant or just a coincidence of the packing of F7 ions.

Apparatus was constructed to obtain vapor pressures by the carrier-gas method in order to determine (1) vapor composition in the Li-BeF system (to complement the manometric pressure data already obtained for this system) and (2) rare-earth vapor concentrations in equilibrium with liquid mixtures of importance to the molten-salt reactor distillation process (from these concentrations, more accurate decontamination factors for the rare-earth fission products will be obtained).

Three compositions of the LiF-BeF2 system have thus far been investigated. The vapor-pressure data are summarized in Table 5. 4, based on the assumption that the vapor consists only of monomeric LiF and Be2. It should be noted that the apparent partial pressure of LiF increases with decreasing concentration of LiF in the melt.

Density. Several years ago, after the published data on the density of molten fluoride had been examined, it was proposed that the simple rule of additivity of molar volumes might be very useful for estimating densities of fluoride melts. Since that time, the results of all additional experimental investigations have been studied. The rule of additivity of molar volumes appeared to hold quite well except for one system; this was the NaF-UF6 system where positive deviations as great as 6% were observed.

Bridgman's theory of energy transport in liquids has been developed. The derivation of the method is given in reference 10. The expression is where k is the thermal conductivity, V is the molar volume, and u is the velocity of sound in the melt. All three variables should be in cgs units. To use Eq. (4), the molar volume and velocity of sound are necessary. Molar volume is easily estimated by the rule of additivity as outlined above.

The expansivity is the negative of the temperature coefficient of density divided by the density. Estimates were obtained for the dissolved-oxide concentration at Bed saturation of 2Li-BeF2 (approximately the composition of MSRE flush salt). For 2LiP-BeF2 melts containing more than 0. 1 mole/kg of Zr, wherein ZrO. 9 becomes the least-soluble oxide, reactions (6) and (8) were combined in a similar way to obtain estimates of the concentration of dissolved oxide at ZrO2 saturation.

However, these estimates were of limited accuracy owing to difficulties in the determination of Q9 by the transpiration method. In particular, this quotient was found to be too large to be measured with useful accuracy in the MSRE fuel composition; hence, it was necessary to estimate the oxide tolerance of the fuel by extrapolation from results for fuel salt diluted by flush salt.

During the past year, a more direct method for determining these oxide solubilities has been adopted. A measured volume of salt, which previously had been saturated by equilibration with excess solid ZrO2 or BeO, was passed upward through a sintered nickel filter into a heated reaction vessel. There it was sparged with an H2-H2 mixture to remove the dissolved oxide as H2O. The effluent H2O-H2 mixture was passed through a sodium fluoride column maintained at 90°C to remove the unreacted H2O, and then it was passed through a Karl Fischer titration assembly where the water content was determined.

Typically, 125 g samples of salt were filtered into the upper vessel and sparged with a gas flow of 150 cm/min at a temperature to remove essentially all of the oxide increased as the ZrF2 content of the mixtures was increased, but generally did not exceed 4 hr. The blank was usually equivalent to less than 0. 002 mole per kg of oxide in.

The results obtained by this method for simulated flush-salt—fuel salt mixtures (0. 3) are in reasonable agreement with previous solubility product. QyrOo with ZrP concentration (the dashed lines remained constant). The temperature dependence of the oxide tolerance is indicated in 0.4 for three compositions: (1) the flush salt, (2) the approximate composition of minimum oxide tolerance, and (3) the fuel salt.

The solubility results obtained thus far for BeO in 2L4AF-BeP (Fig. 4) are somewhat above the previous values obtained by combination of 14; but these new results showed considerable scatter. This is thought to be caused by the presence of finely divided BeO, which was not filtered completely from all the samples. These measurements are being repeated with the use of longer equilibrium times in the hope that this will improve the filterability of the BeO. The oxide tolerance represents our best estimate at present.

Vacuum distillation separation of molten-salt fuel or fuel components from the rare-earth fission products is an attractive method of decreasing neutron losses by capture. To design process equipment for this task, both the mass rate of distillation and the relative volatility of the rare earths must be known for the particular salt system used. Completed experiments concern the process demonstration planned on MSRE fuel, but are directly applicable to any proposed thermal MSBR fuel.

For MSR fuel, removal of the uranium by fluorination is proposed. The fuel solvent and remaining fission products would then be fed at the distillation rate to a vacuum still charged with LiF-BeF2-4RF; at that composition which will yield the fuel solvent as the distilled product, the rare-earth fission products would concentrate in the still. The residue would be discarded or processed when necessitated by heat from the fission products or concentration of rare earths in the product.

A 10-mL graphite cylinder, containing ~17 g of salt with a free surface (when molten) of 1 cm, was used for the still pot. This cylinder fitted into a U-shaped Hastelloy N tube heated electrically to a given temperature as measured by four thermocouples in the graphite cylinder. When the desired temperature was reached, distillation was initiated by evacuating the assembly. The product salt condensed in a cooler (~459°C) collecting cup in the opposite leg. Each repetition brought the BeFp and ZrF2 concentrations in the pot closer.

To those who would yield fuel solvent (LiF-ReF2-ZrF4, 65-30-5 mole %) as a product. After the equilibrium concentration was approached, 2200 ppm of neodymium (as Na) was added to the still bottom, and several distillate samples were taken. Then the neodymium concentration was raised to 22,000 ppm, and the sequence was repeated. For both TAF and the nominal equilibrium composition, the effect of temperature on mass rate was determined.

The data show the effect of temperature and mass rate. Single experiments show considerable scatter, so inclusive bands are shown. The slope of the bands is consistent with the heat of vaporization of the components and strongly suggests that ebullition does not occur. Solvent surface heat flux is <1/100 of the available heat to the graphite cylinder; it is doubtful that the distillation is heat-limited.

The equilibrium composition in the still pot undoubtedly changes with temperature due to the change in activity coefficients of the components. The composition found at nominal equilibrium after several solvent additions of 5 to 7% by weight and after distillations at 1030°C neodymium as fluoride.

Evaporation into a vacuum from a quiescent molten-salt mixture of low vapor pressure should not permit vapor-liquid equilibrium at the surface of the melt. Transport from the surface should be controlled by the evaporation rates of the individual components. The amount vaporized is a function of the equilibrium vapor pressure, molecular.

Although internal consistency exists, the values are dependent on vapor pressure data for the pure components. 8. The least precise measurements are from MSRF-solvent distillations; these are included to substantiate the surmise that when ZrF2 is included in the melt, it effectively removes LiF from the solvent. The 1000°C LiF-BePs line has been extended to 100 mole % LiF since the initial LiF-BeP2-ZrF2 experiment contained <0. 35 mole % ZrF2, a quantity so small that the system can be assumed to be LiF-BeF2.

Causing an indeterminate (for the present) error. Both surface-temperature effects and the pure LiF–LiF₂ system are being studied. It is interesting to note that the assumption of unit activity coefficient for LiF does not lead to incompatibility with the data of others.

Studies of the removal of rare earths from a molten-fluoride solvent and their dissolution in molten metals have been oriented toward the development of a liquid-liquid extraction process for removing rare-earth fission products from molten-salt reactor fuels. Fluoride mixtures obtained by dissolving a selected rare earth into LiF-BeF2 (66-34 mole %) have been used to simulate the fuel solvent of the reference-design MSBR. In fuel reprocessing schemes proposed for the reactor, uranium will be removed prior to the removal of non-volatile fission products. When this simulated fuel mixture is contacted with a molten bismuth-lithium mixture, rare earths are reduced to their elemental valence states and are dissolved in the molten-metal phase. Experimental studies conducted thus far have examined the distribution of rare earths between the two liquid phases as functions of the lithium concentration in the metal phase. Subsequent experiments will elaborate on these findings and will examine the back extraction of rare earths from the liquid metal into a second salt mixture.

Fluoride starting materials were prepared in nickel equipment by adding sufficient rare-earth fluoride to approximately 2 kg of the solvent, LLF-BeF2 (66-34 mole %), to attain a rare-earth concentration. The mixture was treated with an HF-H2 mixture at 600°C to remove oxide impurities and at 700°C with H2 alone to reduce concentrations of structural-metal difluorides in the fluoride melt. The bismuth was purified by sparging the 2. The bismuth purification was carried out in the experimental extraction vessel of type 3041, stainless steel lined with low-carbon steel. Following the materials preparation phase of the experiment, the fluoride mixture was transferred as a liquid to the extraction vessel. Lithium metal was added directly to the metal phase without prior contact with the salt phase. Lithium, for incremental additions to the experiment, was freshly cut and weighed under mineral oil, affixed to a small-diameter steel rod, rinsed in benzene, and dried in the flowing inert atmosphere of the loading port prior to its addition.

Insertion and dissolution in the molten bismuth. Filtered samples of each phase were taken under assumed equilibrium conditions (approximately 2-hour periods) after each addition of lithium. Radiochemical analyses of each phase for rare-earth gamma activity and spectrographic analyses of the metal phase for rare-earth and lithium concentrations provided data for calculating the distribution of the rare earth in the system and its dependence on the lithium concentration of the metal.

A summary of these results illustrated in Fig. 7 shows that removing essentially all cerium, lanthanum, and neodymium and substantial quantities of samarium and curium from the barren fuel solvent. In all of the experiments, rare earths that were reduced from solution in the salt phase were found as dissolved components of the metal phase.

Each incremental addition of lithium to the system resulted in a near-linear increase in the concentration of lithium found in the metal phase. However, this dissolved quantity accounted for only 25 to 50% of the amount added to the system. The results of a blank extraction experiment in which rare earths were omitted from the system could not be distinguished from those obtained when rare earths were present.

In earlier experiments, beryllium metal was successfully used in place of lithium metal for the reduction of rare earths. Spectrographic analyses of the metal phase also showed that the lithium concentration in bismuth increased as the extraction of rare earths proceeded. These results implied that the reaction. If unit activities prevail for all metal species in the salt phase and for all ionic species in the metal phase; then the activity of Lithium dissolved in the metal phase can be expressed as a function of other activities in the system.

Although the apparent fractional exponents for the reduction reactions are as yet unexplained, the results are in rough agreement with the occurrence of lanthanum, cerium, and neodymium as trivalent ions in the salt mixture. Samarium and europium are probably reduced to their divalent states prior to their extraction into the metal phase.

Removal of Protactinium from Molten Fluorides by Oxide Precipitation. Since a single-region molten-salt breeder reactor would incorporate the fertile material in the reactor fuel mixture, chemical reprocessing schemes for recovering U-73 could be made more effective if Pa-33, its precursor, could be removed without alteration of the relatively large uranium concentration in the fuel mixture. The precipitation of an oxide of protactinium by the deliberate addition of oxide ion may provide the basis for such a reprocessing method if the simultaneous precipitation of UO2 can be avoided. Previous studies have demonstrated the chemical feasibility of oxide precipitation for removing protactinium from a fluoride mixture, LiF-BeF2-ThF2 (67-18-15 mole %), proposed as the blanket of a two-region molten-salt breeder.

In the fluoride fuel mixture of the MSRE, sufficient ZrF2 has been added to accommodate gross oxide contamination without loss of uranium from solution as UO2. Earlier studies had demonstrated that UO3 would not precipitate at 700°C from the solvent, LiF-BeF2 (66-34 mole %), with added UF6 and ZrF4 until the concentration ratio of ZrF4 to UF6 dropped below about 1. 5. Therefore, a preliminary study was made of the precipitation of PaO2 from a fluoride mixture known to have ZrO2 as the stable oxide phase.

The deliberate introduction of solid-phase oxide to the melt was made by adding ZrO₂ in small increments. Filtered samples of the salt mixture were taken at assumed equilibrium conditions after each oxide addition and were analyzed for ³Pa by gamma spectrometry. The results of these analyses showed that approximately 80% of the ⁴Pa activity was removed after the addition of about 67. 5 g of ZrO₂ (equivalent to 0. 125 mole per kilogram of salt) to the mixture.

If protactinium either formed a labile solid solution with ZrO2 or was removed from solution on the salt mixture by surface adsorption on ZrO2, then its distribution coefficient should have remained constant. The fraction of protactinium remaining in the liquid phase could then be expressed as a linear function of added ZrO2 by the equation.

The effective recovery of Pa-73 from a molten-salt breeder reactor will provide more economic production of fissionable U-34 by substantially reducing blanket inventory and equipment costs and by improving neutron utilization. Accordingly, chemical development efforts supporting the reference-design MSBR are concerned with the removal of protactinium from the blanket mixture, LiF-BeF2-ThF4 (73-2-25 mole %), by methods which can be feasibly adapted as chemical processes. An experimental program has been initiated to study the reduction of protactinium fluorides from this salt mixture by molten lead or bismuth saturated with thorium metal at about 400°C.

The primary objective of initial experiments with this program has been the study of protactinium removal from the salt phase of the extraction system. For these experiments, sufficient 237Pa was obtained for radiochemical analysis by neutron irradiation of a small quantity of ThO2. The simulated blanket mixture was prepared from its components, together with the irradiated ThO2, in nickel equipment. This mixture was treated at 600°C with an HF-H2 mixture (1:10 volume ratio) to remove oxide ion and at 700°C with H2 alone to reduce structural-metal impurities. The metal-phase extractant, lead or bismuth with added thorium metal, was prepared in the extraction vessel (type 304L stainless steel with a low-carbon steel liner) by treatment with H2 at 600°C. In each experiment, 237Pa was rapidly removed from the salt phase and remained absent from the solution during the approximately 100 hr at 600°C while tests were made.

The objective of experiments now in progress is to examine methods for recovering 233Pa from the extraction system. The proposed use of macro quantities of 231Pg may be required to circumvent the anticipated adsorption of the micro quantities of 233Pa, currently used, on the walls of the container or on other insoluble species in the system.

Solubility of Thorium in Molten Lead. Current studies of the blanket of the reference-design MSPR have been directed toward the development of a liquid-liquid extraction process. The method proposes that protactinium, as PaF, in a salt phase, can be recovered to its metallic state and extracted into a molten metal phase. The possible use of a molten mixture of thorium in lead would provide a convenient method for combining the reducing agent with the metal-phase extractant and for replenishing thorium to the fluoride blanket mixture. The objective of this study has been to establish the solubility of thorium in lead over the temperature range of interest to this program and to provide a lead-thorium solution of known composition for subsequent protactinium extraction experiments.

The experimental mixture, contained in low-carbon steel, consisted of approximately 3 kg of lead and 100 g of thorium-metal chips. Values for the solubility of thorium were obtained by analyses of filtered samples withdrawn from the melt at selected temperatures over the interval 400 to 600°C under assumed equilibrium conditions. Samples were withdrawn during two heating and cooling cycles and submitted for activation and spectrographic analyses. These results, plotted as the logarithm of the solubility vs. the reciprocal of the absolute temperature in 0.11, indicate that the heat of solution of thorium in lead is approximately 19 kcal/mole and that its solubility at 600°C is about 1. 85 x 10^-5 mol.

Protactinium Studies in the High-Alpha Molten-Salt Laboratory. Experiments on extraction of protactinium from a breeder-blanket mixture, LiF-ThF (73-27 mole %), by liquid-metal extraction at the tracer level (fraction of a part per million parts of ^33Pa) are described in the section "Removal of Protactinium from Molten Fluoride by Reduction Processes" of this report. Results reported here indicate that a large fraction of the reduced protactinium disappears from molten lead in a tantalum container, in agreement with the tracer-level experiments, but one sample indicated that 17% of the protactinium remained after about 6 hr at 625°C.

The completed experiment, runs 1-12, were conducted in several stages with the furnace cooled to room temperature between stages. In the first operation, a 17 M HI solution containing 9 mg of purified 231Pa was mixed with 4.0 g of irradiated ThF4 containing about 1 mg of 33Pa. The salt was heated in a platinum dish to evaporate water and HF, and the dried mixture was added to a nickel pot containing 330 g of pretreated LiF-ThF4 (73-27 mole %).

A copper filter unit was placed in the pot, which was sealed, evacuated to 450 u pressure three times and filled with helium each time. The furnace was then heated with helium flowing through the pot under a slight positive pressure. After reaching 600°C, a mixture of HF and H2 was passed through the melt for 50 min to convert any oxide impurities to fluorides, and then the melt was treated with H2 for 4 hr to reduce NiFp, which resulted from the hydrofluorination, to metallic nickel. Apparently because of a too high flow rate, part of the melt splashed up to the top of the pot where it solidified. On attempting to remove the first filtered melt sample, the copper filter was torn loose from the 1/8-in. nickel tubing to which it was attached, and the copper filter fell back into the melt. After cooling, the cake at the top of the melt was broken up.

In the second stage, the pot containing the treated Lir-ThF mixture was connected to a similar pot lined with tantalum and containing 692 g of Pb-Th alloy that had been saturated with thorium at 600°C. The molten salt was transferred to the tantalum-lined pot at 655°C through a transfer line at 600°C by the application of 10 lb of helium pressure to the salt pot. Previous efforts to effect salt transfer had been frustrated by low temperatures in the transfer line resulting from the high vertical temperature gradient above the furnace block, which was mentioned in the previous report. A coiled heater above the block and better insulation at the floor level of the glove box overcame this problem. After the transfer was completed, helium sparging was used to cause mixing of the lead and salt phases. The sparging was interrupted at intervals to permit phase separation. Samples of the salt phase were removed with copper filter units, and samples of the metal phase were normally removed with sintered stainless steel filter units.

At this time, 5.0 g of thorium metal turnings were added to the mixture. Sampling of the two phases 75 minutes later showed a sharp decrease in the gross gamma activity of the salt phase without a consequent increase in the activity of the stainless steel sampler and their contained lead phase sample.

A further 3-hour contact time failed to produce any significant change in the activity of the samples, with one exception: a sample of the metal phase inadvertently obtained in a copper sampler showed a significantly higher activity level, later confirmed by 31Pa analyses, than the stainless steel filtered samples taken before and after the copper samples. The furnace was then allowed to cool to room temperature.

Finally, the lead phase was transferred to an unlined nickel pot containing LiF-ThF, of the same composition used previously but without protactinium. A mixture of hydrogen and anhydrous HCl was bubbled through the lead and salt phases in an effort to convert metallic protactinium in the lead to PaClₓ and transfer it to the salt phase. Time limitations prevented a thorough test of this procedure.

The data obtained in the above-described experiment, runs 1-12, are shown in Table 5.9. The gross gamma values were obtained by weighing a sample, usually 1.000 ± 0.002 g, placing it in a small glass vial, sealing the vial in a plastic envelope as it was removed from the glove box, and then placing the envelope over a sodium iodide crystal that was connected to an RIDL scaler. These samples were then sent for solution and analysis by the alpha-pulse-height method to determine their 231Pb content. The whole metal samples were counted for gross gamma activity in a similar manner. The stainless steel samplers and their lead contents were dissolved separately, and 231Pb analyses were made on the solutions but the copper sampler was dissolved along with the lead sample that it contained. The amount of lead in each sampler was also.

The data in Table 5. 9 confirm the conclusion, based on earlier experiments with tracer concentrations of 77Pa, that protactinium fluoride is reduced to the metallic state by thorium dissolved in lead. It further appears that most of the protactinium does not stay dissolved in the lead phase long enough to permit transfer of the lead to another container for recovery of the protactinium by hydrofluorination, but a small fraction of the protactinium was apparently recovered in this fashion.

May indicate that the tendency of protactinium to absorb ion, or alloy with, iron causes the protactinium to be removed from the lead sample during its passage through the sintered stainless steel filter material. An effort was made to remove any protactinium-containing material adhering to the outside wall of the samplers after they cooled to room temperature prior to analysis. They were scraped and also given an acid treatment before they were dissolved. It is not clear at present.

The transfer of a small fraction of the protactinium from the lead phase to a molten fluoride mixture by HF treatment, as indicated by preliminary results, is encouraging. However, means of preventing the loss of the major part of the protactinium by adsorption on or alloying with container walls or other materials will obviously be sought in continuing experiments.

Design, development, and fabrication of the in-pile molten-salt experiment continued. Modifications to beam hole NN-1 in the ORR, and installation of experimental equipment are scheduled to begin early in April, and in-pile operation of the first irradiation experiment will begin in June 1966.

Auxiliary equipment needed to modify beam hole HN-1 for the molten salt experiments has been fabricated. This equipment consists of (1) a new aluminum beam-hole liner, (2) a beam-hole extension sleeve, and (3) an equipment chamber located at the face of the reactor shielding, which will contain tanks and valves required to remove salt samples and add makeup salt to the autoclave during in-pile operation.

Component parts of the experiment package which have been fabricated are the shield plug, the loop container can, and the connector, as shown in Fig. 12. A photograph of the partially assembled thermal-loop experiment is shown in Fig. 13. The 12-ft-long sample line with electric heating elements, which are bonded to the sample line by means of nickel metal spray, has also been completed along with the main loop-heater-cooler unit. The heater-cooler unit design, previously described, has been changed by substituting cooling tubes of Zircaloy-2 instead of stainless steel and Zircaloy-2 for the heater-cooler jacket in lieu of graphite. This change was made to reduce the attenuation of neutron flux and to provide for improvements in the efficiency and operational flexibility of the heater-cooler unit by using a Zircaloy-2 metal-spraying technique to attach the heaters and cooling coils.

The study of hydrofluorination as a way to determine oxide in MSRE salts was continued. This method is based on the reaction that occurs when a molten-salt sample is purged with an H2-HF gas mixture. The amount of water evolved is taken as a measure of the quantity of oxide in the molten-salt sample. Data have been reported previously for the Karl Fischer titration of the water evolved from standard additions of ZrO2 and UO2 to a 50-g fuel melt.

Figure 5. 14 is a schematic flow diagram of the hydrofluorination apparatus now being used. Since it would be difficult to perform the Karl Fischer titration in the hot cell, a P20 water electrolysis cell (Beckmann moisture-monitor cell with rhodium electrodes) was installed in a component test facility to monitor the effluent gas stream from the hydrofluorinator for water.

To establish the conditions necessary to use the electrolysis cell as a water monitor, ZrO2 samples were added to 50 g of MSRE fuel in the hydrofluorinator. Because there is a maximum rate of water electrolysis beyond which the cell may be damaged, it was necessary to split the effluent-gas stream and to pass only a portion of it through the cell. After the optimum gas pressures and flow rates were established, the results given in Table 5. 10 were obtained.

Figure 5. 15 is a recording of the water evolved from two standard additions of ZrO₂ to a fuel sample. The first two peaks of each recording result from atmospheric contaminants introduced during loading of the ZrO₂ into the fuel sample and removal of contamination from the internal metal surfaces of the apparatus. After the fuel-ZrO₂ sample was melted, it was purged with H₂-HF at 625°C to evolve the oxide.

Also, analyses were made on ~50-g portions sampled from 6 kg of simulated molten MSRE fuel of unknown oxide concentration. These samples were taken in copper ladles, cooled to room temperature, and then transferred to the hydrofluorinator under an inert atmosphere. Three of the samples were exposed to the atmosphere since the samples from the reactor will be exposed while being transferred to the hydrofluorinator.

Initial purge with H2-HF was made at a temperature below the melting point to remove oxide from the metal surfaces and oxide contamination from the surface of the salt. Table 5. 11 lists the results.

We must here consider whether these results represent a quantitative removal of oxide or simply a return to an original equilibrium baseline. It may be seen by rearranging the equilibrium expression for the reaction of oxide with HF that if the proportion of HF reagent in the purge gas is increased, the residual oxide concentration will be.

Because the HF reagent contains traces of water, the HF concentration in the influent cannot be increased independently. However, if the concentrations of HF and H2O in the purge gas are doubled, the residual oxide in the melt should be reduced by a factor of 2.

HF in the sparge gas through terminal (oxide-depleted) melts was doubled. No additional water was obtained. Also, equilibrium constants are temperature-dependent, and no additional peaks were observed with temperature variations of 200°C on depleted melts.

The apparatus designed for the determination, in the hot cell, of the oxide in highly radioactive fuel samples is functionally identical to the components test facility used for the analyses reported above. Figure 5. 18 shows the hydrofluorinator positioned in the furnace, which is external to the valve compartment.

The reactor is put on stream through O-ring ball joints that are closed or opened by a remotely operated argon-actuated air piston. The valve compartment contains the sodium fluoride trap, the capillary water splitter, the P205 water electrolysis cell, and the soda-lime trap for cleaning the effluent gas stream. These components are shown in Fig. 5. 19, where the cover plate has been removed. The modular construction was chosen in hopes that any maintenance necessary can be performed remotely. If not, any component can be removed manually in 2 to 5 min if the hot cell is sufficiently decontaminated.

Figure 5. 20 shows the disassembled hydrofluorinator. The copper sample ladle is contained in the nickel liner, which fits into the bottom of the hydrofluorinator. The baffles on the spring-loaded sparge tube fit inside the liner and confine the molten salt to the liner during the bubbling operation of the analysis.

Figure 5. 21 shows the H2-HF mixer section, which is located in the access area behind the hot cell. The HF pressure is regulated by controlling the temperature of the HF tank shown on the left. The flow rates of the Hg and HF are controlled by nickel and platinum capillaries, respectively. This apparatus also contains safety interlocks and limiting capillaries to prevent the release of HF and excessive pressures inside.

Figure 5. 22 shows the master control panel, which is located in front of the hot cell. This panel contains the moisture recorder (not shown), helium and hydrogen pressure controls; HF control switch; hydrofluorinator coupler switch; temperature recorder; furnace power controls; and power control for the coupler-line heater.

After they were fabricated, the apparatus and auxiliary equipment were assembled in the hot-cell mockup, and all mechanical operations were performed successfully with Master-Slave manipulators. The equipment was then transferred to the laboratory and assembled on the benchtop for trial analyses of samples. Individual components were tested exhaustively and, when necessary, were modified or replaced to obtain maximum dependability and to minimize hot-cell maintenance.

By controlled-potential voltammetry, Fe and W were determined in a 100-g sample of MSRE fuel. The sample was withdrawn from the reactor in enricher ladles and was transferred under an inert atmosphere to the graphite crucible of an electrochemical cell assembly for remelting and analysis. The cell assembly and electrodes developed for electrochemical studies of molten-fluoride salts are described elsewhere. The iron and nickel in the molten fuel are suspected to be in the metallic state, as well as in the form of soluble ionic species. However, only in the divalent oxidation state are these metals electroreducible in the melt and can thus give voltammetric reduction waves. By voltammetry and by the standard-addition technique, the concentration of Fe was determined to be ~10 ppm. The concentration of W was below the limit of detection by voltammetry (<1 ppm).

Average total concentrations of iron and nickel, determined by conventional methods, are about 125 and 45 ppm, respectively. Thus, it appears that most of the iron and nickel in the fuel is present in the metallic state, probably as finely divided particles.

Chromium concentration, determined conventionally, is ~50 ppm. Interference from uranium prevents the voltammetric determination of chromium in the molten salt. A well-defined wave was observed that corresponds to the reduction U(IV) - U(III). Possibly, this wave can be used to continuously monitor uranium in the system. More work is contemplated in this area.

In an attempt to eliminate the bias, steps 1, 4, and 6 were modified. The determination of the blank was eliminated. The cutoff point for the uranium and copper reduction was changed from 5 ya to 50 wa. An X-Y recorder (0. 23) was attached to the coulometer to monitor the titrations. When the readout voltage and cell current were plotted on the X and Y scales, respectively, a straight line with a negative slope was obtained after the recorder pen had reached a maximum Y value. Due to the error introduced by this technique, a potentiometer was connected to the integrator circuit of the coulometer in order to obtain more precise readout voltages. This necessitated terminating the titrations at a specific end point.

50 was found empirically to be the most practical point of termination. The coulometer was automatically turned off when the ammeter needle indicated a cell current of 50 μA. At this point, the titration was approximately 99% complete. This portion of the readout voltage was taken from the potentiometer; the remaining readout voltage was obtained by extrapolating from 50 to 0 μA on an expanded cell current vs. readout voltage curve (0. 25). The two readings were combined to obtain the total readout voltage for the uranium and copper reduction.

The quality control program initiated prior to pre-critical sampling was continued during the past period. Synthetic solutions similar to dissolved nonradioactive fuel-salt samples were analyzed along with each flush-salt and fuel-salt sample. Due to the relatively small number of samples analyzed to date, the accumulated control data is insufficient to calculate the true percent standard deviations of the methods. The values shown in Table 5. 13 were obtained during the fourth quarter of 1965. The 2S and average values shown were obtained by four different groups of shift personnel. Molybdenum values are not shown in the table since it was not added to the synthetic solution. The nickel values indicate that a positive bias exists in the method. The values given for the coulometric uranium procedure indicate that the negative bias was eliminated.

Design and evaluation studies have been made of thermal molten-salt breeder reactors (MSBR) in order to assess their economic and nuclear potential and to identify the important design and development problems. The reference reactor design presented here contains design problems related to molten-salt reactors in general.

Figure 6. 1 gives the flowsheet of the 1000-MW (electrical) MSBR power plant. Fuel flows through the reactor at a rate of about 44,000 gpm (velocity of about 15 fps), entering the core at 1000°F and leaving at 1300°F. The primary fuel circuit has four loops, each loop having a pump and a primary heat exchanger. Each of these pumps has a capacity of about 11,000 gpm. The four blanket-salt pumps and heat exchangers, although smaller, are similar to corresponding components in the fuel system. The blanket salt enters the reactor vessel at 1150°F and leaves at 1250°F. The blanket-salt pumps have a capacity of about 2000 gpm.

Four 14,000-gpm coolant pumps circulate the sodium fluoroborate coolant salt, which enters the shell side of the primary heat exchanger at 850°F and leaves at 1112°F. The coolant then circulates through the shell side of 16 once-through superheaters (4 superheaters per pump).

The steam system flowsheet is essentially that of the new TVA Bull Run plant, with modifications to increase the rating to 1000 MW (electrical) and to preheat the working fluid to 700°F prior to entering the heat exchanger-superheater unit. A supercritical power conversion system is used, which is appropriate for molten-salt application and takes advantage of the high-strength structural alloy employed. Use of a supercritical fluid system results in an overall plant thermal efficiency of.

Figure 6. 2 shows a plan view of the MSBR cell arrangement. The reactor cell is surrounded by four shielded cells containing the superheaters and reheater units. These cells can be individually isolated for maintenance. The processing cell, located adjacent to the reactor, is divided into a high-level and a low-level activity area.

Figure 6. 3 shows an elevation view of the reactor and indicates the position of equipment in the various cells. Figure 6. The Hastelloy N reactor vessel has a side wall thickness of about 1-1/4 in. It is designed to operate at 1200°F and 150 psi. The plenum chambers, with 1/4-in. -thick walls, communicate with the external heat exchangers by concentric inlet-outlet piping. The inner pipe has slip joints to accommodate thermal expansion. Bypass flow through these slip joints is about 1% of the total flow. As indicated in Fig. 6. 5, the heat exchangers are suspended from the top of the cell and are located below the reactor. Each fuel pump has a free fluid surface and a storage volume which permit rapid drainage of fuel fluid from the core upon loss of flow. In addition, the fuel salt can be drained to the dump tanks when the reactor is shut down for an extended time. The entire reactor cell is kept at high temperature, while cold fingers and thermal insulation surround structural support members and all special equipment that must be kept at relatively low temperatures. The control-rod drives are located above the core, and the control rods are inserted into the central region of the core.

The reactor vessel, about 14 ft in diameter by about 15 ft high, contains a 10-ft-diameter core assembly composed of reentry-type graphite fuel cells. The graphite tubes are attached to the two plenum chambers at the bottom of the reactor with graphite-to-metal transition sleeves. Fuel from the entrance plenum flows up fuel passages in the outer region of the fuel cell and down through a single central passage to the exit plenum. The fuel flows from the exit plenum to the heat exchangers, then to the pump, and back to the reactor. A 1-1/2-ft-thick molten-salt blanket plus a 1/4-ft-thick graphite reflector surround the core. The blanket salt also permeates the interstices of the core lattice so that fertile material flows through the core without mixing with the fissile fuel salt.

Figure 6. 6 shows a cross-section of a fuel cell. Fuel fluid flows upward through the small passages and downward through the large central salt, filling the interstices. The nominal core composition is 75% graphite, 18% fuel salt, and 7% blanket salt by volume.

The primary objectives of fuel processing are to purify and recycle fissile and carrier components and to minimize fissile inventory while holding losses to a low value. The fluoride volatility-vacuum distillation process fulfills these objectives through simple operations.

The core fuel is conveniently processed by fluoride volatility and vacuum distillation. The effluent U1 is absorbed by fuel salt and reduced to UF6 by treatment with hydrogen to reconstitute a fuel-salt mixture of the desired composition.

Molten-salt reactors are inherently suited to the design of processing facilities integral with the reactor plant. These facilities require only a small amount of cell space adjacent to the reactor cell. Additionally, the processing plant's inventory of fissile material is greatly reduced, resulting in low fuel inventory charges and improved fuel utilization characteristics for the reactor.

The principal steps in core and blanket stream processing of the MSBR are shown in Fig. 7. A small side stream of each fluid is continuously withdrawn from the fuel and blanket circulating loops and is circulated through the processing system. After processing, the decontaminated fluids are returned to the reactor at some convenient point— for example, via the fuel and fertile stream storage tanks.

The primary heat exchangers are of the tube-and-shell type. Each shell contains two concentric tube bundles connected in series and attached to fixed tube sheets. The fuel salt flows downward in the outer section of tubes, enters a plenum at the bottom of the exchanger, and then flows upward to the pump through the center section of tubes. Entering at the top, the coolant salt flows on the baffled shell side of the exchanger down the central core, under the barrier that separates the two sections, and up the outer annular section.

Since a large temperature difference exists in the two tube sections, the tube sheets at the bottom of the exchanger are not attached to the shell. The design permits differential tube growth between the two sections without creating troublesome stress problems.

The blanket heat exchangers increase the temperature of the coolant leaving the primary core heat exchangers. Since the coolant-salt temperature rise through the blanket exchangers is small, and the flow rate is relatively high, the exchangers are designed for a single shell-side pass for the coolant salt, although a two-pass flow is retained for the blanket salt in the tubes. Straight tubes with two tube sheets are used.

The superheater is a U-tube U-shell exchanger using disk and donut baffles with varying spacing. It is a long, slender exchanger having relatively large baffle spacing. The baffle spacing is established by the shell-side pressure drop and by the temperature gradient across the tube wall and is greatest in the central portion of the exchanger, where the temperature difference between the fluids is high. The supercritical fluid enters the tube side of the superheater at 700°F and 3800 psi and leaves at 1000°F and 3600 psi.

Since the freezing temperature of the secondary salt coolant is about 700°F, a high working-fluid inlet temperature is required. The prime fluid goes through a preheater exchanger and leaves at a pressure of 3550 psi and a temperature of about 870°F. It is then injected into the feedwater in a mixing tee, producing psi by 2 pressurizer (feedwater pump) before the fluid enters the superheater.

Preliminary estimates of the capital cost of a 1000-MW (electrical) MSBR power station indicate a direct construction cost of about $80. 4 million. After applying the indirect cost factors used in the advanced converter evaluation, an estimated total plant cost of $113. 6 million is enough to make meaningful comparisons with previous converter-reactor plant cost studies. The relatively low capital cost estimate obtained results from the small physical size of the MSBR and the simple control requirements. The results of the study encourage the belief that the cost of an MSBR power station will be as low as for stations utilizing other reactor concepts.

The capital costs associated with fuel recycle equipment were obtained by itemizing and costing the major process equipment required and by estimating the costs of site, buildings, instrumentation, waste disposal, and building services associated with fuel recycle.

"The ample MSBR allowance for remote maintenance may be too high, and some of the included replacement equipment allowances could more logically be classified as operating expenses rather than first capital costs. Based on Bull Run plant cost of $160,000 plus ~37% for uncertainties.

The fuel cycle cost and the fuel yield are closely related, yet independent in the sense that two nuclear designs can have similar costs but significantly different yields. The objective of the nuclear design calculations was primarily to find the conditions that gave the lowest fuel cycle cost, and then, without appreciably increasing this cost, the highest fuel yield.

A combination of an optimization code with the MERC multigroup diffusion limits in order to determine an optimum by the method of steepest ascent. The designs were optimized essentially for minimum fuel cycle cost, with lesser weight given to maximizing the annual fuel yield. Typical parameters varied were the reactor dimensions, blanket thickness, fractions of fuel and fertile salts in the core, and fuel and fertile stream processing rates.

Several equations were included in the code for approximating certain capital and operating costs that vary with the design parameters (e. g. , capital cost of the reactor vessel, which varies with the reactor dimensions). These costs were automatically added to the fuel cycle cost in the optimization routine so that the optimization search would take into account all known economic factors.

The broad group cross-sections for these calculations. It was assumed that all nuclides in the reactor system are at their equilibrium concentrations. Uranium-234 was within 95% of equilibrium after eight years, while Uranium-236 was within 80% after ten years.

The processing costs are based on those given in the section entitled Capital Cost Estimates and are included in the fuel cycle costs. The capital and operating costs were estimated separately for each stream as a function of plant throughput, based on the volume of salt processed.

In addition to the basic processing scheme employed, results were also obtained for the case where protactinium can be removed directly from the blanket stream. The improvement in performance under these circumstances is a measure of the incentive to develop protactinium removal ability.

Corrosion Product Behavior. The control of corrosion products in molten-salt fuels does not appear to be a significant problem, and the effect of corrosion products was neglected in the nuclear calculations. The processing method considered here can control corrosion product buildup in the fuel.

The important parameters describing the MSBR design are given in Table 6. 1. Many of the parameters were basically fixed by the ground rules for the evaluation or by the engineering design. These include the thermal efficiency, plant factor, capital charge rate, maximum fuel velocity, size of fuel tubes, processing costs, fissile loss rate, and the out-of-core fuel inventory. The parameters which were optimized by OPTIMERC were the reactor dimensions, the power density, the core composition, including the CFU and Th/U ratios, and the processing rates.

Nuclear Performance. The results of the calculations for the MSBR design are given in Table 6.7, and the neutron balance is provided in Table 6.8. The basic design has the inherent advantage of no neutron losses to structural materials other than the moderator. Except for some unavoidable loss of delayed neutrons in the external fuel circuit, there is almost zero neutron leakage from the reactor due to the thick blanket. The neutron losses to fission products are minimized by the availability of rapid and inexpensive integrated processing.

Fuel Cycle Cost. The components of the fuel cycle cost for the MSBR are given in Table 6. 9. The main components are the fissile inventory and processing costs. The inventory costs are rather rigid for a given reactor design since they are largely determined by the assumed external fuel volume. The processing costs are, of course, a function of the processing cycle times, one of the chief parameters optimized in this.

MSBR Performance with Protactinium Removal Scheme. The ability to remove protactinium directly from the blanket of the MSBR has a marked effect on fuel yield and fuel cycle cost. This is due primarily to the marked decrease in protactinium neutron absorptions when protactinium is removed from the blanket region. A simple and inexpensive scheme for the without protactinium removal is also given in the table.

Table 6. 11 illustrates the economic advantage of MSBRs as nuclear power plants. Also, the fuel utilization characteristics, as measured by the product of the specific inventory and the square of the doubling time, are excellent. 5 years, while the MSBR (Pa) is comparable to the same fast breeder with a doubling time of 6 years.

A close-coupled facility for processing the fuel and fertile streams of a molten-salt breeder reactor (MSBR) will be an integral part of the reactor system. Studies are in progress for obtaining data relevant to the engineering design of such a processing facility. The processing plant will operate on a side stream withdrawn from the fuel stream, which circulates through the reactor core and the primary heat exchanger. For a 1000-MW (electrical) MSBR, approximately 14.1 ft of salt per day will be processed, which will result in a fuel-salt cycle time of approximately 40 days.

The probable method for fuel-stream and fertile-stream processing fluorinator off-gas (consisting of UF6, excess F2, and volatile fission product fluorides) by use of NaF sorption. A semi-continuous vacuum distillation will then be carried out on the remaining salt for the removal of the rare earths, barium, strontium, and yttrium. These fission products will be removed from the still in a salt volume equivalent to 0. 5% of the stream. A small fraction of salt may also have to be discarded at some stage in the process for removal of fission products such as zirconium, rubidium, and cesium. The barren salt, the purified UF6, and the makeup salt will then be recombined. This step involves reduction of UF6 to UF4, mixing of these streams, and sparging the resultant material with an H2-HF stream. Finally, the salt mixture will be filtered before return to the reactor.

The present concept of the distillation step in the MSBR processing plant will use a continuous feed stream and vapor removal; however, there will be a buildup of less volatile fission products (FP) in a static pool of liquid in the still, with periodic discard. Fission products will be allowed to build up in the still liquid until the heat generation rate becomes excessive, or until the liquid FP concentration becomes too large for useful decontamination.

One measure of the decontamination achieved in the distillation process is the relative volatility of the nonvolatile fission products as compared with the carrier salt.

The importance of relative volatility in determining the operating characteristics of a distillation system is shown by the following calculation. Consider a material balance of an FP in the proposed distillation process. The amount of FP fed into the still per unit time (Fx) must equal the FP leaving the still per unit time (Dy), plus the rate of change of FP in the still liquid d(Vx)/dt.

Figure 7. 2 shows the effect of relative volatility on the fraction of FP retained in the liquid for different values of α as a function of time for a feed rate of 14. 1 ft of salt per day and a liquid volume of 4 £03. 001 is carrier salt; it is necessary to determine the concentration of the FP in the vapor at equilibrium with a known liquid composition.

Phase of development: Exact operating conditions in the still have not pressure of mixture. Since the MSBR carrier salt is a mixture of LiF and BeF2, the exact composition of the carrier salt or solvent in the still liquid will be dependent on operating temperature and pressure. However, in the temperature range of interest, the major portion of the still carrier salt will be the less volatile LiF. Therefore, #11 experimental tests were made with binary mixtures of LiF and FP fluoride. In later tests, multicomponent systems will be used.

The fission products contaminants of main concern are the rare earths. Of these, the ones which will be present in the largest amount or which will present the largest neutron losses are Nd, Sm, Pm, Pr, Hf, La, and Ce. These fission products will probably be present as the trifluoride, with the exception of cerium, which might be present partially as the tetravalent.

The equipment used for determining relative volatilities was a simple equilibrium still with a cold finger in the vapor phase. This still was constructed from 1-inch nickel tubing for the liquid and disengagement space, and 5/8-inch tubing for the vapor space through which a 3/8-inch nickel cold finger was inserted. The top of the vapor section was connected to vacuum and inert gas. The entire assembly was placed in a 5-inch-diameter tube furnace. Thermocouples were inserted in the still through thermowells in the liquid phase and at three points in the vapor phase. During a test, the temperature measured at the three lower points was maintained within 5°C of a predetermined value.

The cold finger could be cooled by air, water, or a combination of both. This was done by introducing the coolant through a center 1/8-inch diameter tube and removing it through the annular space between the 1/8- and minute and 11. 4 standard liters of air per minute. This rapid cooling would prevent preferential condensation of the less volatile component.

The experimental procedure used was to first charge the still with a known mixture of LiF-FP fluoride. Then, after the still was filled with an inert gas (purified helium or argon), it was brought to the desired temperature. At this point, the still was subjected to a vacuum pump with the capability of reducing the pressures to less than 50 mm Hg. After the temperature and pressure reached an apparent steady state, the cold finger was cooled for 2 to 4 minutes for the collection of a vapor sample.

Experimental tests have been conducted on all the significant rare-earth fluorides, except for promethium. The results are provided in Table 7. 1. They demonstrate a high level of consistency and align well with the findings reported by Kelly in the research on Evaporative Distillation Studies on Molten-Salt Fuel Components within this report's subsection.

A necessary step in the processing of the MSBR fuel is the recombination of the purified uranium hexafluoride with the purified carrier salt, which includes reduction of UF6, the product of the fluorination step, to UP6. The usual method for reducing UF6 to UF4 uses excess hydrogen in an HF-F2 gas flame, which produces hydrogen fluoride as a byproduct. The resulting UF4 powder is collected at the base of a tall reaction vessel. Although this operation has been reduced to routine production, it appears undesirable for radiochemical application because of the inherent solids handling problem. An alternative is the reduction of UF6 to U4 in a molten salt, involving only gases and liquids. When UF6 is contacted with a molten fluoride salt containing UF4, it is absorbed with reaction to form intermediate fluorides of uranium such as UF5. Initial but definitive tests have shown this alternative to be quite feasible. A tower which might serve well to conduct this sequence of reactions is shown in Fig.

At which the reactions proceed. It is believed that the addition of UF6 to a molten salt containing UF4 results in the formation of dissolved fluorides of uranium with a valence intermediate between 4+ and 6+. Similar behavior is also noted in reactions between UF6 and UF4 in the absence of molten salt to yield an intermediate.

Fluorides such as UF6. It could be expected that the homogeneous reaction rate would be very rapid, and that the absorption rate would probably depend on diffusion to and from the interface. Previous data on the reduction of uranium fluorides intermediate between UF5 and UF7 in molten salts do not exist; however, rate data may be inferred from the reduction of U3N8 with hydrogen in molten mixtures of LiF and BeF2 performed by Long. He observed that the ratio of the concentrations of hydrogen and HF in gas bubbles rising through the molten salt reached equilibrium in only a few inches. His data also indicate only a 1% reduction of UF6 to U13 by a gas stream containing 1% HF in hydrogen at pressures of 1 atm at 600°C.

The trap was used only for trapping UF from the vessel off-gas during UF. In addition to the molten salt, another trap was used for all other lines. It was located in the center of the vessel and terminated 1/4 in. from the bottom of the vessel. A 3/4-in. fitting on the top flange allowed the insertion of a cold, 3/8-in. nickel rod, which was used for sampling. The vessel was heated by two Nichrome-wire resistance furnaces.

Three experiments were carried out at 600°C in which UF6 was introduced at the rate of 1. 5 g/min at a point 12 in. below the surface of a molten LiF-ZrF4 mixture containing ~0. 5 mole % UF6. The initial salt (0. 197 g-mole of UF6) had a melting point of approximately 510°C. Complete absorption of the UF6 was observed during each of the tests, which resulted in the absorption of a total of 147 g of UF6 during a period of 98 min.

During a typical run, the salt charge from the previous run was heated to 600°C and sparged with N2 for 15 min at the rate of 100 cm/min (STP), after which a salt sample was taken. The salt was then sparged with HF at the rate of 0. Uranium hexafluoride was then bubbled into the salt at a rate of 1. 5 g/min for a specified length of time, with the vessel off-gas passing through an Naf bed used exclusively during this period. The salt was then sparged with H2 at the rate of 95 cm/min (STP) for 30 min and sampled, after which the H2 sparge was continued for an additional 30 min.

Two questions related to the experimental work are of primary interest: (1) the fraction of UF6 that was absorbed by the molten salt, and (2) the valence of the uranium in the resulting mixture. It was concluded that, within the accuracy of the experimental data, complete absorption of the UF6 by the molten salt had occurred. No uranium was found on the Nal trap used during the UF6 addition period. The concentration of UF6 in the salt sample taken after UF6 addition was below the limit of detection of 0. 05 wt%. Reduction of the uranium to UF4 probably occurred during the addition of UF6 by the reaction of the intermediate fluorides with nickel from the vessel wall.

From these tests, it appears that UP could be rapidly absorbed by molten fluoride salt containing about 1 wt% UF at 600°C, and that the intermediate fluoride formed could be reduced with hydrogen to UF6. Subsequent studies are recommended to provide more quantitative data for engineering design; however, this form of recombination of UF6 with the purified carrier salt will be indicated on all subsequent flowsheets.

Since the presence of uranium in the distillation step to separate the carrier salt from the fission products would cause unnecessary complications, it is removed continuously in a prior fluorination step. Previous experience with the removal of uranium from molten salt by fluorination includes the operation of the Molten Salt Fluoride Volatility Pilot Plant at ORNL. In this facility, batch fluorinations completely volatilized the uranium as UF6, which allowed its subsequent purification and recovery by absorption and cold trapping. Observed corrosion in this facility was severe but acceptable in a batch process of this sort. However, it would be intolerable in a continuous unit or in any unit with enough capacity to handle the processing stream for an MSBR. A possible solution to the corrosion problem is the operation of the fluorination vessel, presently envisioned as a tower, with a layer of frozen salt on the vessel wall. In application to the MSBR fluorinator, internal heat generation will be provided by the fission product decay heat.

Successful tests were also made at ORNL using ohmic heating to provide the internal heat generation. It was found that a gas flow could be maintained through an unheated line, which entered the fluorinator vessel at a point below the molten salt surface when a frozen salt layer was present on the fluorinator wall.

Experimental studies of continuous fluorination of molten salt are being made in a 1-inch-diameter nickel column with a salt depth of 48 inches. No provision is being made in the present experimental work for corrosion protection by a frozen layer of salt. Fluorination tests in which 15 cm/min of molten salt (NaF-LiF-ZrF4) containing 0.5 wt% UF6 were contacted countercurrently with 70 cm/min of F2 (STP) at 600°C showed removal of uranium from the salt at 96 to 99.4% efficiency during a 1-hour period of continuous operation. Material balances were complicated by the inevitable corrosion of the nickel vessel. Complete removal.

Upon the conclusion of tests on the MSRE, uranium will be recovered from the fuel salt as Ulg by sparging the salt with Fo. Fluorides of chromium will be present in the fuel salt as a result of corrosion of reactor piping and of equipment used for hydrofluorination or fluorination of the salt.

In the fluorinator off-gas, these fluorides cannot only contaminate the UF6 product but also render equipment inoperative by deposition in lines, valves, etc. A study has been completed, which will permit the design of a trapping system for removing these fluorides from the off-gas, which will also contain UF6 and F2.

Experiments were carried out in which 1 liter/min of F2 (STP) was sparged through a molten NaF-LiF-ZrF3 mixture at 650°C, which contained 0.5 to 4 wt% CrF3. The resulting off-gas containing fluorine and volatile fluorides of chromium then passed through beds of pelleted NaF at 400°C for the removal of chromium fluorides. In some tests, a U1 flow of 100 cm/min was added to the F2.

It can be concluded that (1) fixed beds of NaF at 400°C are effective in removing fluorides of chromium from a gas stream which also contains UF and Fo. (2) Pelleted NaF having a surface area of 0. 074 m²/g and a void fraction of 0. 45 and has an effective capacity of about 20 g of chromium per 100 g of NaF. (3) Uranium losses to the 400°C NaF bed of less than 0. 01% are achievable when working with a gas stream that contains 0. 4 mole of CrFs per mole of UF in Fo.

Design studies of this report. The study evaluated the engineering feasibility and costs for a plant that operated continuously as an integral part of the reactor system, being located in two cells adjacent to the reactor cell. The plant was designed to treat 15 ft/day of fuel salt and 105 ft/day of fertile salt. The fuel salt was an LiF-BeF2 (69-31 mole %) mixture containing the fissionable 37UF, fertile salt was a 71-29 mole % mixture of LiF-ThF4. The lithium component of each selected to give the optimum combination of fuel cycle cost and breeding.

The primary objective of the fuel process is to recover uranium and carrier salts sufficiently decontaminated from fission and corrosion products so that the reactor has an attractive breeding potential. The recovered materials are recycled to the reactor, and the fission products are discarded. Only four major operations are required to accomplish this for the fuel stream: fluorination, sorption of UF6, vacuum distillation, and salt reconstitution. These operations are shown schematically.

As it enters the processing cell, fuel salt is only a few seconds removed from the fission zone and is extremely radioactive. The stream column is contacted by a countercurrent stream of fluorine, which strips out the uranium according to the reaction.

The system, consisting of molten LiF-BeF2-UF4, fission products, and elemental fluorine, is extremely corrosive to the walls of the fluorinator, requiring clever design if a significant lifetime is to be obtained. It is proposed to jacket the fluorinator with a coolant that will maintain the column to shield the wall from the molten salt. A schematic diagram of the fluorinator is shown in Fig. 8.

The gas stream leaving the fluorinator passes through a sorption system composed of temperature-controlled beds of NaI and MgF2 pellets. The first section of the NaF bed is held at about 400°C and sorbs most of the fission products; the second section of the bed is at about 100°C.

Sorbs technetium, part of the molybdenum, and UF6, and allows the remaining fission products to pass. Upon heating from 100 to 400°C, the second section of the sorber releases molybdenum, technetium, and UF6, which passes through MgI2 for retention of technetium while allowing UF6 to pass. Uranium hexafluoride is frozen in cold traps and retained for recycling to the reactor.

Uranium-free salt flows from the fluorinator into a continuous distillation unit, which is operated at about 1 mm Hg pressure and 1000°C. Under these conditions, it is possible to distill LiF and BeF2 from the bulk of the fission products. Rare-earth fission products are much less volatile than lithium or beryllium fluoride, allowing a good separation to be achieved. Zirconium fluoride, however, is sufficiently volatile that this fission product will contaminate the LiF-BeF2 product.

In this study, the vacuum still was a 2.5-ft-diameter by 4-ft-high vessel containing a bank of cooling tubes over most of its height. A condensing surface at the top condensed and collected the overhead product. To initiate the operation, the interior of the still is charged with 4 ft of molten LiF. The still is evacuated and brought to temperature, and salt from the fluorinator is allowed to flow into the pool of molten LiF. Temperature is controlled so that liquid is vaporized at the same rate at which it enters the still. There is no bottom discharge, so the still volume remains constant. Accordingly, the concentration of fission.

Products steadily increase in the 4 ft of LiF. After about 67 days of operation, the accumulated heat generation rate (see 0. 9) has become so great that the heat removal capability of the cooling system is reached. The still contents are then drained to waste storage, and the operation is repeated. Heat is removed by forced circulation of NaK on the shell side of the tubes.

The concentration factor for rare-earth fission products in the still is about 250. The fraction of the process stream, which is almost entirely 7LiF, discarded at this point is slightly less than 0. 4%. Because of the volatility of ZrF4, an additional discard of the distillate is required to purge this fission product. As much as a 5% throwaway might be necessary in this type of operation. At the time of this study, data were not available to assess the effect of increasing fission product concentration in the still on relative volatilities. Consequently, the overall decontamination factor (DF) of the distillate cannot be predicted accurately, but it is believed that a DF of at least 100 can.

The final step in fuel processing is reconstitution to make a suitable feed for the reactor. The LiF-BeF2 distillate is admitted to a reduction column containing molten (~600°C) LiF-BeF2-UF4 that is approximately the correct fuel composition. Concurrently, gaseous UF6 from the cold traps is introduced near the bottom of the column, and hydrogen gas is admitted at a point a little farther up the column. The UF6 absorbs in the molten salt to form an intermediate fluoride of uranium, such as UF5, which reacts with H2 according to the reaction at this point. The reconstituted fuel is sent to the reactor core to complete the fuel processing cycle.

The fertile stream process consists only of continuous fluorination and UF purification by sorption. The operation is analogous to the corresponding fuel stream operation but at a higher volumetric rate. The dwell time of the fertile stream is purposely kept short (20 to 25 days) to keep a low uranium concentration in the blanket, thereby keeping the fission rate low. The low fission rate ensures a low fission product accumulation rate so that it is unnecessary to remove them on the same cycle as uranium. In fact, a 30-year discard cycle of the barren fertile stream is a sufficient purge rate for fission products.

Four waste streams requiring storage leave the processing facility: (1) aqueous waste from the KOH scrubber, (2) NaF and MeFs sorbent from the UF purification system, (3) molten-salt residue from the distillation unit, and (4) molten salt from the fertile-stream discard. The aqueous waste comes from vent-gas scrubbing and is small in volume; it was assumed that this stream could be combined with reactor aqueous wastes for storage. The two molten-salt wastes are stored in underground tanks, and the pelletized sorbents are stored in cylindrical containers in an underground vault. Forced draft cooling is provided for these three storage.

Most of the off-gas from the process comes from the continuous fluorinators. Although fluorine is recycled, a small amount is bled off to purge gaseous fission products. The off-gas is scrubbed with an aqueous caustic solution, filtered, and discharged to the atmosphere.

The design study included an estimation of capital and operating costs for the integrated processing plant. Space requirements and costs were estimated for a typical layout adjacent to the reactor system. Each item of major equipment was designed to the extent that a reasonably accurate estimate of its cost could be made. The costs of auxiliary items, such as utilities, piping, instrumentation, electrical connections, insulation, and sampling, were estimated by applying appropriate factors to process equipment costs.
