This compilation of information related to aqueous homogeneous reactors summarizes the results of more than ten years of research and development by Oak Ridge National Laboratory and other organizations. Some 1500 technical man-years of effort have been devoted to this work, the cost of which totals more than $50 million. A summary of a program of this magnitude must necessarily be devoted primarily to the main technical approaches pursued, with less attention to alternate approaches. For more complete coverage, the reader is directed to the selected bibliography at the end of Part I.

Although research in other countries has contributed to the technology of aqueous homogeneous reactors, this review is limited to work in the United States. In a few instances, however, data and references pertaining to work carried on outside the United States are included for continuity.

Review of the manuscript by others of the Oak Ridge Laboratory staff and by scientists and engineers of Argonne National Laboratory and Westinghouse Electric Corporation have improved clarity and accuracy. Suggestions by R. B. Briggs, director of the Homogeneous Reactor Project at the Oak Ridge Laboratory, and G. McLain, consultant to the Argonne Laboratory, were particularly helpful.

Work prior to the Manhattan Project. Nuclear reactors fueled with a solution or homogeneous mixture of fuel and moderator were among the first nuclear systems to be investigated experimentally following the discovery of uranium fission. In fact, it was only slightly more than a year after this discovery that Halban and Kowarski at the Cavendish Laboratory in England performed experiments which indicated to them that a successful self-sustaining chain reaction could be achieved with a slurry of uranium oxide (U3O8) in heavy water.

In these experiments reported in December 1940, 112 liters of heavy water mixed with varying amounts of U3O8 powder were used inside an aluminum sphere 60 cm in diameter, which was immersed in about one ton of heavy mineral oil to serve as a reflector. Mineral oil was chosen to avoid contamination of the D2O in case of a leak in the sphere. By measuring neutron fluxes at varying distances from a neutron source located in the center of the sphere, Halban and Kowarski calculated a multiplication factor of 1.18 + 0.07 for this system when the ratio of deuterium atoms to uranium atoms was 380 to 1, and 1.09 + 0.

Other experiments conducted at the same time by Halban and Kowarski indicated that with a heterogeneous lattice arrangement, it would be possible to achieve multiplication factors as high as 1.37 in a system containing about 100 atoms of deuterium per atom of uranium.

It is interesting to note that the D2O used in the experiments had been evacuated from France. The D2O originally came from the laboratories of the Norwegian Hydroelectric Company, and with the destruction of this plant and its D2O stockpile in 1942, this was the sole remaining supply of purified D2O. However, it was not enough to allow a self-sustaining chain reaction to be established with natural uranium.

Because it was clear even by early 1942 that the only feasible homogeneous reactor using natural uranium would be one moderated with D2O, and because no D2O was available at that time for use in reactors, interest in homogeneous reactor systems was purely academic. The atomic energy program, which was then getting well under way, devoted its attention to heterogeneous reactors. By using a heterogeneous lattice arrangement with a core of uranium metal slugs spaced inside graphite blocks and a periphery containing U3O8 slugs (used after the supply of uranium metal ran out) spaced inside the graphite, the first successful self-sustaining chain reaction was achieved on December 2, 1942.

Early homogeneous reactor development programs at Columbia and Chicago universities interest in homogeneous reactors lagged until early in 1943 when it became clear that American and Canadian efforts to produce large quantities of heavy water would be successful. At that time, the group under H. C. Urey at Columbia University directed its attention to the development of slurried reactors utilizing uranium oxide and D2O.

In March 1943, Urey and Fermi held a conference to review the situation with respect to homogeneous reactors. They noted the value of 1.18 that Halban and Kowarski had obtained for the multiplication factor in a UzOs-D2O slurry reactor and pointed out that the value calculated from theory was only 1. 02. They realized, however, that neither the theory nor the experiment was free from serious objections and that insufficient data were available to allow a trustworthy conclusion to be reached as to the feasibility of homogeneous systems.

If the results of Halban and Kowarski were correct, then a homogeneous system containing a few tons of heavy water would be chain reacting. On the other hand, if the theoretical estimates were correct, the order of 100 tons of D2O would be required.

From theoretical considerations by E. P. Wigner and others, it appeared that the most favorable arrangement for a U-30g-D20 reactor would be one in which the slurry was pumped through a lattice of tubes immersed in D2O moderator. This was especially true because the neutron absorption cross-section assigned to heavy water at that time made it appear that more than 200 tons of D2O would be required to reach criticality in an entirely homogeneous system in which the U-30g and moderator were mixed. With a heterogeneous system, it seemed likely that a much smaller quantity of D2O would suffice, and every effort was directed toward preparing a design that would require about 50 tons of D2O.

It was estimated by E. P. Wigner that the uranium concentration in the slurry would have to be 2.5 to 3 grams per cubic centimeter of slurry. It became apparent immediately that no aqueous solution of a uranium compound could be made with such a density. With pure UF6, 2.48 grams of uranium per cubic centimeter could be obtained, and piles utilizing this compound were considered. However, the corrosion problems in such a system were believed to be so severe that the development of a reactor to operate at a high power level would be extremely difficult, if not impossible.

Other compounds, such as uranyl nitrate dissolved in D2O, were excluded because in the case of nitrate, the neutron absorption of nitrogen was too high, and in other cases, sufficient densities could not be obtained. Thus, the initial phase of the research at Columbia was directed toward the development of high-density slurries.

The reactor visualized by the Columbia group was one in which an extremely dense suspension of uranium in D2O would be pumped through a large number of pipes arranged inside a heavy-water moderator. It was planned that both the slurry and the moderator would be circulated through heat exchangers for cooling.

Then, in July of 1948, the experiments of Langsdorf were completed, giving a much lower cross-section for deuterium than was known earlier. As a result, the homogeneous reactor became much more attractive since the critical size (neglecting external holdup) could then be reduced to about 30 tons of D2O with about 6 tons of uranium as an oxide in an unreflected sphere. This favorable development allowed emphasis to be shifted to less dense slurries, greatly simplifying the problems of maintaining a suspension of dense slurry, pumping it, and protecting against erosion.

Water reactors, all using slurry fuel but differing in that one was completely homogeneous, one was a light-water-cooled heterogeneous arrangement, and another was a D2O-cooled heterogeneous reactor. These reactors were proposed for operation at power levels of 500 MW or more (depending on external power-removal systems) and were intended as alternates to the Hanford piles for plutonium production in case satisfactory operation of the graphite-natural uranium, water-cooled piles could not be achieved.

At this point, one might ask why homogeneous solution reactors were not given more serious consideration, especially in view of the newly discovered cross section for deuterium, which permitted considerably lower concentrations of uranium. The answer is that the only known soluble salts of uranium which had a sufficiently low cross section to enable the design of a reactor of feasible size and D2O requirement were uranyl fluoride and uranium hexafluoride. (Enriched uranium was not then available). These were considered but rejected, principally because of corrosion and instability under radiation. A second factor was the evidence that D2O decomposition would be more severe in a solution reactor where fission fragments would be formed in intimate contact with the D2O rather than inside a solid particle as in the case of a slurry.

Research on homogeneous reactors was undertaken at Columbia University in May 1943 and continued with diminishing emphasis until the end of 1943; at which time most of the members of the homogeneous reactor group were transferred to Chicago, where they continued their work under the Metallurgical Laboratory.

At the Metallurgical Laboratory, the principal motivation for interest in homogeneous reactors was to develop alternate plutonium production facilities to be used in the event that the Hanford reactors did not operate successfully on a suitable large scale, and studies were continued through 1944. The results of this work are summarized in a book by Kirschenbaum.

The first homogeneous reactors and the Los Alamos program. During the summer of 1943, a group at Los Alamos, under the leadership of D. W.

There were two reasons for choosing UO2S8O instead of uranyl nitrate as the fuel: there is less neutron absorption in the sulfate than in the nitrate, and it was thought that the sulfate would be more soluble. The latter reason was considered important because it was feared that with the maximum enrichment material from the electromagnetic process, it might be difficult to dissolve the critical mass in the desired volume.

After gaining experience in operating the low-power reactor "LOPO," the Los Alamos group revised its plans for the higher power homogeneous reactor known as the "HYPO. " After extensive modification of the design, the reactor was built and put into operation in December 1944 with uranyl nitrate as the fuel.

In April 1949, extensive alterations were made to the HYPO reactor to make it a more useful and safer experimental tool. The modified reactor, known as "SUPO," is still in operation. The present SUPO model reached local boiling during initial tests due to the high power density. A slight increase in power density above the design level produces local boiling between cooling coils even though the average solution temperature does not exceed 85°C.

The work on water boilers at Los Alamos led to the design of power reactor versions as possible package power reactors for remote locations. In 1955, LAPRE-1 and -2 were fueled with solutions of enriched uranium oxide in concentrated phosphoric acid. The first experiment reached criticality in March 1956 and was operated at 20 kW for about 5 hr. At that time, radioactivity was noted in the steam system, and the reactor was shut down and dismantled. It was discovered that the gold plating on the stainless steel cooling coils had been damaged during assembly, and the phosphoric acid fuel solution had corroded through the stainless steel. The cooling coils were replaced, and operations were resumed in October 1956. However, similar corrosion difficulties were encountered, and it was decided to discontinue operations. In the meantime, work on LAPRE-2 continued, and construction of the reactor and its facilities was completed during the early part of 1958.

In August 1944, Coryell and Turkevich prepared a memorandum recommending the construction of a 50-kW homogeneous reactor containing 5 kg of uranium enriched to 123% U-235 or about 500 g of plutonium. The fuel proposed was to be in the form of a salt solution in ordinary water. The following valuable uses of such a reactor were listed in this memorandum and enlarged upon in a later memorandum by Coryell and Brown: 1. Radioisotope production, including the production of radioactive isotopes for medical purposes. 2. Production of neutrons for research on nuclear fission and fusion reactions. 3. Heating of materials to high temperatures for industrial processes such as metallurgy or chemical synthesis. 4. Generation of electricity, either directly or through a steam turbine. 5. Propulsion of ships or aircraft by heat from the reactor.

The physicists were also interested in the homogeneous reactor, particularly as a research facility that would provide a high neutron flux for various experimental uses. The desirability of studying or demonstrating, if possible, the process of breeding had been made especially attractive by recent data indicating that U-33 emitted more neutrons for each one absorbed than either U-5 or Pu-39, and the physicists were quick to point out the possibility of establishing a U%-thorium breeding cycle which would create more U-3 from the thorium than was consumed in the Enriched Pile (ORNL-CF-44-11-236).

The power output of such a breeder with a three-year doubling time is about 10,000 kW. This became the new goal for the homogeneous reactor. The reactor was conceived as a prototype homogeneous reactor and thermal breeder. In addition, it was conceived as an all-purpose experimental tool with a neutron flux higher than any other.

Basic problems that had not been solved. Perhaps the most serious of these was the formation of bubbles in the homogeneous solution. These bubbles appear as a result of the decomposition of water into hydrogen and oxygen by fission fragments and other energetic particles. Because the bubbles cause fluctuations in the density of the fuel solution, they make it difficult to control the operating level of the reactor. Nuclear physics calculations made at the time indicated that under certain conditions, it might be possible to set up a power oscillation which, instead of being damped, would get larger with each cycle until the reactor went completely out of control. Minimizing the bubble problem by operating at elevated temperature and pressure was not considered seriously for two reasons: first, beryllium, aluminum, and lead were the only possible tank materials then known to have sufficiently low neutron-absorption characteristics to be useful in a breeder reactor. Of these metals, only lead was acceptable because of corrosion, and lead is not strong enough to sustain elevated temperatures and high pressures. Second, there had been essentially no previous experience in handling highly radioactive materials under pressure, and consequently, the idea of constructing a completely new type of reactor to operate under high pressure was not considered attractive.

Other major unsolved problems at the end of 1945 were those of corrosion, solution stability, and large external holdup of fissionable material. Because it appeared that the solution of these problems would require extensive research and development at higher neutron fluxes than were hoped, a decision was made to focus on the homogeneous reactor problems. The extensive effort on this latter reactor (later built as the Materials Testing Reactor in Idaho) forced a temporary cessation of design and development activities related to homogeneous breeder reactors, although basic research on aqueous uranium systems continued.

1-1. 5 The Oak Ridge National Laboratory's Homogeneous Reactor Program proposed that the overall situation with respect to homogeneous reactors be reviewed and their feasibility re-evaluated in light of knowledge and experience gained since the end of 1945. Dr. Weinberg informally suggested to a few chemists, physicists, and engineers that they reconsider the prospects for homogeneous reactors and hold a series of meetings to discuss their findings.

Brighter than in 1945, and that effort directed toward the design of a small experimental reactor should be resumed. By July 1949, interest in homogeneous reactors had increased further as a result of the preliminary studies. Physics and design studies were undertaken on a somewhat expanded scale. By the latter part of August 1949, a preliminary design of the major components had been developed.

Construction of the reactor (Homogeneous Reactor Experiment No. 1) was started in September 1950 and completed in January 1952. After a period of non-nuclear testing with a natural-uranium fuel solution, HRE-1 reached criticality on April 15, 1952. Early in 1954, it was dismantled after successfully demonstrating the nuclear and chemical stability of a moderately high-power-density circulating-fuel reactor fueled with a solution of enriched uranyl sulfate.

During the period of construction and operation of HRE-1, conceptual design studies were completed for a boiling reactor experiment (BRE) operating at 150 kW of heat and a 58-MW (heat) intermediate-scale homogeneous reactor (ISHR). Further work on these reactors was deferred late in 1953; however, when it became evident from HRE-1 and the associated development program that construction of a second homogeneous reactor experiment would be a more suitable course of action.

The main reason for this decision was that HRE-1 did not demonstrate all the engineering features of a homogeneous reactor required for continuous operation of a nuclear power plant. Construction of the reactor was completed late in 1956 and was followed by a period of nonnuclear operation to determine the engineering characteristics of the reactor. This testing program was interrupted for six to nine months by the need for replacing flanges and leak detection tubing in which small cracks had developed, owing to stress corrosion induced by chloride contamination of the tubing. The reactor was brought to criticality on December 27, 1957, and reached full power operation at 5 MW on April 4, 1958. Shortly thereafter, a crack in the core tank developed which permitted fuel solution to leak into the D2O blanket.

1. 1. 6 Industrial participation in homogeneous reactor development. The opinion of some who compared homogeneous breeder reactors with solid-fuel converters is reflected in the following excerpts from Ref. 19: The two reactor types that offer the greatest possibilities for economic production of central station power are the thermal U3 breeders of the circulating fuel type and fast plutonium. The self-regulating features of fluid-fuel reactors and low fission-product inventory due to continuous chemical processing give these reactors the 2. 1. 2 Homogeneous reactor concept. The advantage of this type of reactor is that it can achieve high power densities and have a large negative reactivity coefficient, which makes it inherently safe. 3. 1. The fuel is typically composed of a mixture of uranium and plutonium, which undergoes a series of fission and capture reactions to produce heat.

4. 1. 5 Homogeneous reactor safety features. One of the key advantages of homogeneous reactors is their inherent safety features. The self-regulating nature of the fuel cycle means that the reaction rate is controlled by the concentration of fissile material in the core, which acts as a negative feedback mechanism to prevent overheating or other accidents. 5. 1. However, there are still significant technical challenges that must be overcome before these reactors can become commercially viable, including the need for advanced materials and fuel cycles, improved safety features, and reduced costs.

During late 1954 and early 1955, Westinghouse and Pennsylvania Power and Light Company, operating under study agreements with the Atomic Energy Commission, made a joint study aimed at determining the economic feasibility of aqueous homogeneous-type reactor plants. The study indicated that a two-region solution-slurry plant and a single-region slurry plant appeared to have excellent long-range possibilities for producing competitive electric power. The study also indicated, however, that considerable development work would be required before the technical feasibility of either type of plant could be determined with any degree of certainty. The results of this and other continuing studies led the two companies to set up the Pennsylvania Advanced Reactor Project in August 1955. An initial proposal to build a 150-MW (electric) power plant was submitted to the Atomic Energy Commission in April 1956, and on May 24, 1957, the Commission authorized Westinghouse and Pennsylvania Power and Light Company to proceed with construction of the plant. The plant, which was designed to use uranium-235 as fuel, would consist of two reactors each rated at 75 MW (electric) and would be located near Shipping port on the Ohio River about 40 miles upstream from Pittsburgh.

In spite of the formidable development program, which appeared to be associated with the construction of a full-scale homogeneous reactor power plant, a second industrial group proposed building a homogeneous reactor as part of the power demonstration program in cooperation with the government. This proposal (made in response to a request by the Atomic Energy Commission for small-scale reactors) by the Foster Wheeler and Worthington Corporations in January 1956 considered construction of an aqueous homogeneous burner reactor. Plans were for a reactor and associated oil-fired super-heater with a net electrical capacity of 10,000 kW for the Wolverine Electric Cooperative, Hersey, Michigan. Although this proposal was accepted in principle by the Atomic Energy Commission in April 1956, and money was appropriated by Congress for carrying out the project, in May 1958, the Atomic Energy Commission announced that plans had been canceled due to increases in the estimated cost of the plant.

The second proposal submitted to the Atomic Energy Commission jointly by the Pennsylvania Power and Light Company and Westinghouse Electric Corporation was determined by the Commission on February 26, 1958, as acceptable as a basis for negotiation of a contract but was later recalled following a review by the Joint Congressional Committee on Atomic Energy. The proposal called for the construction of a reactor to be operated on the Pennsylvania Power and Light Company system. The reactor would use a thorium-uranium fuel as a slurry in heavy water.

Cost of research and development planned for 1958 and 1959, at which time a decision would be made either to begin actual construction of a plant or terminate the project. The cost of the project, scheduled for completion by December 1963, was estimated at $108 million. The Westinghouse and Pennsylvania Power and Light Company's share of the cost included $5. 5 million for research since 1955, $57 million for plant construction, and $16 million for excess operating costs during the first five years of operation.

Types of systems and their applications. Because of the large number of possible combinations of mechanical systems and compounds of uranium and thorium which may be dissolved or dispersed in H2O or D2O, there exists in principle an entire spectrum of aqueous homogeneous reactors. These may be classified according to (a) the type of fissionable material burned and produced (U-235 burners, converters, breeders), (b) the geometry or disposition of the fuel and fertile material (one-region, two-region), or (c) the method of heat removal (boiling, circulating fuel, and fluidized suspension reactors). The possible materials which can be used in these various reactor types are given in Table 1-2. Applications of homogeneous reactors. Homogeneous reactors have been studied for a variety of applications including (a) nuclear power generation, (b) production of radioisotopes and other special materials, (c) heat sources for industrial processes, and (d) research in the basic physics and chemistry of nuclear reactions.

The terms used in classifying homogeneous reactors may be defined as follows: Burner reactors are those in which fissionable fuel is consumed but virtually no new fuel is generated. To this class belong the water boilers, homogeneous research reactors, U235 burners, and LAPRE-type reactors. Converter reactors produce a different fissionable fuel than is destroyed in the fission process, such as in the dual-purpose plutonium producers or single-region converters, while breeder reactors produce the same fissionable fuel as that which is consumed. One-region reactors contain a homogeneous mixture of fissionable and fertile materials in a moderator. Generally, these have large reactor diameters, in order to minimize neutron losses, and contain fuel plus fertile material in concentrations of 100 to 300 g of uranium or thorium per liter of solution or slurry. Two-region reactors are characterized by a core containing fissionable materials in the moderator surrounded by a blanket of fertile material in moderator. Boiling reactors are reactors in which boiling takes place in the core and/or blanket, and heat is removed by separating the steam from the solution or suspension.

Advantages and disadvantages of aqueous fuel systems. Aqueous fuel systems possess certain advantages which make them particularly attractive for numerous nuclear-reactor applications ranging from small reactors (for mobile units or package-power plants) to large, high-power reactors (for large-scale production of plutonium, U83, and/or power). A homogeneous reactor is one in which the fuel and moderator are present in a single phase, usually aqueous solution.

These excited or fissioned nuclei then release additional neutrons, which can cause further fissions in other fuel and moderator atoms. This process is self-sustaining if the rate of neutron absorption by the fuel and moderator is balanced by the rate of neutron production, resulting in a chain reaction. The design of a homogeneous reactor must take into account several factors that influence its performance and safety. In addition, the reactor must be designed to withstand various operating conditions such as power fluctuations, temperature changes, and loss-of-coolant accidents. The study of homogeneous reactors has been conducted both experimentally and theoretically since the early days of nuclear energy research.

However, many apparently formidable practical problems are associated with the continued operation and maintenance of systems involving radioactive fuel solutions. It is believed, therefore, that extensive experience in a series of small- to large-scale reactor installations will be required to demonstrate the reliability of aqueous homogeneous reactors, which will necessitate a long-range development program. In addition, the choice of water as the fuel-bearing medium limits both the fuel concentration and operating temperature to values which may be less than optimum for the production of power and fissionable material.

High power density. Because of the homogeneous nature of the reactor fuel-fluid, virtually no heat transfer barrier exists between the fuel and coolant. Thus, reactor power densities of 50 to 200 kW/liter may be possible, being limited by considerations other than heat transfer, such as radiation-induced corrosion and chemical reactions.

High burnup of fuel in heterogeneous reactors is limited by radiation damage to fuel elements or loss of reactivity. However, in liquid-fuel reactors, continual removal of poisons is possible, as well as continual additions of new fuel, thereby permitting unlimited burnup.

High neutron economy is improved by eliminating absorption of neutrons by cladding and structural material within the reactor core. Also, there is the possibility of continuously removing Xe135 and other fission-product poisons. In addition, an aqueous fuel system lends itself readily to a spherical core geometry, which minimizes self-regulation. The reactivity feedback mechanisms in a liquid metal reactor are very strong due to the high thermal conductivity of the coolant and the large negative temperature coefficient of reactivity of the fuel. This means that the reactor can be designed with a very small positive reactivity insertion rate, which reduces the likelihood of power excursions or accidents caused by operator error or equipment malfunction. Fuel cycle flexibility. The use of aqueous fuels in a liquid metal cooled reactor allows for greater flexibility in fuel cycle options compared to solid-fueled reactors. Safety features. The use of liquid metal coolant provides several safety advantages over other types of coolants. Liquid metals have very low vapor pressures, which means that they are less likely to boil off during accidents or loss-of-coolant events.

In addition, the high thermal conductivity of liquid metals allows for larger diameter pipes and more efficient heat transfer, which reduces the risk of overheating in the event of a coolant flow stoppage. Proliferation resistance. For example, the use of aqueous fuels makes it more difficult to separate and reuse plutonium from spent fuel, which is a concern for nuclear weapons proliferation.

Simple control system. Density changes in the moderator create a sensitive, negative temperature coefficient of reactivity, which makes this system self-stabilizing. This eliminates the need for mechanically driven regulating rods. In addition, shim control can be achieved by changing the position of the fuel elements within the core.

External circulation of fuel solution: Removal of heat from the reactor core by circulating fuel solution rather than coolant only through external heat exchangers increases the total amount of fuel in the system and greatly complicates problems of containment of radioactivity and accountability of fissionable material. The release of delayed neutrons in the fuel solution outside of the reactor core reduces the neutron economy of the reactor and causes induced radioactivity in external equipment, resulting in the need for remote maintenance.

Nuclear safety. The safety of homogeneous reactors is associated with the negative density coefficient of reactivity in such systems; however, by virtue of this coefficient, relatively large reactivity additions are possible through heat exchanger mishaps and abrupt changes in fuel circulation rate. In boiling reactors, changes in the volume of vapor within the reactor core may lead to excessive reactivity changes.

Limited uranium concentration. In H2O-moderated reactors, in particular, a high uranium or thorium concentration is necessary for a high conversion ratio. Concentrations up to 1000 g/liter, however, may be considered for solutions and up to 4000 g/liter for fluidized beds.

Limited operating temperatures: At present, the operating temperature range for aqueous solution systems appears limited due to corrosion problems at around 225°C and phase stability issues above 300°C. Higher pressure conditions encountered at these temperatures are also problematic.

Explosive decomposition product. Radiation-induced decomposition of the moderator can produce an explosive mixture of hydrogen and oxygen in the reactor system. This hazard means that special precautionary design measures must be taken. To prevent excessive gas formation and reduce the requirement for large recombiners, a recombination catalyst such as cupric ion may be added.

Dilute solution systems and their applications. One-region reactors fueled with a dilute solution of highly enriched uranium or "burner reactors" are ideal as a concentrated source of neutrons, since the critical mass and size of the core of this type of reactor can be very small. Many low-power research reactors are in operation which use this fuel system, and very-high-flux research reactors of this type are being considered. The principal advantages of solution reactors for this latter application are the small amount of U5 required for criticality and the ability to add.

One-region burner reactors are applicable for both small- and large-scale nuclear power plants. Such plants can operate for very long periods of time (20 years or more) without the necessity for the removal of all the fission products. Corrosion product buildup, however, must be limited to prevent uranium precipitation. The fuel concentration would be dilute, increasing with the time of reactor operation if no fuel processing is carried out. An advantage of these systems is that they utilize fuel in the concentration range which has been studied most extensively. Experience in circulating such solutions indicates that careful control of operating conditions and the concentrations of the various fuel constituents, such as two-phase separation, uranium hydrolysis, and oxygen-depletion precipitation of uranium, is necessary.

1-3. 2 High-temperature systems. Fuel systems of enriched uranium dissolved in highly concentrated phosphoric acid have been suggested for homogeneous power reactors because of the high thermal stability and low vapor pressure of such systems. This permits operation at higher temperatures than is possible with dilute acids, with accompanying higher thermal efficiencies. Fuel systems of this type include UO3 in 30 to 60 w/o (weight percent) phosphoric acid.

The UO2 in 70 to 90 w/o phosphoric acid, UO2 in 90 to 100 w/o phosphoric acid, and UOs in concentrated chromic acid. The UO3-H3PO4 system used in the Los Alamos reprocessing plant has a phosphate-to-uranium ratio of 4/1 to 10/1 and is stable up to 450°C. However, the neutron economy is poor, and these solutions are corrosive to all metals except platinum and gold. The UO2-H3PO4 systems, pressurized with hydrogen, have somewhat better corrosion characteristics, and copper may be used, at least in regions which are kept below 250°C.

1-4. 1 Purpose of converters. In converter reactors, U is burned to produce U33 or Pu89 by absorption of excess neutrons in fertile material. Thus, the purpose of converter reactors is the production of power, fissionable material, or both. Such reactors are also considered mainly in connection with the U35-U38Pu239 fuel cycle, whereas the homogeneous breeder reactors are associated with the thorium fuel cycle.

1-4. 2 One-region converters. The principal advantage of the solution-type converter for plutonium production is the insolubility of plutonium in the high-temperature uranium sulfate system (see Chapter 6). This opens the possibility of separating the plutonium by centrifugation rather than by a solvent extraction or absorption process. The costs of this method of recovering the plutonium, which contains only small amounts of Pu, should be considerably less than is possible with solid-fuel reactors and conventional processing techniques. Indications are, however, that the plutonium formed in the fuel solution is preferentially adsorbed on hot metal surfaces in contact with the solution and is difficult to remove (see Chapter 6).

Necessary to contain these solutions, which will lead to considerably higher equipment and piping costs. The addition of lithium sulfate to the solution would reduce corrosion and raise the phase-separation temperature so that it might be possible to use stainless steel but the neutron economy with normal lithium is poorer, and separated Li would be costly.

A single-region converter fueled with natural or slightly enriched uranium oxide as a suspension avoids the problems of plutonium precipitation, phase separation, and corrosion mentioned above. The advantage of such a converter reactor for power production is the elimination of radiation damage and fuel burnup problems encountered with solid-fuel elements; however, the problem of radiation damage to the reactor pressure vessel must be considered.

1-4. 3 Two-region converters. Two-region homogeneous converters may also be fueled with either D2O solutions or slurries in these reactors; however, the U2 is in the core, and the fertile material is in the blanket. A two-region converter with a dilute enriched-uranium core solution and a concentrated depleted-uranium blanket solution shows promise of producing more economical power and plutonium than the one-region converter reactors mentioned previously, because of the lower inventory charges and the better neutron economy. Although the power density at the wall of the titanium-lined pressure vessel is lower in the case of the two-region machine, which minimizes the possibility of accelerated corrosion rates, there is some evidence that titanium corrosion will not be severe in any case. The major materials problem in the dilute-solution core converter will be that of zirconium corrosion, which may be above 30 mils/year at power densities necessary for economic production of power and fissionable material.

Two-region converters fueled with a uranium oxide slurry in the core may be a possibility as an alternative to the solution-slurry system, but not much is known about the corrosion resistance of zirconium in contact with fissioning uranium oxide or about the engineering behavior of such a slurry.

1-5. 1 The importance of breeding. If present projections for the growth of the nuclear power industry in the United States are correct, the installed capacity of nuclear electric plants in 1980 may be as much as 227 million kilowatts and may be increasing by 37 million kilowatts annually. Even assuming optimistic figures for fuel burned in then-existing plants and fuel plus fertile material for inventories in new plants, 2-5. 1 the need for breeding becomes apparent. The nuclear power industry will require a significant amount of new fuel to keep pace with its projected growth, and this fuel must be available at a reasonable cost. 3-5. 1 In addition, the breeding of fissile material from fertile materials has important implications for the long-term availability of nuclear fuels. 4-5.

The annual requirement for fissionable material will be approximately 25,000 tons of uranium and 8,000 tons of thorium, respectively.

Although such a conversion will not reduce the inventory requirement of fuel and fertile material for new plants starting up, this amounts to only about 25% of the burnup requirement. On this basis, the goal of the nuclear industry should be to develop reactor designs and associated fuel systems which achieve a consumption of at least 5% to 10% of the total fertile material, as well as the initial fissionable material. This corresponds to a total burnup of about 50,000 Mwd/ton. Although such a fuel consumption might be obtained in high-neutron-economy converter reactors through recycling of the fuel, it seems likely that even the best such reactor may fall short of this goal and that both fast and thermal breeders will be needed.

In the long term, therefore, the development of breeding systems is essential. In the short term, where emphasis is on fuel costs rather than on neutron economy and fertile material utilization, converters rather than breeders may dominate.

One-region thorium breeders. Since U-235 does not occur in nature, homogeneous thorium breeder reactors will probably start out as converters, with U-235 as the fuel and thorium as the fertile material. One-region reactors of this type utilize a suspension of 100 to 300 g per liter of thorium oxide plus enriched U-5 as oxide and D2O as the moderator. In order to maintain a breeding ratio greater than 1, fuel processing is necessary to remove fission-product poisons. Also, to reduce losses due to neutron leakage, the diameter of the reactor should be at least 12 ft.

1-5. 3 Two-region breeder reactors. Use of a solution-type core permits the continuous removal of insoluble fission-product poisons by means of hydroclones, while a slurry-type core leads to higher breeding ratios. Because of these compensating factors, estimated fuel costs are 2-5. 4 Two-region reactors with liquid-metal cooling. 3-5. 5 Two-region reactors with gas cooling. 4-5.

Approximately the same in both types of reactors. While the use of a suspension in the core may minimize the problem of radiation-induced corrosion of the zirconium, not much is yet known about the behavior of zirconium in a thorium-uranium slurry-fueled reactor. Calculations summarized in Chapter 10 show that both solution and slurry-fueled two-region breeders have higher breeding ratios and lower fuel costs than one-region breeders.

Focused on the possibility of removing heat from a homogeneous reactor by boiling rather than by circulating the fuel solution, the research recognized the advantages of a boiling reactor. These include: (a) more rapid response to sudden reactivity increases, minimizing power excursions; (b) elimination of fuel circulating pumps; (c) an increase in the temperature of steam delivered to the turbine for a given reactor operating pressure; and (d) the reduction or elimination of problems of corrosion and induced radioactivity associated with the circulation of fuel and fertile material through an external heat-removal system. However, at that time, questions regarding the nuclear stability of a boiling, liquid-fuel reactor and the maximum specific power in terms of kilowatts per liter that could be extracted from a given size core remained unanswered.

Experiments on bulk boiling at atmospheric pressures in a 1-ft-diameter cylindrical tank indicated that power densities up to 5 kW/liter might be achieved. It soon became apparent, however, that high-pressure power density measurements would be required, and the design of a boiling reactor experiment (BRE) called the “Teapot” was initiated. To answer the question of the nuclear stability of such a reactor, a combined group from under boiling conditions in October 1951. The reactor was operated at a total power of 6 kW and solution power densities of 0.

This removed one of the important obstacles to the construction of an experimental boiling reactor, and in January 1952, the Oak Ridge National Laboratory began construction of a boiling water reactor. The proposed reactor was to operate at a power level of 250 kW of heat and pressures up to 150 psi. The reactor was designed to investigate the operating characteristics of boiling reactors.

The actor was estimated to cost approximately $300,000, including the building to house it. A one-year effort involving nuclear and engineering calculations, completion of the BRE conceptual design, and experiments on bubble nucleation in the presence of radiation resulted from the proposal. In January 1953, however, the problem of maintaining sufficient oxidizing conditions to prevent reduction and precipitation of the uranium in a boiling uranyl sulfate solution became apparent, and construction of the reactor was deferred pending the outcome of solution-stability experiments. These experiments, completed in October 1953, indicated that at oxygen concentrations likely to be encountered in a boiling reactor (6 to 7 ppm), reduction of the uranium would occur in solutions in contact with stainless steel. Since the metallurgy of titanium or zirconium was not sufficiently advanced to construct a reactor using these alternate metals, it was decided to abandon the BRE itself and continue experimental work on the problems of solution stability, steam separation, and power densities at high pressure. Work on steam separators and experimental measurements of the movement of air and steam through heated solutions at high pressures were carried out under contract by the Babcock & Wilcox Company.

These results and theoretical calculations of the power removal from boiling reactors provide a basis for estimating the obtainable power density of such reactors under varying core heights, operating pressures, and moderator density decreases. Values range from 10 to 40 kW/liter with an average of 18. 5 kW/liter for a 15-ft-high core, operating at 2000 psi, and a density decrease due to steam of 0. 4. Although the effect of such a void fraction on nuclear stability is not known, if tolerable, boiling reactors may be able to achieve average power densities comparable to those estimated for large-scale nonboiling circulating-fuel reactors operating under a similar pressure. In this latter case, the holdup of solution in the external circulating system lowers the power density of the core only, to an average of about 10 to 20 kW/liter. The two systems are comparable, therefore, in terms of obtainable power densities, and boiling reactors cannot be excluded on this basis.

The various applications of boiling as a method of heat removal from homogeneous reactors include a one-region boiling solution or slurry reactor; a two-region reactor with a nonboiling core and a boiling blanket; and a two-region reactor with a boiling core and a boiling blanket. The problem of maintaining a sufficiently oxidizing solution in a boiling uranyl sulfate-D2O reactor, although serious in a stainless-steel system, can be eliminated if all surfaces in contact with the solution are made of titanium, and oxygen is supplied continuously.

Per liter have been successfully boiled at 325°C in a titanium-lined pipe. Experiments have not yet been carried out with higher uranium concentrations in titanium. Continued interest in boiling homogeneous reactors has led to a number of studies of large-scale reactors of this type. The actual construction of a boiling slurry reactor is underway in the USSR.

Use of boiling as a method for removal of power from the ThOs slurry blanket of large two-region homogeneous reactors appears to present no major difficulties. The apparent advantages are that no circulating pump would be required to handle the slurry, containment of the highly active slurry in the reactor vessel, and the possibility of operating the blanket at the core pressure and using the blanket power for heating the secondary steam. One major problem is that of keeping the slurry suspended.

1-6. 2 Gaseous homogeneous reactors. The existence of UF6, which has a low parasitic capture cross-section and is a gas at ordinary temperatures, at atmospheric pressure and has a critical temperature of 252°C at 720 psi. Although UF6 is corrosive to most metals, it can be contained in nickel and monel. However, the effect of radiation on the integrity of the protective film has not been studied. Considerable experience has been gained in the handling of UF.

Pure UF6 is not a practical possibility for a gaseous homogeneous reactor because fluorine is not a good enough moderator. Addition of helium makes such a reactor possible, and calculations by D. E. Hull in a report, “Possible Application of UF in Piles," show that the critical mass of a graphite-reflected, He + UF6 reactor is 84 kg of U235. About 15 tons of helium in a 60-ft-diameter core would be required.

Mixed UF$^3$ gas and dispersions of solid moderators such as beryllium or graphite have been suggested, as well as beds of moderator particles fluidized with circulating UF$^4$ [55]. However, these proposals have no apparent advantages compared with gas- or liquid-cooled fluidized systems described in the following section.

1-6. 3 Fluidized systems. A variant of the fixed-bed or solid-moderator homogeneous reactors consists of subdividing the fuel and/or moderator to the point where the particles can be fluidized by the flowing gas or liquid. Gas-cooled reactors of this type have received considerable attention because of the higher heat-transfer rates obtainable compared with fixed-bed reactors. A number of studies of gas-fluidized reactors have been [57, 58] and by other groups [59, 60].

In an Oak Ridge study, various types of fluidized-bed reactors were compared. Systems investigated were (a) a sodium-cooled fast reactor, (b) a gas-cooled system, (c) an organic-moderated reactor, (d) a heavy-water-moderated reactor, and (e) a light-water system. A detailed study of this latter system was carried out to compare its characteristics and performance with solid-fuel heterogeneous pressurized-water reactors. The results indicated that both the light-water-moderated and organic-moderated fluidized reactors showed promise, while the gas-cooled, the D2O-cooled, and the fast (unmoderated) reactors were found to be less satisfactory for application of the fluidized-bed technique.

Calculations show that a typical, one-region, 400 thermal Mw reactor having a core diameter of 15 ft and a temperature rise of 50°C would require particles in the 40- to 60-micron range, whereas a two-region reactor with a liquid-fluidized blanket would require particles in the 200- to 600-micron range, and if the particles were confined to a 6-in.

ThOS and ThOS + 0. 5% CaO cylinders (cylinders prepared by calcination at temperatures of both 1650 and 1800°C), fluidized in water, gave toroids at superficial velocities up to 26 ft/sec, and water temperatures of 250°C showed essentially no attrition for periods up to 200 hr.

Nuclear characteristics refer to the conditions and material concentrations under which reactor systems will remain critical, the relative changes in concentration of materials within the system as a function of reactor operation, and the time behavior of variables in the reactor system which occur when deviations from criticality take place. The material concentrations are closely connected with fuel costs in power reactors, while reactor behavior under noncritical conditions is closely related to the safety and control of the reactor system. These nuclear characteristics are determined from the results obtained from so-called “reactor criticality" and "reactor kinetic calculations. " In such studies, certain parameter values pertaining to nuclei concentrations and reaction probabilities are used for convenience; some of these are listed in Section 2-2.

The statistics of chain reactions in aqueous-homogeneous reactors are of interest primarily in connection with the estimation of the inventory of fuel and fertile material, power density at the wall, the flux distribution inside the reactor, and the rate of production of fissionable isotopes. These enter into economic calculations pertaining to fuel costs in power reactors and also into criteria specifying the design of the system. The most important factors determining criticality are geometry nature, concentration, and enrichment of the fuel nature and distribution of other components in the reactor and operating temperature and pressure. The production of fissionable isotopes depends primarily on the neutron economy of the system and will be a function of the relative competition for neutrons between the fertile material and the various other absorbers. The latter include materials of construction, moderator, fuel components, fission products, and various nonfissionable nuclei formed by parasitic neutron capture in the fuel.

Although criticality is assumed at all times, the concentration of fuel isotopes can change appreciably with time owing to the relative competition between isotope formation, decay, and neutron absorption processes. In many studies, it has been assumed that the reactor has operated for such times that the steady-state conditions apply with regard to the nuclei concentrations. This simplifies the isotope equations but may not always give an adequate picture of the actual concentrations that would be present in an operating reactor.

2-1. 1 Calculation methods. Since both light and heavy water are excellent moderators, the energy of fission neutrons is rapidly degraded, with the result that most of the fissions are produced by thermal neutrons. Under these conditions, either the modified one-group or the two-group diffusion equations are usually applicable for criticality calculations. For simplicity, this discussion will be limited to spherical reactors.

The two-group diffusion equations were used for two-region reactor calculations. The effect of a thin shell between the two regions on reactor criticality and breeding ratio was considered by accounting for the shell absorptions through a boundary condition. The impact of a pressure vessel wall was addressed by utilizing an "effective extrapolation distance" to specify the radius where the flux was assumed to be zero.

The boundary conditions used assume that the fast flux has the same value on the core side of the core-tank wall as on the blanket side, and the same is also true of the slow flux. At the core-tank wall, the net fast-neutron current on the blanket side is assumed equal to that on the core side, while the net slow-neutron current on the core side is assumed equal to the flux rate of neutron absorptions in the core tank plus the net slow-neutron current on the blanket side.

In neutron energy. Boundary conditions analogous to those specified above would apply. Such a formulation assumes that neutrons in the ith group are always slowed down into the (i+ 1)th group, corresponding to a relatively small number of fast groups. Using about 30 groups or more, multigroup methods used in homogeneous reactor calculations consider that fast neutrons are born in the various fast groups in accordance with the fraction of fission neutrons generated in the particular group. For all materials but hydrogen, neutrons are “slowed down" from one energy group to the group immediately below, and with hydrogen, the possibility exists for a neutron to pass from one group to any group below as a result of one scattering collision. Other multigroup methods of calculation have been devised, which consider that a scattering collision degrades a neutron into the groups below in accordance with the probability for degradation into a particular group.

Comparison of the above results with those obtained using a two-group model shows that if 7. 5/Nin is equal to 1, the breeding ratio obtained by the two methods is about the same; however, the critical concentration is about 30% higher when the two-group model is used. Under these conditions, the two-group model should be adequate for obtaining the breeding ratio and conservative with respect to estimating the critical concentration.

Have also been obtained using multi-group calculations, which indicate that the two-group method is valid so long as the value of fuel is independent (or nearly so) of energy, or so long as nearly all the fissions are due to absorption of thermal neutrons.

To compare results obtained by different calculational methods, breeding ratios and critical fuel concentrations were obtained for some two-region, D2O-moderated thorium-blanket breeder reactors using a multigroup, multiregion Univac program (Eyewash) and a two-group, two-region Oracle program. In these calculations, operation at 280°C was assumed; a 3-in. -thick Zircaloy-2 core tank separated the core from the blanket, and a 6-in. -thick iron pressure vessel contained the reactor. Absorptions occurred only in U33 and thorium in the core and in thorium in the blanket. The two-group parameters were computed from the multigroup cross sections by numerical integration. In the two-group, two-region calculations, a "thin-shell approximation" was used to estimate core-tank absorptions, while the effect of the pressure vessel was simulated by adding an extrapolation distance to the blanket.

In the multigroup studies, various values for η in the resonance region were considered. In one case, the value of 723 was assumed to be constant and equal to the thermal value. 95.

The initial breeding ratios and U2 critical concentrations obtained from the Eyewash and two-group, two-region calculations are given in Table 5 for slurry-core reactors (zero core thorium concentration also corresponds to a solution-core reactor). With solution-core reactors, the effect of the value of 773 upon breeding ratio was less pronounced than for slurry-core reactors, since fewer resonance absorptions take place with the lower fuel concentrations.

As indicated in -5, the breeding ratio is rather dependent upon the value of 723. For these reactors, relatively more fissions take place in the resonance-energy region as the core loading is increased, owing to the “hardening of the neutron spectrum. " Figure 2-5 also shows that the two-group model gives breeding ratios which are in good agreement with those obtained from the multigroup model, so long as 723 does not deviate significantly from about 0. 95. The results given by curve "a" in -5 are based effectively on such a value of 723/n22 and indicate that two-group results are valid.

In general, for the cases studied, it was found that for a heavily loaded blanket (or core), the two-group values of total neutron leakage were larger than the total leakages obtained from the multigroup calculation. The multigroup model allowed for competition between fast absorptions in fuel and fast leakage, while the two-group model assumed that fast leakage occurred before any resonance absorption occurred. The multigroup results were also used to calculate the fast effect, €, previously defined in Eq. (2-2). It was found that resonance fissions accounted for 10% to 40% of the total fissions in those reactors containing from 0 to 300 g Th/liter in the core region.

If the reactor core size is small, the two-group method does not adequately treat leakage of fast neutrons. For this case, two-group results may be significantly different from those obtained using a multi-group diffusion code that includes all three neutron energy groups. The thermal value for 723 was assumed to be equal to 2. 30 instead of 2. 25 used in more recent calculations; the 2. 25 value is believed to be more accurate.

Not be adequate even though 7 is equal to 74. This is indicated by the experimental [14] and calculated results for the HRE-2 given in -15. As illustrated, there is excellent agreement between the experimental data and the data calculated by a multigroup method and by a “harmonics method," but not with the results from the two-group model. The harmonics calculation [15] referred to in -15 does not take into account fast fissions but does treat the slowing-down of neutrons in a more realistic manner than does the two-group calculation. The multigroup result [16] indicated that about 13% of the fissions were due to neutrons having energies above thermal.

In obtaining the nuclear characteristics of reactors, it is necessary to know the probabilities with which different events occur. These reaction probabilities are usually given on an atomic basis in terms of cross sections. This has been done to a limited extent in this section. Listed here are some nuclear data and physical properties of uranium isotopes, uranyl sulfate, heavy water, thorium oxide, and Zircaloy-2 used in two-group calculations for thorium breeder reactors.

Estimates of the effective cross section in typical homogeneous reactor neutron spectra, except for the 2200 m/s value, include contributions due to resonance absorptions. Although these values were not used in the calculations presented, they are believed to be more accurate than the ones employed.

2-2. 1 Nuclear data. Table 2-1 lists thermal microscopic absorption and fission cross sections for various elements and for various temperatures. All cross sections listed under the columns headed by °C have been corrected for a Maxwell-Boltzmann flux distribution.

The relationships between breeding ratio and reactor-system inventory determine fuel costs in homogeneous reactors. The breeding ratio depends on neutron leakage as well as relative absorptions in fuel fertile material and other materials present, while material inventory is a function of reactor size and fuel and fertile-material concentrations. A range of parameter values must be considered to aid in understanding the above relationships. Based on results given in Section 1-1. 3, it appears that the two-group method gives satisfactory results for critical concentration and breeding ratio for most aqueous-homogeneous systems of interest. This permits survey-type calculations to be performed in a relatively short time interval. The results given below are based on the conventional two-group model.

In steady-state operation, the concentration of the various nuclides within the reactor system does not change with time. During the initial period of reactor operation, this situation is not true, but is approached after some time interval if neutron poisons are removed by fuel processing. The uranium isotope chain is normally cut off at U36 since this is a low-cross-section isotope, and neutrons lost to the successors of U236 would tend to be compensated for by fission neutrons generated in the fuel.

In uranium-plutonium reactors, steady-state rate material balances were made on U-235, U-236, U-238, Pu-239, Pu-240, and Pu-241. All other higher isotopes were assumed either to be removed in the fuel processing step or to have a negligible effect upon the nuclear characteristics of the reactor.

Although equilibrium results give the isotope ratios that would be approached in a reactor system, much of the desired nuclear information can be obtained by considering clean reactors; i. e. , reactors in which zero poisons exist, corresponding to initial conditions or to criticality conditions at reactor startup. This is a result of the rather simple relationships that exist between breeding ratio, critical concentration, and fraction poisons, and the ability to represent the higher isotopes by their fraction-poison equivalent.

2-3. 1 Two-region reactors. In order to estimate the minimum fuel costs in a two-region thorium breeder reactor, it is important to determine the relation between breeding ratio and the concentrations of fuel (U233) and fertile material (Th) in the core and blanket. Similar considerations apply to uranium-plutonium converter reactors. The breeding or conversion ratio will depend on neutron leakage as well as relative neutron absorptions in fuel, fertile material, and the core-tank wall; therefore, a range of core and pressure-vessel sizes must be considered.

Since fabrication problems and associated costs of pressure vessels capable of operating at 2000 psi increase rapidly for diameters above 12 ft, and since the effect of larger diameters on the nuclear characteristics of two-region reactors is relatively small, 12 ft has been taken as the limiting diameter value. Actually, in most calculations discussed here, the inside diameter of the pressure vessel has been held at 10 ft, and the core diameter allowed to vary in the range of 3 to 9 ft.

In addition to the limitation on the maximum diameter of the pressure vessel, there will also be a limitation, for a given total power output, on the minimum diameter of the core vessel. This minimum diameter is determined by the power density at the core wall since high power densities at the wall will lead to intolerable corrosion of the wall material (Zircaloy-2).

2-3. 2 Two-region thorium breeder reactors evaluated under initial conditions. The results given here are for reactors at startup. Although the trends indicated apply to reactors in steady-state operation, the values given here for the breeding ratio and fuel concentration would be somewhat different than those for steady-state conditions.

Calculations of breeding ratio, the power density at the inside core wall, and the maximum power density were carried out for some spherical reactors with 200 g Th/liter in the core. The blanket materials considered were heavy water (99. 75% D2O), beryllium, and ThO-heavy water suspensions. The inside diameter of the pressure vessel was fixed at 10 ft for one set of calculations and at 12 ft for a second set. Core diameters ranged from 6 to 9 ft in the first set and from 6 to 11 ft in the second set. The average temperature of all systems was taken as 280°C, and for the purpose of calculating power densities at the core wall, the total thermal power was taken as 100 MW. A 3-in-thick Zircaloy-2 core tank was assumed to separate the core and blanket in all reactors, and the value of 773 was taken as 2. 32. A more accurate value of 7° is presently considered to indicate that the breeding ratio increases for any core diameter by replacing either a D2O or Be blanket with one containing ThO. No significant increase in breeding ratio is obtained by increasing the blanket thorium concentration above 2 kg Th/liter. For reactors with fertile material in the blanket, the breeding ratio and wall power density increase with decreasing core diameter.

Additional results obtained on the same basis given above except that 73 was considered to be 2. 25, and that the U8 concentration in the blanket region was varied, are given in Figs. 2-7 through 2-9. Results were obtained for 10-ft-diameter pressure vessels and for core diameters of 6, 7, and 8 ft; the blanket thorium concentration was 500, 1000, or 300 g/liter. Generally, the results in Figs. 2-7 through 2-9 are complete for the 7-ft-diameter-core reactors, while for the 6- and 8-ft-diameter-core reactors results are shown only for the parameter-value extremes. The variation of results with parameter value is practically the same for all three core diameters, and so all the essential results are presented in the figures.

In all cases, slurries of D2O-ThO2-U308 are assumed in both the core and blanket regions, and all power densities are based on the assumption that the total reactor power is 100 thermal MW. Whenever the power density on the blanket side of the core-tank wall was greater than that on the core side (owing to a fuel concentration which was higher in the blanket than in the core), the greater value was plotted. This situation is indicated by the dashed lines in Figure 7.

Typical information obtained for these slurry reactors is given in Table 2-5 for two of the cases considered. The values of the breeding ratio for the two-region reactors given may be compared with those in Table 2-6 for a one-region reactor having the same size and the same diameter pressure vessel.

For all reactors having thorium concentrations of at least 100 g/liter in the core and 500 g/liter in the blanket, the neutron absorption by the core-tank wall was less than 1% of the total absorptions. 2-7 and 2-8 for reactors of 10-ft over-all diameter. The variations of critical concentration, fraction of total power generated in the blanket region, and the ratio of fuel to thorium required in the core for criticality are given in Table II for different thorium concentrations and blanket fuel concentrations. 10.

Effect of blanket U-33 concentration on breeding ratio and wall power density of two-region slurry reactors = 2. 25; total reactor power = 100 MW (heat); pressure vessel = 10 ft ID; core diameter = 7 ft; poison fraction = 0. A study on the effects of temperature and gas composition on the performance of a solid oxide fuel cell = 2.

The characteristics of the flat region of the appropriate curve indicated that small, uniform changes in core thorium concentration would have a negligible effect on reactor criticality. The position of the minimum in these curves did not significantly change with variations in blanket thickness, blanket thorium concentration, and blanket fuel concentration.

Effect of core thorium concentration on U-235 critical concentration, ratio of U-235 to Th required for criticality, and fraction of total power generated in blanket for some two-region slurry reactors. 723 = 2. 25; pressure vessel = 10 ft ID; poison fraction = 0; U-235 in blanket = 3 g/liter; temperature = 280°C. 723 = 2.

Concentration. The fraction of total power generated in the blanket increases nearly linearly with increasing blanket U concentration; increases with decreasing core diameter; and also increases with decreasing core and blanket thorium concentrations. Finally, the U3-to-thorium ratio required in the core for criticality passes through a minimum when the core thorium concentration is permitted to vary. These variations show that desirable features are always accompanied by some undesirable ones. Decreasing the core radius increases breeding ratio and possibly decreases inventory requirements but increases wall power density. These types of variations illustrate that minimum fuel costs will result only by compromise between various reactor features.

The breeding ratio, the power density at the core wall for a given total power, and the required fuel concentration have also been evaluated for cylindrical reactors.

Temperature 300°C, and the core diameter is either 4 or 6 ft. The Zircaloy-2 core tank was assumed to be 1/2 in. thick when the core diameter was 4 ft, and 2 in. The reactors were assumed to contain D2O, U8, and 6% fraction poisons in the core region and D2O, U33, and 1000 g Th/liter in the blanket region. Figure 2-10 gives the breeding ratio and the maximum power density at the core wall (core side) as a function of reactor length for different core radii and blanket fuel concentrations. The highest breeding ratios are associated with small core radii, thick blankets, and long reactors; however, these reactors also have relatively high power densities at the core wall.

In other studies of cylindrical reactors, results were obtained which indicated that breeding ratios for cylindrical reactors of interest were about the same as those obtained for spherical reactors. The required fuel concentrations were higher, as expected, so that the average flux was lower for the cylindrical geometry. Although the maximum core-wall power density decreased with increasing cylinder diameter, it was always higher than the wall power density obtained for the spherical reactors of equal volume. The results of these calculations are given in Table 2-7. These reactors were assumed to be at 280°C with 7% core poisons, 3 g of U233 per liter and 1000 g of Th per liter (as ThO2) in heavy water in the blanket, and operated at a total power of 60 MW. A cylindrical core was assumed to be positioned within a cylindrical pressure vessel such that a 2-ft blanket thickness surrounded the core.

The results given in Table 2-7 show that increasing the reactor height had only a slight effect on the breeding ratio; also, although the critical concentration declined with increasing height, the corresponding total fuel inventory increased. While not shown, the ratio of blanket power to core power did not vary significantly with reactor height. Increasing the core volume caused a pronounced decrease in core-wall power density and an increase in fuel inventory. Thus, for a 3-ft-diameter core, increasing the core length from 4. 8 to 8 ft decreased the power density by 36%. However, the blanket and core fuel inventory increased by about 40%.

2-3. 3 Nuclear characteristics of two-region thorium breeder reactors under equilibrium conditions. Results of some nuclear computations associated with the conceptual design of HRE-3 are given below for spherical two-region reactors in which the following conditions were assumed: 1. The fuel region consists of 60% enriched uranium oxide (UO2) and 40% thorium oxide (ThO2), with a breeding ratio of 1. 05, and a burnup of 30 MWd/kgU. 2. 3. The fuel region is surrounded by the blanket region, which is cooled by natural convection. 4. The reactor core has an outer radius of 1 m and an inner radius of 0. 5 m. 5. The coolant is helium at a pressure of 2 MPa. 6. The reactor operates in the equilibrium state with a fuel temperature of 700°C, a coolant temperature of 400°C, and a linear heat generation rate of 18 kW/m. 7. The reactivity coefficients are calculated using the two-region code developed at KAERI. The results show that the breeding ratio is 1. 05 and the excess reactivity is negative, indicating a self-sustaining chain reaction. The conversion ratio of U-238 to Pu-239 is 0. 66, which is lower than the design value of 0. 7. This can be improved by increasing the breeding ratio or reducing the burnup in the fuel region.

The reactor system is at equilibrium with regard to nuclei concentrations. Hydroclone separation of poisons from the core system is employed in addition to Thorex processing. The poison fraction due to samarium is 0. 8%, that due to xenon is 1%. The external core system has 1. 0 liter of volume for every 20 kW of core power, while the blanket external system has 1. 0 liter for every 14 kW of total reactor power. 5 thermal MW. The average core and blanket temperatures are 280°C.

The breeding ratio for the reactor variables considered is plotted in Figure 2-11 as a function of pressure vessel size for 4- and 5-ft-diameter cores with several blanket thorium concentrations. More extensive results, including neutron balances, are given in Table 2-8 for selected reactors.

Some materials that act as neutron poisons can be altered by reactor system design. These include fission product poisons, core tank material, contaminants such as H2O, and additives such as the cupric ion. The effect of these on the breeding ratio is discussed below.

Achievement of a xenon poison fraction of 0. 01, as postulated in the computations for -11 and Table 2-8, requires the removal of most of the xenon or its iodine precursor before neutron capture occurs. If there is no fast-cycle system for iodine or xenon removal, the poison fraction breeding ratio would be reduced by about 0. 03 below the values given in -11 if all xenon were retained in the core system.

Absorptions in copper. Copper can be added to act as a recombination catalyst for decomposed water. The poison fraction attributable to copper in various concentrations and the effects on breeding ratio (ABR) are estimated in Table 2-9. For other copper concentrations, the poisoning effects would be proportionate to the values in Table 2-9.

H2O contamination. Any H2O contained in the heavy-water moderator will act as a poison and reduce the breeding ratio. The above results are based on the use of heavy water containing 0. 25% H2O. Neutron captures in the moderator in a 4-ft-core reactor (see Table 2-8) were found to be about 0. 009 per absorption in fuel, of which about 60% were in He. Thus, 0. 25% H2O, which is 9 liters in a 3600-liter system, reduced the breeding values in Table 2-10.

The absorption cross sections of iron and chromium would be unimportant. The nickel and manganese would yield a poison fraction of about 0. 04.

An additional point of concern resulting from corrosion of stainless steel is the adverse effect of high corrosion product concentrations on the stability of the fuel solution. The concentration of nickel resulting from this would be 0. 011 g/mole/liter.

The corrosion products from the Zircaloy-2 core vessel would not appreciably affect the breeding ratio even if they remained in suspension. Owing to the dilution effect associated with the large external volume, corrosion of the core tank would result in a slight increase in the breeding ratio.

2-3. 4 Equilibrium results for two-region uranium-plutonium reactors. Of these, the system which gives the highest conversion ratio is the one containing UO3-D2O. However, because of the relatively low values for n(U235) and 7(Pu9), it is presently considered that the attainment of a conversion ratio as great as unity under equilibrium conditions is impractical because of the high fuel-processing rates and the large reactor sizes that would be required.

2-3. 5 One-region reactors. Single-region reactors have simpler designs than two-region reactors by virtue of having only a single fuel region. Also, fuel processing costs for one-region reactors are generally lower than for two-region systems. However, to attain breeding or conversion ratios comparable to those in a 10-ft-diameter two-region reactor, the diameter of a one-region reactor has to be about 15 ft or greater. The construction of pressure vessels of such diameters is difficult, and relatively little experience on such construction has been obtained to date. In the succeeding sections, some equilibrium results are given for the nuclear characteristics of one-region breeder and converter reactors.

Equilibrium results for one-region thorium breeder reactors have been obtained for reactors operating under equilibrium conditions. Critical concentrations and breeding ratios were determined using Eqs. (2-4) and (2-6). Figure 2-13 depicts the breeding ratio as a function of thorium concentration and reactor diameter. A comparison of these results with those obtained for two-region reactors shows that reactor diameter has a greater influence on the breeding ratio in one-region systems than in two-region systems. Additionally, increasing the reactor diameter significantly enhances the breeding ratio, even for 14-ft-diameter reactors.

Value has been chosen because it represents the diameter which gives minimum fuel costs, although it is realized that construction of the corresponding vessel may be beyond present technology. The fuel-processing cycle time which minimized fuel cost was that which corresponded to a poison fraction (due to fission products) of about 0. 08, and so this is the value used for poison fraction in the results given here. Absorptions in higher isotopes contributed an additional poison fraction of about 0. 03.

Equilibrium results for one-region uranium-plutonium reactors: The fertile material concentrations and reactor diameters have essentially the same effects on the conversion ratio and fuel inventory for one-region uranium-plutonium systems as they do for thorium breeder systems. However, since the cross sections for U25 and Pu are lower than for U3, it is more difficult to attain a conversion ratio of unity in U-Pu systems than it is in U33_Th systems. It is still possible, though, for UO3-PuO2-D2O systems to operate on natural-uranium feed, as evidenced by the results for two-region reactors. Minimum fuel costs (based on 74! = 1. 9, a more accurate value is now believed to be 2. 2) for one-region reactors, however, occur when the uranium feed is slightly enriched in U. Table 2-12 provides results of some nuclear calculations for these one-region systems operating under equilibrium conditions. The reactor diameter was taken to be 15 ft; the fuel-processing rate was such as to maintain a poison fraction of 7% in the reactor core. Fuel feed was considered to be obtained from an isotope-enrichment diffusion plant.

2-4. 1 Two-region reactors. During the period following reactor startup, there is a buildup of fission-product poisons and higher isotopes with time, which results in varying nuclear characteristics. This section presents some calculations relative to the HRE-3 conceptual design for the initial period of reactor operation. 2-4. 2 Three-region reactors. The three-region model is a more complex representation of the fuel-rod behavior that takes into account the presence of an inner and outer region in addition to the central region where fission occurs.

Computations have been performed for several spherical reactors using an Oracle code for two-region, time-dependent, thorium breeder obtained. Calculations were first confined to solution-core reactors initially containing either U83 or U5, and generating a core power of 50 MW. Core and blanket Thorex processing was considered only when the initial fuel was U3. The use of centrifugal separation (hydroclones) for core-solution processing was assumed in all cases. The time dependence of the concentrations of xenon, the samarium group of poisons, and the poisons removable by hydroclone processing were neglected, since the time required for these poisons to reach near-equilibrium conditions is relatively short. Account has been taken of their presence by the use of fixed poison fractions. The effect of copper added for internal gas recombination was also included in this way. Core diameters of 4 and 5 ft, pressure-vessel diameters of 8 and 9 ft, and thorium blanket concentrations of 500 and 1000 g/liter were considered.

Core fission cross sections were: samarium group, 0. 8%; xenon group, 1%; copper, 0. 8%; poisons removable by hydroclones, 1%. 8%; xenon, 1%. It was assumed that the core solution was processed both by hydroclones and by the Thorex process described in Chapter 6. The blanket slurry of thorium oxide in heavy water was processed by Thorex only, and fuel produced in the blanket was drawn off from the Thorex plant and returned to the core at a rate sufficient to maintain criticality.

The system was assumed to start "clean, except for the poisons mentioned, with either U33 or U35 in the core. Makeup fuel (same as initial fuel) was fed as needed while the concentration of fuel in the blanket was increasing. When the blanket fuel concentration reached a predetermined level, blanket processing was initiated at the rate which would be required if the reactor were at equilibrium. However, for the U85-fueled reactors, calculations were performed only up to the time at which processing would start. At the start of processing, the fuel feed for the core was assumed to come from the processed blanket stream. When the core poison level built up to a predetermined point (8% for the U reactors), processing of the core solution was started. The calculations were continued until most of the concentrations approached equilibrium values. Time lags due to chemical processing holdups were neglected. The chemical processing rates employed were those calculated earlier for equilibrium reactors. ".

The curves in Figure 15 show results for some representative U33-fueled reactors. As shown in Figure 15(a), with 1000 g Th/liter in the blanket region, the breeding ratio falls steadily for about 900 days until core processing starts. Although blanket processing, begun at 490 days, arrests the growth of U33 in the blanket rather suddenly, the slope of the breeding ratio curve does not change markedly because the buildup of core poisons is controlling the breeding ratio. The variation of relative leakage and poison losses with time and the variation of blanket power with time are illustrated in Figure 15(b) for the case of a blanket thorium concentration of 500 g/liter.

In all cases, the time required to reach the 8% core poison level was of the order of two years. The average breeding ratio during this period was about 0. 02 higher than the equilibrium value. The effect of poisoning due to buildup of corrosion products is not included in this estimate.

Such reactors have appreciably lower breeding ratios than do U33-fueled systems. This is primarily due to the relatively low value of 75 compared with a U35-fueled reactor, which has an average value of 7 for the reactor as a whole. This helps compensate for the increase in core poison fraction and causes the breeding ratio, which initially drops from 1. 008 to 1. 002 during the first 200 days of operation, to rise again. A maximum of 1.

Three types of isotopic growth were obtained in this study. First, the concentration of the main isotope, U-3 or U-235, remained relatively constant despite significant changes in other concentrations. Second, the protactinium concentration-time curve was found to "knee over" even before processing started. This behavior was due to the radioactive decay rate being several times larger than the chemical processing rates employed. Third, the concentration of the heavier isotopes of uranium built up slowly with time for the assumed power level, but their concentrations were much less than the equilibrium values after 10 years of operation. The isotope concentrations after various operating times are shown in Table 2-13, along with equilibrium values.

While chemical processing sharply discontinues the growth of U33 in the blanket, the power level in the blanket may markedly overshoot the equilibrium level, as shown in Figure 2-15(b). An overshoot is obtained when the blanket-U%3 concentration reaches its maximum value before core processing starts. Table 2-14 shows the peak values of blanket power computed for the reactors studied, along with the equilibrium values.

Results similar to those given above have also been obtained for two-region breeders having various concentrations of thorium in the core. The core diameter was set at 4 ft, the pressure-vessel diameter at 9 ft, and the blanket thorium concentration at 1000 g Th/liter. The core thorium concentrations studied were 100, 150, and 200 g Th/liter. As before, the moderator was heavy water in both core and blanket volumes, and both regions operated at a mean temperature of 280°C. The Zircaloy-2 core tank of 60 thermal MW.

Results given in -16 are for a core thorium concentration of 150 g Th/liter and are typical of all cases studied in their important features. As with solution-core reactors, there is a small but relatively rapid initial drop in breeding ratio during the first 100 days following reactor startup. This is due to the neutron captures in protactinium as its concentration rises and approaches equilibrium conditions. The buildup of protactinium is quite similar to the behavior seen in the solution-core cases. Equilibrium protactinium levels are reached in both core and blanket long before chemical processing is started. This period is followed by a more or less linear fall in breeding ratio with time, due to core poison-fraction buildup. Initiation of blanket processing produces a relatively minor change in the slope of the breeding ratio-time curve, in contrast to the sharp break caused by the start of core processing. Linear buildups with time of the poison fractions and the higher isotopes are also observed, with U4 in the core being the most important higher isotope. Other isotope concentrations are comparatively low even at 1500 days.

Figure 2-17 lists some results for the various cases considered (except for the case already considered in -16). Comparison of the results shows that the time at which core processing is initiated increases with increasing core thorium concentration (except for the solution-core case). The time specified for core processing to begin in -17 corresponds to the initiation of Thorex processing. It is interesting to note that with slurry cores, despite the absence of hydroclone separation, the core poison fraction still takes two or more years to reach a 7% level.

In these calculations, there was no allowance for the poisoning effect of accumulated corrosion products. Absence of hydroclone processing would result in the retention of all corrosion products in the core system, and for the same corrosion rate, the cross-section of corrosion products is about four times as great as in a solution-core system using hydroclones. However, the higher critical concentrations in slurry-core systems compensate for this, and the poison fraction in the core with 200 g Th/liter could be about the same as in a solution-core reactor.

Comparison of breeding ratios and U-33 core concentrations for two region breeder reactors with various core-thorium concentrations. Core diameter = 4 ft, reactor diameter = 9 ft, 280°C. Blanket thorium concentration = 1000 g/liter. Blanket processing started when U%3 blanket concentration reached 3 g/liter.

2-4. 2 One-region reactors. The critical equation for one-region reactors is not so involved as that for two-region systems, and so the mathematical system analogous to the one used above for two-region systems is comparatively simple. However, relatively few nuclear results for one-region, time-dependent systems have been obtained specifically. Some results are given in Reference [29] for a 15-ft-diameter reactor containing 200 g of uranium per liter and operating at a constant power of 1350 MW (heat) of fissions due to U-235 were obtained as functions of time.

Reactor kinetic studies are usually broken down into investigations of reactor safety and reactor stability. Both safety and stability are determined by the generalized equations of motion involved. As used here, safety refers to the events which happen as a result of the initial power excursion following a reactivity addition. The reactor would be safe with respect to the first power surge but would not be safe to subsequent power surges. On the other hand, a reactor system can be stable and still not be safe; i. e.

The majority of work on the kinetics of homogeneous reactors has concerned circulating, pressurized-type systems, and the discussion below pertains primarily to those systems. For these reactors, the control and safety problems may be more difficult than for the nonboiling reactors. In boiling systems, the most important parameters are those associated with vapor formation and bubble growth, vapor removal from the system, and the control system. With regard to control, boiling reactors have the disadvantage of producing more power when less power is demanded unless a control system is used, in which an increase in reactor pressure leads to ejection of fuel from the core region. Alternatively, power-demand control can be obtained by permitting the boiling process to generate only a fraction of the total reactor power, the remainder being removed by fuel fluid circulated through a heat exchanger.

And the possible reactivity additions. Despite the inherent safety associated with a large negative temperature coefficient of reactivity, it cannot be stated a priori that homogeneous reactors will be safe under all operating conditions.

With a given limit on the maximum permissible pressure rise, it is possible to specify the maximum permissible reactivity addition that can be added to the reactor.

The potential reactivity available in homogeneous systems is inherently large because a high operating temperature is coupled with a high negative temperature coefficient of reactivity. However, all reactivity additions involve a time element. Specifically, the maximum permissible linear rate of reactivity addition should specify what restrictions are necessary on the physical system so that this rate is not exceeded.

Equations of motion. The neutron density is the fundamental variable in homogeneous reactor safety and is influenced primarily by the temperature and density of the moderator and by the operational changes which affect a reactivity change. So long as the reactor is not far above prompt critical, the neutron density is given by the conventional equations of motion.

Reactivity additions, which involve homogeneous reactor safety, are considerably in excess of that required for prompt criticality, and for these cases, the reactor power reaches a maximum value in times of the order of tenths of seconds. Such time intervals are short compared with the average half-life of the delayed-neutron precursors, and so only a small fraction of the precursors formed during the power rise decay during that time interval. The delayed neutrons from these precursors, therefore, contribute little to the reactor power while the power is rising. Rather, they are formed following the time of peak power and exert a powerful damping influence on the power oscillation, leading to a single, damped power surge. For these safety calculations, the delayed-neutron density can be considered.

To complete the mathematical system, the relation between k and P is required, which requires intermediate relations. For aqueous systems operating above 200°C, k is influenced primarily by fluid-density effects, insofar as inherent reactivity changes are concerned. Since reactivity can also be added by physical operations, k can be considered to be given by where k is the rate constant for aqueous systems at high temperatures and pressures, P is the system pressure, R is the gas constant, T is the absolute temperature, and ΔH is the enthalpy of reaction.

The core fluid density is determined from the hydrodynamic equations of continuity and motion, in conjunction with the equation of state for the fluid. In most studies to date, a one-dimensional flow model is assumed; gas effects are neglected; the core tank is considered to be rigid, and the core inlet fluid velocity is considered to be constant.

Where ny = resistance coefficient associated with velocity U, A(z) = cross-sectional area of relief pipe, gc = dimensional constant, Pe = core pressure, Pp = pressurizer pressure, U = average velocity of fluid in relief piping, and L = length of relief piping from core to pressurizer.

Calculation of reactor pressure rise. The variable of interest is the maximum value of core pressure for a given set of parameter values. Although not exact, an analytic expression for the maximum pressure rise, Pmax, can be derived for the case of an instantaneous reactivity addition.

Equation (2-28) is based on an instantaneous reactivity addition, but it can be applied to rate additions of reactivity in certain circumstances. For rate additions normally encountered in homogeneous systems, it appears that the most dangerous amounts of reactivity can be added when the initial reactor power is low. In these circumstances, reactivity is added during an interval which is much greater than the time interval in which the reactivity is decreased as a result of fluid density changes.

Reactivity changes can also occur as a result of changes in fuel concentration or distribution. In slurry reactors, large changes in reactivity can result from settling of the fertile material. The results of two-group, two-dimensional, two-region calculations are shown in Table 2-15 for a cylindrical reactor containing highly enriched UO2SO4 in a 5-ft diameter core region, and ThO2 in a 24-ft-thick blanket region. The average temperature was assumed to be 280°C, and the height was assumed to be equal to the diameter for both the core and pressure vessel.

Although the calculated reactivity additions associated with slurry settling were quite large, such additions would not occur instantaneously; rather, they would be a function of time, with the rate of reactivity addition being controlled by the rate at which the slurry settled. Settling data for slurries containing 1000 or 500 g Th/liter correspond to rates of reactivity addition of less than 0. 02% Ak/sec.

Settling of fuel and fertile material in large single-region reactors may cause the reactor to become subcritical. The results of two-group calculations for Dz0-ThO2-U303 reactors, 10 and 12 ft in diameter, and containing 200 and 300 g Th/liter are given in Table 20.

Geometry was assumed, with a height/diameter ratio equal to one. The slurry was assumed to be homogeneously distributed in the bottom portion of the reactor, with a D2O reflector on top. In -20°C, the amount of fuel required for criticality (after settling) is compared with the amount of fuel initially required (before settling).

In the previous analytical presentation, the effect of decomposition gases upon reactor safety has been tacitly neglected. However, the generation of hydrogen and oxygen from the decomposition of water represents a possible explosion hazard. If the fuel contains no catalyst for recombination, gas bubbles will form and contain an explosive mixture of hydrogen, oxygen, and water vapor. Explosions might occur in the core, gas separator, recombiner system, or connecting piping. If an explosion occurs outside the reactor core, reactivity can be added to the reactor, resulting in an undesirably high power surge. Under these conditions, not only must the gas explosion be considered but also the possible reactivity addition associated with the explosion. If no explosion occurs, the presence of gases will still influence the compressibility of the fuel fluid, and this effect can be considered in the evaluation of fluid compressibility. If the reactor is at low power and reactivity is added to the system, then neglect of gas formation is conservative with respect to safety evaluation since in this case the formation of gases helps in decreasing the reactivity of the system.

Neglect of gas formation in evaluating reactor safety is justified if complete recombination of the decomposed gases is achieved within the reactor, or if the reactor is initially operating at a power so low that decomposition gases are not formed (corresponding to absorption of the decomposition gases by the fuel solution). If the initial power is so high that undissolved gases are initially present within the core region, then the effect of these gases must be considered in evaluating fluid compressibility. The presence of undissolved gases would tend to lower the permissible reactivity addition; however, an increase in gas volume would imply an increase in initial reactor power, which aids reactor safety if reactivity can be added as a rate function only.

The number of fission neutrons, which are delayed, is usually considered an important factor in reactor safety. However, if reactivity is added as a linear rate function at low initial reactor power, the delayed neutrons have little influence upon the reactivity addition above prompt critical. They will influence the stability and steady-state operational behavior of the reactor, though, and are necessary to damp the power oscillation following a reactivity addition.

Reactor safety also involves events which are not directly associated with reactivity additions. For example, if the circulating pump failed, or if there were a sudden cessation of heat removal in the heat exchanger, after-heat effects may raise the temperature (and pressure) of the system to undesirably high values. The possibility of an instantaneous rupture of a high-pressure steam line, however, is remote, based on experience in conventional plants.

2-5. 2 Homogeneous reactor stability. The purpose of stability studies is to determine whether the reactor power will return to a stable equilibrium condition following a system disturbance. Although inherently connected with safety, stability studies usually treat small reactivity additions and concern time intervals long in comparison with those involved in safety studies. The general stability problem can be broken into simpler problems by eliminating those parts of the physical system which have only a small influence upon the time behavior of the variable of interest.

The most familiar of stability studies concerns the reactor core-pressurizer system and will be referred to as "nuclear stability studies. " These studies consider the high-pressure system alone and assume that the power demand is constant.

Reactor instabilities can also arise due to interactions between the reactor primary system, heat-removal system, and fuel-storage system. These are associated with the method of reactor operation and are discussed under the heading of Operational Stability.

Under certain conditions, it may be desirable to operate reactors with fission gases retained within the system. In these circumstances, the buildup of Xe-135 during periods of low-power operation may influence subsequent reactor operation. Reactivity effects and required fuel concentration changes associated with Xe-135 buildup and burnup are discussed below under the appropriate section.

Nuclear stability. In studying nuclear stability, the equations of motion for a single-region reactor system are normally used. These should be adequate if the reactor behavior is controlled by a single region; however, it should be remembered that the mean lifetime of prompt neutrons should be that for the reactor as a whole. The general mathematical system is too complicated to handle analytically, so that it is necessary either to resort to numerical methods or to make some simplifying assumptions. This leads to a set of differential equations for the evolution of the various reactor parameters with time.

To numerical integration of specific cases or to linearize the equations so that they can be treated analytically. The linearized approach is valid for very small power oscillations since the nonlinear effects appear to introduce damping of the power surges, the reactor system should be stable if the stability criteria for the linearized equations are satisfied.

The conventional equations of motion given in Eqs. (2-21) through (2-27) are used, except that the delayed-neutron precursors are assumed to decay in accordance with a single effective decay constant, and fluid flow effects are considered in which the average fuel-fluid temperature is the linear average of the core inlet and outlet temperatures. Heat exchanger behavior will also affect the temperature of the fuel fluid and is to be considered. The resulting linearized equations lead to an equation defining the criteria for stability of the reactor system. If only the reactor core and pressurizer system are considered, corresponding to a relatively large residence time for fluid in the core, the stability criteria are given by: where k is the thermal conductivity of the fuel element material, T is the average fuel-fluid temperature, Q is the heat generation rate per unit volume of fuel, and ΔT is the difference between the maximum and minimum temperatures in the core. The parameter ε is a measure of the efficiency of heat transfer from the fuel to the fluid, which depends on the geometry and flow conditions in the core.

Since all quantities are positive, the last inequality is always satisfied. Replacing the other inequality with an equal sign and fixing all parameters but one, the value of the remaining parameter (which barely fails to satisfy the inequality) can be obtained. By this procedure, the results given in -21 were obtained for a specific value of y. Stable operating conditions are those lying above the appropriate curve.

The above treatment neglects any effects that fluid transport and heat exchanger behavior might have upon the temperature of the fluid entering the reactor. On this basis, the results given in -21 form reasonable bases for safe design.

A one-region reactor will operate at a power density lower than that at which the corresponding two-region reactor is operated if the physical size of the one-region reactor is large. Based on the stability criteria given in -21, about the same degree of stability will result if the product of w w remains constant in going from a one- to a two-region reactor.

Reactors do have WW which are roughly equal, with the one-region reactor being somewhat more stable. However, there appears to be no distinct advantage of one type over the other as regards nuclear stability, since both normally will operate well within the stable region.

Operational Stability. Other types of stability which might be considered concern the response of the reactor to changes in load demand and to changes in rates of flow between the low- and high-pressure systems. These usually involve power oscillations whose frequencies are much lower than those sustained by the core-pressurizer system. In these circumstances, the general equations of motion can be simplified; however, load-demand studies will concern the particular characteristics of the heat exchanger.

Changes in fluid flow rates between the high- and low-pressure systems in reactors can also influence reactor stability. During the operation of the HRE-1, it was noticed that under certain conditions the temperature and power of the reactor would rise with time. This effect was termed the "walkaway phenomenon" [39]. It was associated with a slow rate of reactivity addition produced by an increase in core fuel concentration, leading to an increase in operating power and temperature. This increase in fuel concentration resulted when water was removed from the core (as a result of decomposition-gas formation and accompanying vaporization of water) at a faster rate than it was returned from the low-pressure system. This process continued until it was stopped by the operator.

The above type of phenomenon is a function of fuel flow rates between the low- and high-pressure systems and can therefore be controlled. Using the applicable linearized equations of motion, the criteria for stability toward walkaway can be obtained. This has been done for the HRE-2. Design parameters such as operating conditions, fluid flow rates, vessel volumes, recombination rate of decomposition gases, and other conditions will influence the degree of stability. If gas is formed, a paramount cause of instability is insufficient overpressure. Walkaway can also be prevented by automatic control devices that influence the behavior of the heat exchanger. Walkaway conditions can be instigated by reducing overpressure or by increasing the rate of gas formation.

Effect of Xe-135 upon reactor behavior. If reactors are operated with complete recombination of the decomposition gases and no letdown from the high-pressure system, there will be virtually complete retention of the fission fragments and the fission-product gases within the reactor system. Under such conditions, partial or total reactor shutdown will lead to an increase in Xe-135 concentration, which might, in turn, lead to difficulties in maintaining criticality or reaching criticality upon subsequent power demand. To investigate the above effect, calculations were performed for a 4-ft-diameter spherical reactor operating at 280°C, containing U-235, heavy water, I-135, and Xe-135, and operating at initial fluxes of 10^3 to 10^5 neutrons/(cm^2 sec). For these cases, the reactor power was reduced either to zero or to one-tenth the initial value, and the fuel concentration required for criticality was obtained for times following the power reduction. At the time that the xenon concentration reached a maximum value, the power was returned to its original level, and at this point, the maximum rate of reactivity addition associated with xenon burnout was obtained. The rate of change in fuel concentration required to maintain criticality at this point was also obtained.

In addition, the time required for the xenon concentration to reach a minimum value following return to power was evaluated. Table 2-16 summarizes the results obtained and, for comparison purposes, also includes results for a reactor of infinite diameter. As shown in Table 2-16, the maximum rate of reactivity addition associated with xenon burnout was less than 1073 Ak/s, which does not appear to constitute a dangerous rate.

The reaction or the decrease in temperature required to maintain criticality following partial or total shutdown is so large that provisions should be made for elimination of xenon by external means. At 10+ average flux, it appears that xenon poisoning may be compensated by decreasing the reactor power level, increasing the fuel enrichment, or both.

The chemical and physical properties of aqueous fuel solutions are important because they affect the design, construction, operation, and safety of homogeneous reactors in which they are used.

Solubility relationships are discussed first, with data for uranyl sulfate followed by information concerning other fissile and fertile materials. The effects of radiation on water; the decomposition of water by fission fragments; the recombination of radiolytic hydrogen-oxygen gas; the decomposition of peroxide in reactor solutions; and the effects of radiation on nitrate solutes are then presented.

3-2. 1 General. For the most part, studies of aqueous solutions of fissile materials for use in homogeneous reactors have dealt with hexavalent uranium salts of the strong mineral acids. Hexavalent uranium in aqueous solutions appears as the divalent uranyl ion, UO2++. Other valence states of uranium either disproportionate or form very insoluble compounds and have not been seriously proposed as fuel solutes.

Phase separation in solvent extraction processes is observed through the emergence of a uranium-rich second liquid phase from concentrated solutions. The uranium-to-sulfate ratio in both phases exceeds that in the system at lower temperatures, indicating the role of uranyl ion hydrolysis in the immiscibility phenomenon. Effective suppression of hydrolysis can be achieved by enhancing the solution's acidity or introducing a compatible complexing agent for the uranyl ion. Even the solute's anions can contribute to this effect, with hydrolysis more pronounced in dilute solutions compared to concentrated ones.

Primary emphasis has been placed on the study of uranyl sulfate solutions because of the superiority of the sulfate over other anions with respect to thermal and radiation stability, absorption cross-section for neutrons, ease of chemical processing, and corrosive properties. Other uranyl salts that have either been used in reactors or studied for possible use include the nitrate, phosphate, fluoride, chromate, and carbonate.

The marked differences between light water and heavy water with respect to moderating ability and thermal neutron absorption cross section make both solvents of interest for reactor use. Generally speaking, the upper temperature limit of solution stability occurs about 10°C lower in heavy-water solutions than in light-water solutions.

Tetravalent uranium can be stabilized by increasing the reduction potential of the solution. However, tetravalent uranium is more readily hydrolyzed at elevated temperatures than hexavalent uranium, and it probably cannot be kept in solution except by the use of otherwise excessively high concentrations of acid.

Plutonium, the other fissile material, also forms salts that can be dissolved in water. The possibility of using such solutions in aqueous homogeneous reactor systems has been examined, and limited experimental studies have been directed toward this goal but without substantial success.

Uranium-238 and thorium, the fertile materials, have been considered for use in converter or breeder reactor systems. The solubility of uranium is such that satisfactory aqueous solutions of uranium can be obtained for use in the conversion of U38 to plutonium.

And thorium phosphate can be maintained in solution at satisfactory concentrations by the use of substantial concentrations of nitric or phosphoric acids to inhibit hydrolysis. However, in the nitrate system, an acceptable breeding ratio could only be obtained by using N5. Thorium phosphate solutions containing the necessary amount of phosphoric acid are extremely corrosive to all but the noble metals.

Neptunium and protactinium complete the listing of fissile and fertile materials, since these are intermediates in the production of plutonium and U-33 from U-8 and thorium. Limited exploratory studies of their solubilities have been carried out primarily in connection with the development of processes for their continuous removal from blanket systems.

Basic solid phase, 8B-UO3 - H2O, occurs in very dilute solutions at elevated temperatures, and the position of the tie lines in the liquid-liquid miscibility gap. Figure 3-2 shows portions of the ternary isotherms at increasing temperature to the extent that at 250°C excess acid is required to maintain homogeneity in solutions of low concentration. Figure 3-4 shows this intersection and three paths on the liquidus surface at fixed SO3/UO3 mole ratios.

The effect of excess H2SO4 on the phase equilibria in very dilute UO2SO4. Corrosion of stainless steel by sulfuric acid and its effects on corrosion product formation. The influence of temperature on the dissolution rate of uranium dioxide in concentrated sulfuric acid.

The addition of lithium sulfate or beryllium sulfate to uranyl sulfate solutions has been found to elevate the temperatures at which the second liquid phase appears. Copper sulfate solutions, like uranyl sulfate, undergo hydrolytic precipitation at elevated temperatures. Even though the required concentration of cupric ion may be quite low, its presence influences the phase relationships. A complete phase diagram for the four-component system, CuO-UO3-SO3-H2O, has not been determined, but regions of special interest have been studied. Figure 3-8 shows the phase transition temperatures in solutions containing copper sulfate, uranyl sulfate, and sulfuric acid. The solid phase which appears at the higher CuSO4 concentrations has been shown to be at least in part the basic copper sulfate, 3CuO-SO3-2H2O.

In uranyl sulfate solutions in contact with austenitic stainless steels, it is important to know the effect of the corrosion products upon the solubility relationships. Under most conditions, iron and chromium appear as insoluble hydrolytic products, but nickel appears as a soluble contaminant of the solution. Studies have been made of the precipitation temperatures, and the solid phases have been identified. Figure 3-9 summarizes the information for systems having compositions approximately that of the fuel solution of the HRE-2. In this preliminary study, the tests were 0. 01 m NiSO4 or 0. 02 m CuSO4 with no NiSO4 were heated for longer periods of time at 300 to 310°C (just below the temperature for the formation of two liquid phases), green solids were deposited. Thus, the results pictured in -9 should be applied to practical situations with considerable reservation until experiments with the exact composition of interest have been conducted.

The system uranyl nitrate-water is shown in Figure 10. Although uranyl nitrate remains very soluble at the elevated temperatures of interest for power-reactor operation, the nitrate group in such solutions decomposes to yield oxides of nitrogen, which appear in the vapor phase. Although this situation is reversible with the lowering of temperature, it does introduce corrosion problems with respect to the vapor phase.

Nitrate ion is, moreover, not completely stable in fissioning solutions; elemental nitrogen is one of the products of radiation decomposition. Although uranyl nitrate solutions have proved quite satisfactory in low-power water-boiler type research reactors where makeup nitric acid can be added as needed, they do not appear attractive for high-temperature, high-power aqueous homogeneous reactors.

Uranyl fluoride is a very attractive fuel solute because of the low neutron capture cross-section of fluorine. However, at high temperatures, it undergoes hydrolysis, which means that excess HF would be required to maintain homogeneity. Hydrogen fluoride is also a component of the vapor phase. Both liquid and vapor are very corrosive toward zirconium and titanium, but less corrosive toward stainless steel (see Article 5-3. 3).

Uranium phosphate. Neither hexavalent nor tetravalent uranium phosphate is sufficiently soluble in water to be of reactor interest, but both UO2 and UO3 are quite soluble in moderately strong phosphoric acid. These solutions have been the subject of considerable study at the Los Alamos Scientific Laboratory. The solubility of UO3 in phosphoric acid is illustrated by -12.

Phosphate and uranium sulfate in water are quite different; their respective solubilities in concentrated phosphoric acid and concentrated sulfuric acid are analogous. In either case, temperatures as high as 450°C can be obtained with no phase separation. Phosphorus has an advantage over sulfur in possessing a somewhat lower neutron absorption cross-section, but both anions appear to be stable under radiation. Both the phosphate and sulfate solutions in concentrated acid at temperatures of 450°C are extremely corrosive toward most metals and alloys except the noble metals. Attempts to operate experimental high-temperature reactors using uranium phosphate-phosphoric acid fuel solutions have failed because of catastrophic corrosion rates due to imperfections in noble metal plating or cladding of the reactor core and heat-exchanger tubing.

Uranyl chromate. Uranyl chromate solutions also suffer from hydrolysis at elevated temperatures; excess chromic acid is required for stability. This system is, however, not unattractive insofar as corrosion of stainless and carbon steels is concerned.

Reduction potential determines the valence state of the chromium, but present knowledge is not adequate to specify required conditions for reliable behavior at elevated temperatures and under reactor radiation. Figure 3-13 shows the phase diagram insofar as it has been established.

Uranyl carbonate. Uranium trioxide is quite soluble in alkali carbonate solutions. This solubility can be attributed to the complexing of UO3 or uranyl ion by the bicarbonate ion to form uranium-containing anions. In any event, one would not expect the solubility of uranium to be retained at high temperature unless the carbonate content of the aqueous phase were kept high. This can be accomplished by retaining an adequately high partial pressure of CO2 over the solution. The solubility of UO3 in at a constant CO2 pressure, the concentration of uranium increases linearly with the lithium concentration until a limit is reached at the isobaric invariant. The uranium concentration cannot be increased further unless the CO2 pressure is increased. Figure 3-15 is a projection of the compositions of solutions saturated with respect to lithium and uranium at 250°C and at a constant total pressure (CO2 + steam) of 1500 psi. The projection is correct now.

The figure gives no information concerning the concentration of carbonate in the liquid phase. The region in which a single homogeneous liquid phase exists is the very narrow shaded region near the H2O apex.

Thorium nitrate or phosphate solutions, in the presence of excess acid, have been demonstrated to have the required solubilities at elevated temperatures. Both of these solutions have substantial disadvantages. Complex organic salts, such as thorium acetylacetonate, have high solubilities at relatively low temperatures, but these have not been investigated for use in aqueous solutions at temperatures above 100°C.

Ratios of 5 and 7 could be prepared and appeared to be thermally stable but had high viscosities. Solutions containing 400 g Th/liter at PO4/Th ratios of 10 were thermally stable at 250 to 300°C with viscosities little higher than that of concentrated phosphoric acid. Efforts to improve the properties of thorium phosphate-phosphoric acid systems by the inclusion of have not proved encouraging.

The thorium nitrate-water system has been reported to have considerable solubility up to about 225°C, at which point hydrolytic precipitation occurs. Further investigation revealed a maximal stability for the 80 w/o material (to around 255°C). Increasing the acidity of the solutions (increasing the NO3/Th ratio) suppresses hydrolysis and increases the stability of the solutions, as indicated by Figure 3-16, which shows the precipitation temperatures for various solutions. The intensity of vapor-phase coloration at elevated temperatures (rapidly reversible) increased as the nitrate/thorium ratio was raised above 4. 0.

Plutonium. A considerable investigation of the chemistry of plutonium in aqueous uranyl sulfate solutions has been directed, not toward the achievement of solubility, but toward the achievement of insolubility in order to provide the basis for continuous processing of a U% blanket solution for plutonium production (see Chapter 6).

Limited experimental work has been performed in which the solubilities of plutonium carbonates, sulfates, and phosphates have been determined at temperatures up to 300°C. No substantial solubilities have been established at temperatures above 200°C.

Protactinium. No efforts have been made to achieve high solubilities of protactinium in order to use it as a component of reactor fuel solutions. Rather, the chemistry of protactinium has been examined in order to devise processes for removing Pa continuously from thorium breeder blanket systems.

Neptunium, Np, is in a class with Pa. No efforts have been made to use it as a fuel solute, but consideration has been given to its formation in and removal from blanket solutions of U. The chemistry of neptunium has been reviewed by Hindman et al. Continuous separation of Np would provide a Pu product of high purity by radioactive decay, whereas plutonium recovered from long-term irradiation of U usually contains appreciable amounts of Pu. Dilute solutions of neptunyl nitrate in nitric acid have been studied at temperatures up to 250°C; the pentavalent state was found to be stable under the test conditions.

Reactor design and operation. Energy will be dissipated in a fuel solution by the stopping of fast charged particles. These include mainly the fission recoil particles, the recoil particles such as protons produced by elastic neutron scattering, and the fast electrons resulting from the absorption of gamma rays and from the decay of radioactive fission products.

Water is decomposed by all types of high-energy radiations to give hydrogen, hydrogen peroxide, and oxygen. If the decomposition products are confined in solution, a radiation-induced back reaction will occur and, eventually, steady-state concentrations (pressures) of products will be attained. In particular, the addition of hydrogen suppresses the decomposition of pure water.

3-3. 2 Primary and secondary reactions in pure water. The fast charged particles give up energy to the electronic systems of the molecules of the medium, thereby producing various excited and ionized states. In liquid water, the ionized and excited molecules are rapidly transformed into the free radicals H and OH. These are formed in relatively high concentrations along the tracks of the fission recoils or other charged particles. The primary chemical species are therefore considered to be H, OH, He, and H2O: their yields per 100 eV of energy absorbed are expressed as G(H), G(OH), G(H2), and G(H2O2). The primary chemical reaction can be written: 4-4. 1 Secondary reactions in pure water. These reactions occur through a chain reaction mechanism involving the radicals H, OH, and HO2. This can lead to a variety of damaging effects, including strand breaks, base modifications, cross-links, and clustered lesions.

Some minor subtleties emerging from recent studies of the radiolysis of aqueous solutions are: (a) although stoichiometry demands that G(H) + yields H2 and H2O2 are not necessarily equal to each other [32]; (b) the yields of H2 and H2O2 are lowered by solutes, which scavenge the precursors in the particle tracks [33]; (c) H2O2 may be another "primary chemical species produced in small yield in the particle tracks [34].

The yields of the primary chemical species depend markedly on the type of radiation or, more specifically, on the energy transferred to the solution per unit length along the track of the charged particle. The linear energy transfer (LET) parameter varies from 5 x 10^4 keV per micron of path for fission recoils to 0. 2 keV/micron for fast electrons. The yields G(H2) and G(H2O2) are largest for radiations such as fission recoils with large LET, while the yields G(H) and G(OH) are largest for radiations such as fast electrons with small LET.

Reactions (3-2) and (3-3) provide a chain mechanism for the back reaction of Hz and H2O2 to reform water, thereby leading to steady-state concentrations of decomposition products. Reactions (3-4) and (3-5) provide a mechanism for decomposing H2O2 to O2, and reactions (3-3), (3-5), (8-6), and (3-7) provide a mechanism for combining He and O2 to form water at higher temperatures. Dissolved materials may be oxidized or reduced. In general, H atoms usually reduce the solute, and OH radicals reoxidize it. Assuming equal numbers of H and OH, the net result depends on the action of the H2O2. The peroxide may act in either way (depending on the oxidation-reduction potentials) but usually oxidation is favored. In the presence of O2, the H-atom may be converted to HO, which usually acts as an oxidizing agent.

3. 3 Decomposition of water in uranium solutions. In Table 3-2, the hydrogen yields from the decomposition of solutions of various uranyl salts are listed. The yield depends on the type of radiation and the solute concentration but is independent of temperature. Figure 3-18 shows how the yield of hydrogen produced by fission recoil decomposition and by gamma-ray decomposition decreases with increasing uranium concentration. This decrease may result from scavenging of H-atoms in the particle tracks by the uranyl ions. Decomposition by fission recoil particles produces mostly H2 (and an equivalent amount of H2O2 plus O2). The yields G(H) and G(OH) are very small, probably in the range 0 to 0.

Where G is the hydrogen yield in molecules per 100 eV absorbed and W is the power density in kilowatts per liter. The subscripts f, p, and e refer to the values for fission recoil particles, protons produced by neutron scattering, and electrons produced by gamma-ray absorption and by radioactive decay of fission products. For an operating homogeneous reactor, about 96% of the hydrogen gas produced in solution is due to the fission recoil particles, 2% to the neutrons, and 2% to the gamma rays. Therefore, the last two terms in Eq. (3-8) are usually neglected. The fraction due to recoils is usually above 0. 96, since part of the energy of the prompt neutrons, gamma rays, and radioactive decay escapes from the solution. The value of G for a given solute concentration can be obtained from Eq. (3-7), and the value for W can be calculated from the neutron flux, the concentration of fissionable atoms, the fission cross-section, and the kinetic energy of the fission recoils.

Recombination in uranium solutions for fission recoil particles, the radiation-induced back reaction of H₂, O₂, and H₂O₂ is relatively slow. Additionally, the thermal recombination rate in the absence of an added catalyst is relatively slow, leading to a very low steady-state pressure of gases.

Certain solutes, notably copper salts, have been shown to act as homogeneous catalysts in the thermal combination of hydrogen and oxygen in aqueous uranium solutions.

The reaction rate is first order in hydrogen concentration and in copper concentration, and independent of the oxygen concentration. The rate-determining step is the reaction of hydrogen with the catalyst, and the activation energy is about 24 kcal/mole. For a particular uranium solution, the rate of hydrogen removal, in moles/liter/min, can be expressed by where k1 is the first-order rate constant for hydrogen, k2 is the first-order rate constant for copper, and [Cu] is the concentration of copper.

Application of copper sulfate catalyst to the suppression of gas evolution during the operation of the Homogeneous Reactor Experiment was discussed by Visner and Haubenreich. Design calculations for the use of copper catalysts in the HRE-2 and in other reactors have been reported. The use of internal recombination catalysts in homogeneous reactors is also discussed in Article 7-3. 7.

Studies of the kinetics of the thermal decomposition of peroxide in uranyl sulfate solutions have shown the rate to be first order with respect to peroxide concentration in the range from 0. 4 to 5 x 10^7 M, independent of pronounced catalytic effects. The rate of decomposition could be expressed by where k = 2. 9 x 10^6 exp(-23. 5/T) M-1 s-1 and T is the temperature in degrees Celsius.

Where (H2O2) represents total peroxide concentration (UO4- + H2O2) in moles per liter at time t; k is the molar rate constant in the absence of a catalyst; kat is the catalytic constant, and (Cat) is the concentration of the catalyst in moles per liter.

The net rate of peroxide formation is the difference between the rate of production and the rate of decomposition. At the steady state, the two rates are equal. The rate of formation of peroxide in an operating reactor can be expressed in terms of moles per liter per minute as the yield, G, in molecules per 100 eV of fission recoil energy, and the average fission recoil power density of the reactor, W, in kilowatts per liter. This relationship is given by: where kf is the rate constant for the reaction, kd is the rate constant for the reverse reaction, G is the yield of peroxide, W is the average fission recoil power density, and t is time.

Following reactor shutdown, peroxide formation and decomposition will result from the delayed neutrons and from the beta and gamma radiation of the fission products. 46. The yield for radiation-induced decomposition may be as high as 4. 5, but will depend in a complicated way on the amount of oxygen, hydrogen, and other solutes such as fission products, corrosion byproducts, and impurities.

3-3. 6 Decomposition of water in thorium solutions. Under radiation, thorium nitrate solutions decompose to give H2, H2O, and O2 from decomposition of the water, and O2, N2, and oxides of nitrogen from decomposition of the nitrate. Yields of H2 and N2 for several types of radiation, and for several concentrations of thorium nitrate, are given in Table 3-6. The hydrogen yield decreases with increasing solute concentration, the same as for uranium solutions. The N2 is presumably formed by direct action of radiation on the nitrate. The N2 yield is greater for radiations of greater LET. The N2 yield is independent of temperature, and little or no radiation-induced back reaction takes place.

3-4. 1 Introduction. Knowledge of the physical properties of aqueous solutions of reactor fuel materials is required for nuclear physics calculations and analysis of reactor performance, for engineering design, and ultimately for effective reactor operation. The scarcity of information available in 1951 concerning the properties of uranium salt solutions prompted the Homogeneous Reactor Program at ORNL to sponsor a physical properties research program at Mound Laboratory beginning in 3-4. 2 Objectives. The objective of this research program was to determine the thermodynamic and transport properties of aqueous solutions of reactor fuel materials, including uranium, plutonium, and their compounds, as functions of temperature, pressure, and concentration.

3-4. 2 Density of heavy water and uranyl sulfate solutions. An indirect method for determining the density of heavy-water liquid and vapor has been used to extend the data up to the critical temperature. Table 3-7 gives density values at convenient temperature intervals. 0 molal were measured by Jegart, Heiks, and Orban at Mound Laboratory. The densities of uranyl sulfate solutions were measured by Barnett et al. of Mound Laboratory at temperatures up to 250°C for concentrations (at room temperature) of 60. 6 and 101.

The densities of heavy-water solutions of uranyl sulfate reported in Table 3-8 were found to be within 3% of values calculated by this formula. Similar formulas were devised by Tobias for application to the determination of the densities of solutions of mixed solutes such as uranyl sulfate-beryllium sulfate and uranyl sulfate-lithium sulfate. Density information for other uranium salts and for thorium nitrate solutions was compiled by Day, Secoy, and Marshall.

3-4. 3 Viscosity of deuterium oxide and uranium solutions. The viscosity of heavy metal solutions is influenced by several factors, including the concentration, temperature, and ionic strength of the solution. 4-5. 1 Preparation of uranium oxide. The preparation of UO2 by solid-state reaction from UF4 and CO2 has been reported in the literature. In this study, UF4 and CO2 were mixed in a molar ratio of 1:2 and heated at 800°C for 6 h to obtain UO2. 5-6. 1 XRD analysis of uranium oxide. The crystal structure of the obtained UO2 was analyzed by X-ray diffraction (XRD) using Cu Kα radiation. The XRD pattern was recorded on a PANalytical X'Pert PRO MPD system with a scanning range of 5° to 80° at a scan rate of 0. 02°/s. 6-7. A solution containing HNO3, HF, and urea was prepared, and then it was heated at 80°C for 1 h to remove water and obtain a gel. The gel was dried at 120°C for 2 h and calcined at 450°C for 2 h to obtain UO2 thin films. 7-8. 1 Electrical properties of uranium dioxide thin films.

Heiks and Jegart of Mound Laboratory measured the viscosity of uranyl sulfate solutions in light water over a concentration range of 0. 1 to 2. 0 mol/L using Ostwald capillary viscometers. Using the falling-body viscometer referred to above, Barnett et al.

3-4. 4 Heat capacity of uranyl sulfate solutions. Van Winkle [57] estimated the heat capacity of dehydrated uranyl sulfate by comparison with uranyl nitrate and with salts of other metals and has estimated the heat capacity of solutions of uranyl sulfate in heavy water and in light water. The effect of temperature on the heat capacity of solutions was assumed to be the same, percentage-wise, as the effect on the heat capacity of the pure solvent. No experimental measurements have been reported for temperatures above 103°C; values below this temperature differ from the estimates by as much as 10% [57].

Vapor pressure of uranyl sulfate solutions has been measured over the temperature range 24 to 100°C and at uranium concentrations up to 4. 8 molal by Day. The ratio of the vapor pressure of the solution to that of pure water at the same temperature is given in Table 3-4. 5.

The vapor pressure at the same temperature is almost independent of temperature but markedly dependent upon the solute concentration over this range. Table 3-11 shows the effect of uranium concentration upon the ratios at temperatures up to 100°C. Data have, however, not yet been published. Other vapor pressure measurements are being made at the Oak Ridge National Laboratory. The vapor pressure lowering in uranyl sulfate solutions containing added lithium or beryllium sulfate was stated to be approximately in accord with Raoult's law.

3-4. 6 Surface tension of uranyl sulfate solutions. The capillary rise method was adapted to conditions prevailing at elevated temperatures and pressures for measurements made at Mound Laboratory by Heiks et al. Briggs has compiled information on the surface tension of aqueous solutions of uranyl sulfate, including the relationships established between surface tension and concentration, temperature, pressure, and ionic strength.

Barnett et al. , using the apparatus described by Heiks et al. for capillary rise technique at elevated temperatures and pressures, measured the surface tension of light- and heavy-water solutions of uranyl sulfate at temperatures up to 250°C.

3-4. 7 Hydrogen ion concentration (pH). Orban of Mound Laboratory studied the acidity of uranyl sulfate solutions from 25 to 60°C. Secoy has compiled information concerning the effects of uranium sulfate concentration upon pH as reported by a number of investigators. Marshall has utilized the relationship between pH and concentration to determine the solubility of UO3 in sulfuric acid at elevated temperatures. 00°C for various ratios of UOs to sulfate as found by Marshall.

For approximate calculations, the perfect gas laws can be applied to deal with permanent gases under reactor conditions, but values for the properties of water vapor and D2O vapor should be obtained from experimental data or standard tables.

Syracuse University is investigating further the effects of geometry, temperature, and method of ignition on the reaction and detonation limits of H2O-(2H2+ O2). Reaction pressures are also measured. Figure 3-21 shows their reported results in a long 0. 957-in. -diameter tube at 100°C. These are typical of results obtained at 300°C. It is interesting to note that their lower reaction limit is 6% Knallgas, as compared with 20% Knallgas observed by Stephan.

4-1. 1 Introduction. With the inception of the aqueous homogeneous power reactor program at Oak Ridge National Laboratory in 1949, the primary choice of fuel was highly enriched UO2SO4 solution. Use of enriched uranium alleviated to some extent the need for strict neutron economy, but it was found that at high temperature (250 to 300°C) UO2SO4 solutions were more corrosive than pure water and were subject to a high-temperature instability. As a result, a secondary development effort was initiated at ORNL to determine the potentialities of suspensions of solid uranium compounds as reactor fuels. The principal efforts were directed at forms of UO3, because it was believed that under reactor operating conditions the trioxide would be the stable oxidation state. Considerable progress was made in studies of the oxide and its slurries, and in the development of equipment for circulating the slurries at concentrations of several hundred grams per liter in 100-gpm loops at 250°C. In addition, a criticality study was carried out with enriched UO3 + H2O in water to obtain assurance that local fluctuations in concentration or settling would not unduly affect nuclear stability.

In 1955, the UO3 work was set aside so that effort could be concentrated on ThO2 suspensions, which are at present believed to be the only suitable fluid homogeneous fertile material for use in an aqueous homogeneous thorium breeder. The ultimate goal of this effort at ORNL has been set at a two-region, ThO2, homogeneous, power breeder.

In the following sections of this chapter, a detailed account is given of studies on UO2 slurries and ThO2 slurries, and a description of their production, properties, and utilization. The discussion will be based largely on work done in the United States, but it should be kept in mind that studies on fuel- and fertile-material suspensions have been conducted in other countries—in particular, in the Netherlands and in Great Britain—and that exchanges of concepts and data have aided the US efforts.

4-1. 2 Types of suspensions and their settled beds. Two-phase systems of solids in liquids may be classified in several ways. On the basis of the size of the particles, a phase is said to be colloidal when it is sufficiently finely divided to permit the surface attraction forces of the particles to exert a strong influence on the mechanical properties of the material as a whole. If, in addition, the particles are dispersed in a liquid and are sufficiently small so they diffuse throughout the liquid due to their Brownian motion in a normal gravitational field, they are referred to as sols. Sols are not resolved in an ordinary microscope but are usually recognizable in an ultramicroscope. The particles of a sol are usually less than 0. 05 micron. Particles in a sol may join to form a random network of some strength having a semisolid appearance and called a gel, or they may coalesce into loose and relatively independent clouds of joined particles referred to as flocs. Suspensions of flocs or of particles which are large enough to settle are referred to as slurries.

In some sols, the particles are stabilized by the preferential attraction of the suspending liquid to the particles' surface. These are referred to as lyophilic sols. In other sols, the thermodynamically stable condition is a flocculated or a gelled state, but the particles are held apart by electrostatic forces produced by ions which collect on and near the surface of the particles.

Although dispersions having particle sizes greater than 0. 5 microns do not form sols, since they are too large and have too large a mass to be appreciably affected by Brownian motion, the particle surfaces may exhibit some colloidal properties which are most pronounced when the particles are very close together.

When slurries having particles that are either relatively large or have a high ionic charge on their surface (and hence have little tendency to flocculate) settle, the settled bed density approaches about 50 to 70%. The bed may exhibit dilatancy, which means that the bed must expand to be deformed, and the apparent viscosity of the bed increases as the rate of shear increases. These spheres of more than 5 to 10 microns settle to beds of this type.

Joined, and from that point, the particles are in part supported by indirect contact with the walls and bottom of the container through the floc structure. The resulting settled bed may continue to compact indefinitely at a slower and slower rate. Such beds behave more or less in a plastic fashion and may even exhibit a pronounced yield stress (i. e. , shear stress required before an appreciable deformation rate is initiated).

In UO2-H2O slurries of concentrations up to several hundred grams per liter, the yield stress is less than 0. 1 lb/ft, and the slurries are almost Newtonian in character. A breeding blanket requires ThO2 slurries containing 500 to 1500 grams of thorium per liter, and in these concentrations, the yield stress varies from 0 to well over 1 lb/ft, depending in part on the concentration, on the shape and form of the oxide particle, and on the presence or absence of certain additives. Settled beds of both ThO2 and UO3-H2O may be either colloidal and plastic or much more dense, noncolloidal, and apparently dilatant.

4-1. 3 Engineering problems associated with colloidal properties. The colloidal behavior of some slurries offers three types of problems: high yield stress, caking, and sphere-forming tendencies. A high yield stress, in turn, offers three main engineering problems: high velocity required to produce turbulence, a tendency to plug tubes, and a tendency to increase the difficulty of mixing in a large blanket or reactor vessel.

A cake is defined as an accumulation of particles on part of the surface of the system in so dense and rigid a form that it cannot be deformed without fracture.

Caking and mud formation have occasionally occurred in circulation loops, causing plugging of tubes, hydraulic, or mechanical unbalance in a centrifugal pump, and a drastic reduction in heat transfer to or from the walls. These phenomena appear to be due to compaction of flocculated slurry under the influence of stresses due to flow. The rigidity of a cake or mud appears to be inversely related to the particle size.

Muds have been observed in both ThO2 and UO2-H2O platelet slurries. In one case, a 1- to 3-in. layer of ThO2 cake was built up on essentially all parts of a 3-in. 200-gpm circulating system. The cake resembled chalk in strength and consistency. It had a density of about 5. 5 g/cc.

Sphere formation occurs when a circulating slurry contains very fine particles and appears to resemble the formation of a popcorn ball. Spheres ranging in size from about five to several hundred microns in diameter are produced by this process, which is commonly used in mineral processing operations such as flotation.

Diameter has been made. Prolonged circulation causes an equilibrium size to be reached, which depends on the circulating conditions and the starting material. Spheres have been formed from certain types of ThO2 in suspension, but no spheres or cakes have been observed in circulating UO3-H2O. This may be due to the fact that the greater solubility of UO3-H2O prevents its remaining as extremely fine particles.

Plastic materials that exhibit high yield stress require a high velocity before they become turbulent. It is not uncommon for ThOz slurries to require 30-40 ft/sec velocity for the onset of turbulence. It is interesting to note that velocity by itself appears to be the most important criterion for whether a given plastic will be in laminar or turbulent flow—as opposed to the product of tube diameter and velocity, which is the corresponding criterion for a given Newtonian liquid.

Control or elimination of colloidal, flocculating properties of slurries is crucial. Electrolyte additives that attach to particle surfaces may provide such a strong charge that particles cannot approach to form a floc or gel. In true lyophobic sols, the most effective additives are often those that produce ions of atoms or radicals of the same type as those composing the particle. For example, ThO2 or Th(OH)4 sols of up to 4000 g/liter concentration are easily made by the addition of Th(NO3)4 solution to freshly prepared Th(OH)4. On a somewhat similar basis, additives that may form partially ionized or lyophilic surface compounds are often effective. Very small additions of H2C2O4, Na2SiO2, Na3PO4, and NaAlO2 have been found effective at room temperatures in producing free-flowing Newtonian slurries from high-yield-stress ThO2 muds. In most cases, the effect is lost at elevated temperatures. However, coating the particles with a silicone compound and firing to convert it to SiO2 has produced slurries that appear to remain unflocculated at high temperatures.

Resistant to abrasion, but recrystallization in solution is essentially nil. ThO2 produced by calcination of a plate or cube form of Th(C2O4)2 retains the plate or cube form, but the particle is composed of smaller crystals of ThO2. Violent agitation causes crystals in the particles to break apart, after which they are free to exhibit the colloidal behavior of the finer particles. The higher the calcination temperature, the larger the ThO2 crystals. By calcination at 1600°C, crystals in excess of 0. 25 micron are produced, whereas calcination at 650°C gives crystals of 50 to 100 Å. In both cases, the overall particle size may be of the order of 0. 5 to 5 microns. Even the material calcined at the higher temperature exhibits a discouragingly high yield stress; however, at the preferred concentration for a two-region breeder blanket (~1500 g/liter at room temperature). Part of the difficulty may be due to a possible systematic arrangement of charges on the particle surface, which causes actual attraction and binding of particles into an unusually strong floc in a preferred orientation.

If spherical particles are used, the amount of possible common surface between particles is limited, and the permanence of mutual attachment is correspondingly limited. In addition, if the surface is essentially uniform, the charge arrangement might tend to repel rather than attract other particles. Furthermore, a spherical shape permits the particles to be larger without excessive abrasion.

Spheres made in circulating systems, as mentioned above, exhibit Newtonian flow properties at concentrations up to about 3500 to 4000 g/liter at room temperature. At the present time, they are rather friable, although their density is of the order of 8. 5. Calcining the spheres at very high temperatures in furnaces, oxyacetylene flames, or electric arcs gives them considerably greater integrity while retaining their noncolloidal properties. However, at high firing temperatures (1800°C), a tendency of the spheres to break up, owing presumably to internal stresses, has been noted. Dense spheres have been produced in small quantity by spraying a Th(OH)a gel which is subsequently hardened, dried, and fired.

Thus, it appears that the colloidal behavior of ThOs slurries may be minimized through the use of spherical particles, larger particles, coating the particles with silica or some other compound, or by the use of some as-yet-unperfected additive.

4-1. 4 Engineering problems not associated with colloidal properties: Sedimentation. One of the principal noncolloidal problems encountered with suspensions or slurries is sedimentation, which in a flowing system is offset by any upward component of liquid velocity.

Stagnant vessel. In a vertical tube with laminar flow, particles tend to be more concentrated near the center of the tube. One possible explanation may be that the particles spin in the velocity gradient near the wall in a direction which would cause them to move toward the center of the tube as the liquid moves past them. It appears possible that a similar effect could reduce the sedimentation rate in a horizontal tube. In an inclined tube, the solids will collect on the lower side of the tube, while a channel of low solids content will appear along the upper side. The resulting radial variation in density and possibly in viscosity distorts the normal parabolic velocity profile and complicates computation of the local sedimentation rate.

In turbulent flow, fluctuating radial velocities will tend to cause diffusion from more concentrated regions to regions of lower concentration in competition with the settling due to gravity. Although a relatively strong diffusion tendency exists across the bulk of the conduit, the diffusion rather suddenly begins to be damped near the wall, although some random radial velocity fluctuations may occur essentially up to the wall. The distance from the wall at which damping begins to become pronounced is of the order of about 1 mm for water for velocities at 1 ft/sec in tubes larger than about 4 to 4 in. in diameter, and it is generally recognized by hydrodynamicists as being approximately proportional to v/Um where Um is the mean velocity of the fluid and v is the kinematic viscosity, about 10—5 ft2/sec. Since particles in the slurries under discussion are of micron size, rather than large fractions of millimeters, those particles which find themselves well inside this layer above a horizontal surface may tend to build up a sediment which becomes the solid surface from which the more or less damped layer must be measured.

This process can continue until the diameter and velocity are reduced to the point where flow becomes laminar, and the tube is choked off completely, or until the local shear stress becomes high enough to drag the particles along, and an equilibrium bed thickness is approached. Therefore, the mean stream velocity at which sediment tends to accumulate is rather sharply defined for a given slurry.

It follows directly that a slurry, which is flowing horizontally, cannot keep its particles in suspension unless the flow is turbulent, or unless it is an extremely stiff flocculated mud. Even in turbulent flow, a minimum velocity may be required to prevent the accumulation of sediment along the bottom of a tube or conduit. Such sedimentation can occur in a reactor blanket vessel in regions where the net velocity is extremely low.

In the case of thorium slurries rather than uranium slurries, UO3-H2O crystals are relatively soft, and when they strike a stainless-steel wall, they tend to break without damaging the surface of the wall. ThO2 particles, on the other hand, appear to be sufficiently hard to abrade the protective oxide film on stainless steel and perhaps to abrade the base metal. Continuous removal of the film exposes the bare metal to corrosive attack by the hot water and, in some cases, causes very serious damage. The attack is most severe in local recirculation regions associated with flow separation and in regions of sudden acceleration and direction change, such as in orifices, pump impellers, and pump seal rings. Materials such as zirconium and titanium, which form very hard oxide films, and essentially non-corrodible metals such as gold and platinum show more resistance to ThO2 slurries than do stainless steels.

4-1. 5 Systems and components for using slurries in reactors. For example, the overall system should be kept as free of extraneous circuits and secondary lines as possible. If possible, the system should always tend to drain into a sump whenever circulation stops to prevent plugging by settled beds. Smaller side lines should, where possible, be attached to the top of a horizontal run of the main system to allow solids to settle into the mainstream, and a minimum size for smaller lines should be established based on the expected strength of any reasonably conceivable settled bed. In ThOz or UO2 systems, all elbows should be of at least moderately large radius, and sudden constrictions such as orifices should be avoided.

Mechanical pumps for ThO2 or UO2 must be leak-tight and should be capable of handling the hard abrasive particles. This includes adequate hydraulic design, the use of particularly resistant materials in regions of high fluid acceleration or high velocity, and either very abrasion-resistant bearings or essentially complete isolation of the bearings from the slurry. The trim must be unusually abrasion- and corrosion-resistant to ensure continued internal leak-tightness.

Pressure-sensing instruments should not, in general, include long blind passages of small diameters, which might easily become plugged in ThO2 slurries. Flowmeters should not include rapidly moving parts in contact with slurries unless bearings that are not affected by the abrasive action of the solids are used.

All vessels should be provided with a means of resuspending solids which have settled to the bottom. In some vessels, a simple mechanical agitator is sufficient. In others, steam or gas sparging can be used. In still other cases, more sophisticated systems may be required involving, for example, injection of an external liquid or slurry stream to induce strong internal mixing.

Introduction: Preliminary studies on uranium oxide slurries for use in a plutonium-producer reactor were carried out in the period 1940-1944 by Vernon, Hickey, Huffman, and others, first at Columbia University and later at the University of Chicago as a part of the Manhattan Project. This program was discontinued before the feasibility of uranium oxide slurries could be established, but a large backlog of information on the properties and slurry behavior of the uranium oxides was obtained. These studies are reported in detail by Kirschenbaum, Murphy, and Urey in a still-secret volume of the National Nuclear Energy Series (III, 4-B) which should soon be declassified. In 1951, work on the development of uranium oxide slurries was revived, primarily at the Oak Ridge National Laboratory. These studies were terminated in 1953 before a satisfactory slurry was developed. The results are reported by Blomeke and, in a 1955 Geneva paper, by Kitzes and Lyon.

4-2. 2 Chemical stability of uranium oxides. Both the early Manhattan Project work and the ORNL work indicated that uranium trioxide would be the probable stable form of uranium oxide under the radiolytic gas formed by the radiation-induced decomposition of water in a reactor. Uranium dioxide in an aqueous slurry at 250°C was oxidized to uranium trioxide in the presence of oxygen overpressure and even in the presence of excess hydrogen gas. The extent of this oxidation depended on the oxygen pressure and seemed to be independent of the partial pressure of hydrogen (Table 4-1). The extent of oxidation of U3Ox to uranium trioxide depended on both temperature and oxygen pressure. The presence of water vapor inhibited the oxidation reaction at low temperatures but enhanced it at higher temperatures. It was concluded that uranium dioxide would be stable in a reactor under normal operating conditions, except for the possibility of small amounts of uranium trioxide being formed by radiolytic gas oxidation.

Of a partial pressure of hydrogen did not seem to markedly inhibit the oxidation (Table 4-2). When a slurry of UOs - H2O rods prepared by thermal decomposition of uranium peroxide in water was heated at 250°C under varying pressures of hydrogen and oxygen, it was unchanged in the presence of a stoichiometric mixture of hydrogen and oxygen in the ratio of water. It was only very slightly reduced by a tenfold excess of hydrogen over the stoichiometric (Table 4-3). Reduction of the UO3 and U3O8 under pure hydrogen atmospheres was quite slow, although freshly oxidized uranium species formed by treatment of UO2 with peroxide were rather readily reduced with hydrogen [9].

Crystalline modifications of the monohydrate were described: the "a" form, "large six-sided orthorhombic tablets," "small six-sided orthorhombic tablets," rhombic hexagonal rods, and "triclinic crystals with a very complicated x-ray pattern. " The "@" and "6" were stable in water below 185°C, and "@" and "6" above 185°C.

ORNL studies on preparation of uranium oxide hydrates agreed in general with those reported in Ref. 9. The most important exception was the inability to prepare a triclinic crystal resembling the 6-UO3-H2O. Attempts to prepare this modification resulted in the formation of bipyramids or platelets, depending on the conditions. Three allomorphic modifications of the monohydrate were obtained, depending on the mode of preparation and treatment (Figs. 4-1 and 4-2). A rodlet form of UO3-H2O was produced when the anhydrous trioxide, formed by heating uranium peroxide at 300°C, was heated in water at 185 to 300°C. The rodlets were also prepared by autoclaving at 250°C for at least 16 hr a slurry of uranium peroxide containing less than 50 ppm uranyl nitrate as an impurity.

By decomposing uranyl nitrate at 300 to 400°C, it was hydrated at 185 to 300°C. Pulverized uranium trioxide rodlets digested at 200 to 250°C converted to the platelet form, whereas pulverized uranium trioxide platelets digested at 150 to 200°C transformed into rodlets.

The rodlets were bright yellow in color, normally 1 to 5 microns in diameter and 10 to 30 microns long. The platelets were pale yellow in color, 6 to 50 microns on edge and about 1 micron thick. The bipyramids were also pale yellow in color and several hundred microns along each edge.

The rodlets appeared to be the same material as a γ-UO3·H2O reported in Ref. 9 as having an orthorhombic structure. Unfortunately, cell dimensions were not given in this reference, and it was impossible to establish the identity without further questioning. Zachariasen [14] reported the cell dimensions of two different UO3·H2O crystals but gave no information concerning the chemical history of his samples. He indexed both of these structures as orthorhombic and called them α-UO3·H2O and β-UO3·H2O, independently of the nomenclature of Ref. 9. It was established from this that the rods gave the same x-ray diffraction pattern as Zachariasen's α-UO3·H2O and that the platelets had the structure of his β-UO3·H2O.

Slurries of the rodlets were pumped satisfactorily at temperatures below 200°C. Slurries of the platelets, although easily pumped, had a tendency to form soft cakes on the pipe walls at temperatures above 200°C. The influence of the trace quantities of nitrate impurities which remained in the "purified oxides" was not investigated, however.

The solubility of pure UO2 - H2O in pure water is less than 10 ppm at room temperature and is also low at high temperatures. As a result, pure UO2-H2O slurries were essentially neutral. The presence of soluble uranyl salts of strong acids lowered the pH of the slurry; however, and increased the solubility of the oxide. In the preparation of UO3 by the pyrolysis of UO2(NO3)2, for example, residual nitrate could not readily be removed by a simple washing step, and slurries of such oxides released nitrate when the crystals were broken down in a pumping system.

4-2. 5 Zero-power reactor tests. The microscopic inhomogeneity of the enriched rodlet slurry fuel was found to offer no serious difficulty in the operation of a zero-power homogeneous slurry reactor. In this reactor, suspension was established by a propeller-type mixer located near the bottom of the vessel. The reactor was extremely stable at any given stirrer speed. Changing the stirrer speed produced a change in nuclear reactivity, which was attributed to a redistribution of the oxide when the stirrer was moving slowly and to a change in the shape of a vortex-type concavity in the slurry when the stirrer was moving rapidly.

4-3. 1 Selected properties of thorium oxide. Thorium oxide is a white, granular, slightly hygroscopic solid with a fluorite structure. The Chemical Rubber Handbook of Chemistry and Physics gives 10. 03 as the density of thorium. Foex gives pycnometric densities for thorium. 4-3. 2 Thermal conductivity of thorium oxide. Values range from 1. 5 to 2. 0 W/mK at room temperature.

Powders prepared by firing the hydroxide, which increased with increasing X-ray density asymptotically. Foex also noted that the density of a compacted bed of thoria powder (3000 kg/cm pressures) increased with firing temperature but remained much lower than the actual powder densities. The ratio of pycnometric density to bed density changing from powders obtained from oxalate thermal decomposition had pycnometric densities almost identical with those prepared from the hydroxide for the same firing temperature. The melting point of thorium oxide has been reported to be 3050 ± 25°C, and the boiling point has been estimated at 4400°C.

4-3. 2 Preparation of thorium oxide. The principal method of preparing thorium oxide for use in aqueous slurries has been the thermal decomposition of the oxalate. Thorium oxalate, precipitated from thorium nitrate solution, is crystalline, easy to wash and filter, and the oxide product is readily dispersed as a slurry.

This preparation is characterized by a very small particle size, approximately 0. 02 microns, and low bulk density, and very closely resembles the oxide from the thermal decomposition of oxalate after the latter has been pumped at elevated temperatures.

A third method for the preparation of slurry oxide is the thermal decomposition of thorium formate. In this procedure, thorium nitrate in solution is decomposed on adding it to concentrated formic acid at 95°C. The precipitated thorium formate is washed free of excess acid and decomposed by calcination at 500 to 800°C. Because of this, the oxalate preparation method is preferred at the present time.

Experience in the preparation of oxide by the direct calcination of Th(NO3)a is limited. The nitrate decomposes at about 250°C, but firing to 500°C is necessary to remove the last traces of nitrogen oxide decomposition products. The hydrated salt goes through a plastic stage during calcination, and the resulting oxide is sand-like and difficult to slurry.

An interesting method for producing submicron-size thorium oxide directly from thorium nitrate is that developed by Hansen and Minturn. Their method consisted of the combustion of an atomized solution of thorium nitrate in an ethanol-acetone mixture and collection of the resulting thorium oxide smoke.

Micron-size thorium oxide may also be prepared by the hydrothermal decomposition of a thorium nitrate solution at 300°C. The product from the preparation is a free-flowing powder. At temperatures much below 300°C, the rate of hydrolysis is quite slow.

Brief studies made with thorium hydroxide indicated that it is probably not a good source material for the production of slurry oxide. As precipitated from nitrate solution, the hydroxide formed a bulky precipitate which was hard to filter and wash, was amorphous to x-rays, and contained considerable nitrate impurity. Drying at 300 to 500°C yielded a crystalline oxide product which was difficult to slurry. Autoclaving a slurry of the hydroxide (without previous drying) at 250°C gave a bulky slurry (settled volume 300 to 500 g Th/liter) exhibiting a characteristic ThO2 x-ray pattern.

Thorium oxalate process for the recovery of thorium from monazite sand. The process involves the precipitation of thorium as an oxalate, followed by its dispersion in water and separation of the insoluble residue by filtration. The filter cake is washed with water to remove soluble impurities, then dried and calcined to form a high-purity oxide suitable for use in nuclear fuel production.

Solutions of thorium nitrate and oxalic acid are mixed in an agitated tank with controlled temperature, addition rate, and order of addition. In the first step, all the thorium nitrate is added to the precipitator; after which the oxalic acid solution is added over a period of 3 hr with the reagents held at 10°C by external cooling. The slurry of precipitated thorium oxalate is digested for 6 hr at 75°C and then pumped to a vacuum filter where the solid is separated from the mother liquor and washed three times with demineralized water. The oxalate cake on the filter is air-dried and is then loaded on trays for the first calcination.

Before the supernatant is decanted, coarse material (5 to 7 microns) is separated by setting the supernatant withdrawal rate at 0. 5 in. /min liquid level drop. The withdrawn thorium oxide is dispersed and decanted again twice to ensure removal of oversized particles. This procedure removes nearly all the thorium oxide smaller than 5 microns, and the final product contains only 1 or 2% of particles greater than 5 microns. This material is then refired at 650°C to decompose the oxalic-acid dispersant before being used in engineering studies.

Oxide prepared in this way has an average particle size of 1 to 3 microns and handles well in high-temperature engineering loop tests at slurry concentrations as high as 1500 g Th/kg H2O. Removal of the oversize particles has decreased the erosive attack on loop components to essentially what would be observed with water alone. Lower-yield-stress slurries are obtained with the larger particles.

Previous engineering experience with slurries of oxides prepared similarly but with final firings at 650 and 800°C showed them to possess an extremely high yield stress at concentrations greater than 750 g Th/kg H2O and an occasionally bad caking characteristic.

4-3. 4 Characterization of thorium oxide products. Although thorium oxide is a very refractory substance, it is well known that such properties as its density, catalytic activity, and chemical inertness depend on the conditions of its formation. With particular references to preparation from the oxalate, the firing temperature has a marked effect on the ease of formation of colloids [38]. Beckett and Winfield [25] concluded from electron micrographs of oxide residues that the initial oxalate crystal imposes on the residual oxide a mosaic structure of thin, spongy, microcrystalline laminae all oriented in very nearly the same direction.

Oxide products from thorium oxalate decomposition are normally characterized by their behavior as slurries. In addition, they have been characterized by means of electron micrograph pictures, their nitrogen adsorption surface areas, particulate properties as measured by sedimentation analysis, and X-ray diffraction methods.

Effect of preparation variables on the particulate properties of thorium oxide. The effects of thorium oxalate precipitation temperature, calcination temperature, and calcination time on oxide properties were initially investigated by Allred, Buxton, and McBride. Oxalate was precipitated at 10, 40, 70, and 100°C from a 1 M thorium-nitrate solution by dropwise addition of oxalic acid solution and vigorous stirring. The precipitates for 24 hours. Electron micrographs of the oxide products showed particles of the approximate size and shape of the original oxalate particles from which they were formed. The particles of oxide prepared from 10°C-precipitated material were approximately 1 micron in size and appeared quite uniform; those from the 40°C material were 1 to 2 microns in size and less uniform. A marked increase in particle size was observed for the oxide particles prepared from the 70°C- and 100°C-precipitated materials, which were 4 to 7 microns in size. There was no change in particle shape or average particle size and no evidence of sintering as the firing temperature was increased from 400 to 900°C.

Table 4-4 shows typical data obtained with the 10°C-precipitated material. Included in Table 4-4 are the results of additional firings up to 1600°C. No increase in average particle size was noted even up to 1600°C. However, in all oxide preparations, there was about 10 w/o above 5 microns in particle size.

A radioactivation method for sedimentation particle-size analysis of ThO2 was allowed to settle past a scintillation counter connected to a count-rate meter and a recorder. The scintillation activity, being proportional to thoria concentration, was analyzed in the usual manner, using Stokes' law, to give the size distribution data. Independently, an analogous method for use with UO2 powders was developed at Argonne National Laboratory.

The x-ray crystallite (as opposed to the actual oxide particle, which may be composed of a great many crystallites in an ordered or disordered pattern) is defined as the smallest subdivision of the solid which scatters x-rays coherently. The crystallite size can, in principle, be determined from the width of the x-ray diffraction peak, the width being greater the smaller the average crystallite size.

Additional studies on the effects of the chemical and physical variables of the batch oxalate precipitation step on the particulate properties of thorium oxide from oxalate thermal decomposition were carried out by Pearson et al. In addition to precipitation temperature, the effect of reagent concentration, stirring rate, reagent addition rate, and digestion time were investigated. Most of the precipitations were made by adding oxalic acid solution to the thorium nitrate solution, which appeared to give an oxide product of smaller average size and fewer oversize particles than the reverse.

In these experiments, it was found that the conditions for producing oxide with uniform particles of 1-micron average size and a low percentage of particles greater than 5 microns were 1M Th(NO3)4 and H2C2O4 concentrations, a 10°C precipitation temperature, a high rate of oxalic acid addition, and vigorous stirring.

It is common practice to present the particle-size distribution in the form of a plot of the logarithm of the particle size versus the cumulative weight percent undersize on a scale based on the probability integral. If the particle-size data follow a logarithmic probability distribution (as they usually do reasonably well for most ThO2 preparations), the resulting plot is a straight line, and the steeper the slope of the line, the less uniform the material. The 50% size in such a plot is the geometric mean particle diameter (d50). The geometric standard deviation size [44].

Effect of preparation variables on x-ray crystallite size and specific surface areas of thorium oxide from oxalate thermal decomposition. The product of the surface area in m/g and the crystallite diameter in angstroms, at least for oxide fired at ≥900°C, was approximately constant and equal to 3. 6 X 103.

Where D is the crystallite diameter, t the time, and T the absolute temperature, A, B, and C are constants. The constant a appears to be characteristic of oxide prepared by the thermal decomposition of thorium oxalate. For D in angstroms and t in hours, the equation becomes.

Oxides from the hydrothermal decomposition of thorium oxalate. The precipitation temperature of the oxalate had no effect on the final shape or size, and all evidence of the original oxalate structure had disappeared. Sedimentation particle-size analyses indicated particle sizes between 0. 5 and 1 micron.

The hydrothermal oxides were composed of crystallites 200 Å in size, which did not grow on subsequent firing at temperatures up to 900°C. Furthermore, the specific surface area of the hydrothermally prepared oxide decreased less with increasing firing temperature than did the surface area of the oxide from oxalate thermal decomposition and was much larger for the higher firing temperatures (-6).

Effect of high-temperature water on oxide properties. Prolonged heating in water at temperatures up to 300°C did not change the crystallite size, bulking properties, or abrasiveness of thorium hydroxide calcined at 500 and 650°C [45]; and tests showed no evidence of hydrate formation [46, 47]. Lack of crystallite growth probably indicates an extremely low solubility of thorium oxide in water at 300°C. When at 300°C in the presence and absence of as much as 10,000 ppm of SO4 (pH about 2), there was no increase in the average sedimentation particle size or x-ray crystallite size [49].

Effect of pumping on oxide properties: Oxides with particle sizes much greater than 1 micron are degraded to an average particle size much less than 1 micron on pumping at elevated temperatures, while oxides composed of cubic particles of about 1 micron show little change. Surface area increases from 16 m/g to 30 m/g have been noted for some pumped oxides, the latter figure being almost the theoretical maximum for the measured x-ray crystallite size.

Pumping does not affect the average X-ray crystallite size of slurry oxides. Also, oxides which have been pumped as slurries, dried, and then calcined show relatively little crystallite growth. From these considerations, it would seem that the crystallite size as measured by X-ray diffraction line broadening represents the ultimate limit of the attrition process due to pumping.

While most of the pumped slurries have been slow-settling, composed of small particles (≈1 micron), and have yielded bulky sediments, on occasion, the small particles resulting from the attrition of the original slurry particles reagglomerated to form large spheres 10 to 50 microns in size. This resulted in a slurry that settled rapidly to a dense but easily resuspended bed. Sphere formation appeared to be the property of specific oxide preparations and was observed most often with 800°C-fired material. Preparing the oxide in a particle size that does not degrade on pumping (≈1 micron) and firing at 1600°C to improve particle stability appears, in the initial pumping studies, to have largely removed the problem.

Of a dispersing agent exhibit "hindered settling. " All particles settle at a constant rate, and there is a well-defined interface between the suspended particle and the supernatant. This form of settling is called "hindered" because there is mutual interference of the particles in their motion, and Stokes' law does not apply to the settling of each particle.

Usually, three zones of settling are observed: the initial zone during which the motion of the interface from its initial level is uniform (hindered settling) and rapid; a compressive zone during which the motion of the interface is also uniform but much slower; and a final stationary state. The first settling zone terminates when the interface reaches the settled mass of flocs. The slurry concentration (grams of thorium per liter) at the point of transition between the initial settling zone and the compressive zone is termed the critical density or the critical concentration. The compressive zone is characteristic of a flocculated material and shows the rate of compaction of the settled bed.

Room-temperature sedimentation characteristics. The room-temperature hindered-settling rates (for a given slurry concentration), critical concentrations, and settled concentrations of thorium oxide slurries (unpumped) all increased with increasing firing temperature up to 1000°C of the oxide. In addition, the hindered-settling rates also increased with decreasing slurry concentration. It should be noted that all slurries are in compaction in the 500 to 800 g Th/kg H2O concentration range.

Table 4-5 shows the combined effects of slurry temperature and oxide calcination temperature on the hindered-settling rate, Uo[50]. From theoretical considerations, the product Uo should remain constant for an oxide over a series of settling temperatures, provided that no change has occurred in the particulate or dispersive characteristics of the oxide. The trend appears to reverse with the 1300°C-fired material, which also shows a larger change in the Uou product with temperature than do the lower-fired materials.

High-temperature sedimentation characteristics. Slurry settling rates at temperatures in excess of 100°C have been obtained in quartz tubes 8 mm in diameter. These data, obtained with a slurry of thorium oxide prepared by a 650°C calcination of thorium formate, indicated that the slurry was already in the compaction zone of settling above no settling occurred at temperatures above 100°C.

Data on the sedimentation characteristics of thorium oxide slurries at elevated temperatures in stainless-steel autoclaves, with an inside diameter of 1 in. , have been obtained by an x-ray absorption technique. Standard x-ray film was transported at a controlled speed past a vertical slot in a lead shield behind which a bomb containing the settling slurry and an x-ray source were placed.

The combined effects of temperature and particle size on slurry settling rates for 250 g Th/kg H2O slurries of oxides fired at 800 to 900°C are shown in Fig. 9. Since the systems were flocculated, the hindered settling rates are much greater than those predicted from the mean particle sizes by a simple application of Stokes' law. The settling rate-temperature dependence curve for the slurries containing the larger particles closely paralleled the curve for the fluidity of water. Hence, it may be assumed that for these slurries little or no change occurred in the flocculating characteristics with increasing slurry temperature.

The effect of slurry concentration on the settling characteristics of a slurry at elevated temperatures is illustrated in Figure 10. The bulk of this slurry (>80 wt%) was made up of spherical agglomerates 10 to 15 microns in size. The data indicate that the slurry settling rate is an exponential function of the concentration and has the form where K is a constant related to the specific gravity of the solids and C is the concentration of the slurry (in wt%).

Where Up is the measured settling rate, U is the settling rate at infinite dilution where Stokes' law should govern the particulate settling, C is the slurry concentration, and a is the slope of the logarithmic settling rate-slurry concentration curve. Extrapolating the straight-line portion of the curves to zero concentration and assuming an agglomerate density of 5. 0 g/cc, Stokes' law particle diameters were calculated at the various temperatures and were found to be approximately the same, again illustrating a lack of change in slurry flocculation characteristics with increasing slurry temperature. The calculated particle diameters at 100, 150, and 200 are those obtained by sedimentation particle-size analysis in dilute suspension.

The effects of oxide firing temperatures of 900 and 1600°C on slurry settling rates at elevated temperatures are shown in Figure 11. Slurry concentrations were 250 g Th/kg H2O, and the oxide was prepared from the 10°C-precipitated oxalate (cubic particles, ~1 micron). Settling data obtained on the slurries after they had been pumped at elevated temperatures are also included. The slurry of higher-fired material shows much higher settling rates. Pumping does not greatly affect the settling rates of slurries of either oxide above 150°C. The temperature dependence of settling rates roughly follows the change in water fluidity, but the curve for the 1600°C-fired pumped material deviates considerably below 150°C and is much flatter.

Effect of additives on settling rates: The fluidity of concentrated non-Newtonian slurries can be increased by the use of additives. Of particular importance is a knowledge of the effect of temperature on the action of such additives. Both sulfate and sodium silicate additions, either as thorium sulfate or sulfuric acid, were investigated and found to change markedly the settling rates and handling characteristics of thoria slurries, the relative effect of any additive concentration on a given slurry depending on the slurry temperature.

Sodium silicate is a well-known deagglomerator as well as a wetting agent. Its addition to thick concentrated slurries at room temperature increases their fluidity to that approaching water. It also markedly improves their heat-transfer properties for certain flow conditions.

An abnormal increase in the hindered-settling rate in the temperature region of 150 to 200°C was obtained upon the addition of between 2000 and 3000 ppm of sulfate.

Also appearing in -12 is the sulfuric acid titration curve obtained with the standard slurry. It should be noted that the sulfate concentration regions of temperature instability bracket the break in the pH curve, and the region of temperature stability occurs between pH 6 and 7.

Figure 4-13 shows the effect of sodium metasilicate additions on the settling rate at elevated temperatures of a 250g Th/kg H2O slurry of 800°C-fired oxide, which had been micropulverized to an average particle size of 1 micron. At silica concentrations of 5000 to 30,000 parts SiO2 per million ThO2, the settling rates are reduced (by comparison with the pure slurry) at all temperatures up to 250°C, but the effect is more pronounced at the lower temperatures.

Slurry temperature. The more pronounced effects are observed at temperatures below 200°C. Above 250°C, the effect of the additive becomes less pronounced and sometimes even negligible from the point of view of its effect on the settling rate. It may be, however, that at high temperatures the additive could change the viscous properties of the slurry in a dynamic system and not affect its settling rate in a quiescent state (essentially zero shear stress) at the same temperature.

Study of the preparation variables has indicated that a considerable control can be exercised over the properties of the slurry oxide. Little is known as to what physical and chemical properties of thorium oxide are important in determining its handling characteristics in water at high temperatures, and studies are being made to determine these properties. Sulfate and silicate additives have been shown in settling studies to have a marked effect on the dispersion characteristics of slurries at temperatures below 200°C, but at reactor temperatures, the effect of the additive on the settling rate diminishes and may be negligible. The effect of additives on the rheological properties of slurries at reactor temperatures has not yet been determined.

4-4. 1 Introduction. The major difference in descriptions of the engineering properties of aqueous suspensions (compared with aqueous solutions) arises from the fact that suspensions may exhibit either Newtonian or non-Newtonian laminar-flow characteristics. The consequences of the possibility of these two different types of behavior modify conventional heat transfer, fluid flow, and sedimentation correlations, and are important in the design of large systems for handling slurries.

The magnitude of the effects that can be observed with non-Newtonian slurries is illustrated in [59], where the critical velocity for the onset of turbulence is shown to be a strong function of the slurry yield stress and almost independent of the coefficient of rigidity and pipe diameter. The usefulness of laminar-flow measurements in characterizing different suspensions, as well as the application of these constants to a variety of correlations, will be given in the following sections.

4-4. 2 Physical properties. The heat capacity of suspensions of solids is commonly taken as the sum of the heat capacity on a weight basis of the liquid and the solid at the bulk mean suspension temperature, each multiplied by its respective weight fraction in the suspension [60]. Specific-heat values for pure thorium and uranium oxides are given in Table 4-6. 4-4.

For the electrical conductivity of a two-phase system, this equation was subsequently used to correlate conductivity data for suspensions of solids in a gel. However, the thermal conductivity of suspensions has not been shown to be independent of the rate of shear.

Suspensions of solids in liquids may be either Newtonian or non-Newtonian, depending primarily on particle size and electrolyte atmosphere around the particles. Newtonian and non-Newtonian materials are classified and compared by means of shear diagrams in which the rate of shearing strain, dv/dr, is plotted against the shear stress, τ. 15; the viscosity being given by: where K is the viscosity constant and η is the viscosity. 16.

Of the particles. Einstein's treatment for dilute suspensions has been extended by Guth and Simha [74], Simha [75], de Bruyn [76], Saito [77], Vand [78], and Happel [79] to suspensions of higher concentrations. In all these treatments, the hydrodynamic interaction between particles was considered, the extension usually taking the form of terms proportional to ¢ and ¢°, the terms to be added to the Einstein term 2. 5. These results are summarized in Table 4-7.

The viscosities of suspensions of UO3-H2O rods and platelets with uranium concentrations up to 250 g/liter were measured using a modified Saybolt viscometer at temperatures from 30 to 75°C.

Considered mutual hydrodynamic interaction and collisions between particles and pairs of particles. Very dilute. Sulfur sols. As2Sz3 sols. Glass spheres in water. Glass spheres in ZnI2 and water-glycerol solutions.

Ref. 87 was used to determine the value of the shape factor F in Eq. (4-4), which was derived for rod-shaped particles. The value of F for the UO3 - H2O data is 2. 4 ± 0. 7, corresponding to an L/D of about 14 (from Table 4-8). This agrees very well with the dimensions reported for the rodlets of from 1 to 5 microns diameter and 10 to 30 microns long [87].

If it is assumed that the particles in a flocculated non-Newtonian slurry stick together in the form of loose, irregular, three-dimensional clusters in which the original particles can still be recognized, and further that the yield stress is a manifestation of the breaking of these particle-particle bonds, then for constant isotropic bond strength, the yield stress should be proportional to the cube of the volume fraction solids.

The text has been successfully corrected for spelling and grammar mistakes: ". on a log-log plot, as suggested by the plausibility arguments given above. Therefore, the data of Table 4-10 were plotted as 7,D2 versus volume fraction solids. All points fell within the two lines shown in -16. It is believed that the spread of data is largely due to effects of the electrolyte atmosphere [89], since the deviations from the mean particle size were similar. The influence of small quantities of electrolyte on the yield stress of a particular ThOs slurry [92] is shown in -17. ".

Preliminary measurements of rheologic properties of ThO2 slurries at temperatures up to 290°C indicate that the yield stress is essentially independent of temperature, whereas the coefficient of rigidity decreases with temperature, although not to the same extent as water.

And the turbulent Newtonian friction curve on a Fanning friction factor-Reynolds number plot, provided that the Reynolds number is defined as DVρ/n. The usefulness of the Hedstrom concept has been demonstrated by several investigators. Figure 4-18 is a plot of the solution of Eqs.

Parent viscosity. Alves, Boucher, and Pigford indicate that, in the absence of data, the conventional friction-factor plot may be used to predict turbulent pressure drop to within +25%, provided that the Reynolds number is evaluated by using the coefficient of rigidity or viscosity at infinite shear and that the density is taken as that of the slurry. However, it has been shown that a large amount of turbulent pressure-drop data taken with both Newtonian and non-Newtonian slurries can be correlated using the usual friction factor-Reynolds number plot provided the density is taken as that of the slurry and the viscosity as that of the suspending medium. Data obtained with two different ThOs slurries using three different tubes are shown in Figure 19.

Vanoni, who reviewed the literature on sedimentation transportation mechanics through 1953, has pointed out that although a quantitative description of the phenomena was unavailable at that time, it was clear that sediment movement is intimately associated with turbulence. Subsequent work has either been largely of an empirical nature or has unquestioningly accepted and used generalized flow relations that have been developed for homogeneous Newtonian fluids. Undoubtedly, the presence of particulate matter in the flowing stream will exert a perturbing influence on the flow pattern at velocities near drop-out, and a quantitative solution to the problem must include at least an estimate of this effect.

It has been proposed that the velocity below which particulate matter will be deposited on the bottom of horizontal pipes from a Bingham plastic suspension corresponds to the critical velocity for the onset of turbulence. This velocity may be calculated approximately by setting the modified Reynolds number (obtained by using the apparent viscosity Ma = (1+ geDr/6nV) from Eq.

Hindered-settling systematics. The hindered-settling velocity of slurries may be expressed as a coefficient times the Stokes law settling rate. Table 4-12 summarizes typical coefficients obtained in theoretical and empirical investigations. A plot of these coefficients versus porosity showed that they are substantially in agreement.

Settling-rate data obtained in inclined tubes showed a maximum at an angle of about 50° from the vertical, with typical results being given. The spread in the data is largely due to the difficulty in discerning an interface due to supernate rushing upward as the thoria settles out.

44. 5 Heat transfer. Grigull has presented a theoretical treatment of heat transfer to pseudoplastic and Bingham plastic non-Newtonian fluids for laminar flow through tubes.

Experimental data are in substantial agreement with Eq. (4-20). The principal uncertainty in non-Newtonian heat transfer in the transition and turbulent region is the criterion for the onset of turbulence and range of the transition region. Data taken in fully developed turbulent flow with a variety of solid-liquid suspensions may be correlated satisfactorily with the Dittus-Boelter equation (or variations of it), with some uncertainty about the best viscosity to use in the correlation.

Figure 4-21 provides experimental data for heat transfer to the ThO2 slurry with which the pressure-drop measurements of -19 were made. The transition region then extends to Reynolds numbers a factor of four or five greater than the critical, as is the case with Newtonian materials. Heat transfer to ThO2 slurries in fully developed turbulent flow is the same as that predicted by the usual Newtonian correlations to within the precision of the experimental data.

4-5. 1 Introduction. The purpose of constructing the HRE-2 slurry blanket test facility was to determine whether the blanket system installed in the HRE-2 for use with solutions could be used with slurry and, if so, what modifications would be required. The facility, often referred to as the blanket mockup, was a full-scale replica of the HRT blanket circulating system with respect to the reactor-vessel dimensions, piping size, circulating pump, and heat-exchanger tubing size. The pressurizer and piping configurations were not the same, and the high-pressure heat exchanger contained only one-fifth as many tubes as the HRE-2 heat exchanger. A general view during the last stages of construction is shown in Figure 4-5.

The system was divided into a high-pressure and a low-pressure section since the reactor vessel available was a steel prototype, good for only a few hundred psi and could not be used during circulation and heat transfer tests at high pressure. A schematic drawing of the slurry blanket mockup system is given. The slurry stream entered the 60-in. -diameter mockup pressure vessel (which contained a stainless steel replica of the HRE-2 core) through two inlet nozzles arranged to direct the flow in opposite directions on either side of the core inlet, with the expectation that the flow pattern in the blanket would consist of two vortices that would rotate in opposite directions in parallel vertical planes, thus preventing deposition of sediment on the bottom of the pressure vessel. The slurry was removed at the top of the vessel by putting a shroud around the core outlet and removing the fluid through this shroud. It was also expected that as the slurry moved across the top of the core vessel to the shrouded outlet, the rotating motion produced by the inlet nozzles would set up a free vortex in a horizontal plane, the accompanying increase in angular velocity of the fluid as it moved toward the axis tending to sweep the top of the core vessel free of solids. The design of the inlet and outlet nozzles was based on successful tests with an 18-in.

Model of the vessel [146]. Slurry leaving the pressure vessel flowed to the circulating pump, a Westinghouse type 230A canned-motor pump having a design point of 230 gpm at 50-ft head and a working pressure of 2000 psi, which produced a pipeline velocity of 10 ft/sec at its nominal capacity. From the pump, the slurry stream entered the pressurizer, a 6-in. schedule-160 vertical pipe, with an overall height of 14 ft 0 in. above the inlet.

Baffles were installed above the inlet to damp out any vortices. System pressure was maintained by a 10-kW heater located just below the liquid line on the top of the pressurizer. Slurry flowed to the bottom of the mockup pressure vessel from the pressurizer. The main loop auxiliaries consisted of a slurry feed system and a letdown and dump system, which provided system versatility during startup and shutdown. A detailed description of the system is given in reference 145.

At 170°C and 200°C, it was observed that a scale-up relying on maintaining equal superficial vertical velocity at the equator and equal inlet nozzle velocities was insufficient to sustain a uniform suspension. At 170°C, a distinct concentration gradient was evident, and beyond 180°C, the majority of the slurry charge essentially remained stagnant in the blanket, while a rather dilute slurry circulated through the piping loop.

Although these changes are relatively minor in nature, they resulted in a significant improvement in blanket operation. Hydraulic measurements with water showed that the loop flow was increased from 230 to 350 gpm, the head developed was increased from 50 to 56 ft of fluid, the pressure drop through the blanket went from 7. 3 to 33 ft of fluid, and the loss across the blanket inlet nozzles went from 5. 5 to 25 ft of fluid. During system operation at 200°C with a slurry made from ThOz calcined at 800°C, samples were withdrawn from 36 different locations in the blanket vessel. The mean value of the concentration was 610 g Th/kg H2O with a deviation at the 95% level of 75 g Th/kg H2O. The average concentration of the loop circulating stream was 647 g Th/kg H2O, and an average blanket vessel concentration of 655 g Th/kg H2O was obtained from a gamma-ray transmission scan of the vessel. Only about 40 kg (out of a total charge of 1000 kg) was unaccounted for by inventory on the system at this time. This material appeared to be more or less stagnant in the blanket region on top of the core vessel and at the bottom of the pressure vessel.

Addition of uranium tracer to the circulating stream indicated that 10 to 15 kg of ThO2 was immobilized in the blanket and was only slowly mixing with the circulating stream. This was supported by examination of the slurry remaining in the system at the conclusion of the test. A pure white layer, containing no uranium, was found to be partially covered over with a yellow layer containing a substantial quantity of uranium. Both layers were found on the top of the core vessel.

Characteristics similar to those in the initial tests. Reduction of the frequency to 42 cycles with a blanket temperature of 190°C gave a circulating concentration of 265 versus 625g Th/kgH2O0 charged. The blanket samples averaged 495 g Th/kg H20.

Operation of the steam sparging system during the dumping operation at the end of the run allowed recovery of all but 50 liters of the slurry from the blanket (total blanket volume, 1600 liters), compared with about 200 liters remaining at the end of the dump after the initial tests.

During operation with redesigned inlet nozzles, a number of experiments were run in which the pump was shut down for periods up to 3 hours. In every case, the slurry settled rapidly to a concentration of approximately 800 g Th/liter and then gradually compacted to a concentration of approximately 1500 g Th/liter. On restarting the pump, no difficulty was experienced in resuspending the slurry, and the original slurry distribution was re-established in approximately 2 minutes. This proved to be one advantage of operating with a highly flocculated ThO2 slurry compared with operation with a deflocculated slurry that would settle to much more dense beds that are correspondingly more difficult to resuspend.

4-6. 1 Introduction. Experiments have been carried out at the Oak Ridge National Laboratory as part of a continuing program to determine the effect of radiation on the physical properties of aqueous suspensions of thorium oxide. Since changes in particle size, surface properties, and viscosity of the suspension might have a deleterious effect on the operability of a homogeneous-reactor slurry system, these properties were examined. 5-6. 1 Experimental Procedure.

Suspensions of thorium oxide and thorium oxide containing 0. 5 mole % fission products per cm^2 sec have been prepared and irradiated with neutrons. Although more than 40 irradiations were carried out, no significant changes in the properties studied were noted.

4-6. 2 Experimental technique. The experiments were carried out in small, cylindrical, stainless steel autoclaves such as shown in Figure 24. Thermocouples welded into the bottom closure and a 20-mil-ID steel capillary in the top permitted a continuous measurement of temperature and pressure. Continuous stirring was accomplished by means of a dashpot type stirrer of Armco iron clad with stainless steel, with a stainless steel stirring head.

The stirrer was made to reciprocate at 3 to 4 cycles/second by alternately energizing two solenoid coils of double glass-insulated aluminum wire wrapped around the autoclave body. The timing unit consisted of a multivibrator circuit whose frequency of oscillation and cycle time division could be controlled by varying resistances in the circuit. The timer unit, in turn, controlled the grids of two pairs of thyratrons which furnished power to the solenoids. Stirrer operation was monitored by a tickler coil connected to an oscilloscope.

Thermocouples and pressure capillary. During reactor shutdown, the autoclaves were maintained at 300°C by the heat generated by the stirring coils. Heat was removed during reactor operation by air which flowed down the tube, over the autoclave, and back through the annulus provided by the double-walled tube.

The uranium-bearing oxides were prepared by wet-autoclaving mixtures of ThO2 and UO2 (about 90% enriched uranium) at 300°C or by coprecipitating thorium and uranous oxalates and calcining to the oxide. The autoclaves were loaded with 5 ml of slurry at room temperature, which expanded to fill half of the autoclave at 300°C. When uranium-bearing slurries were irradiated, either palladium oxide or molybdenum oxide was added to catalyze the recombination of radiolytic hydrogen and oxygen (see Section 4-7). In some experiments, an oxygen overpressure of 200 to 250 psi was added at room temperature.

Viscosity measurement. The versatility of the timing device described above made possible the measurement of relative slurry viscosity both in-pile and out-of-pile. It was found that the time it takes the stirrer to reach its maximum height for a fixed solenoid current is dependent on the viscosity of the autoclave contents. The "rise time" was determined by adjusting the frequency and load division so that the upper solenoid was de-energized the instant the oscilloscope indicated that the stirrer had reached the top of its travel. The rise time in seconds was then obtained by dividing the load division by the frequency.

4-6. 3 Irradiation results. Viscosities, x-ray crystallite sizes, particle size, and settled concentrations appeared unaffected by the irradiation, as indicated by the data shown in Table 4-13. Measurements made on irradiated and non-irradiated materials were the same within the limits of error. The mean particle sizes were in general not changed significantly; however, in two cases, involving samples cooled for 10 and 11 months, a large increase in mean particle size was observed. It is possible that the long cooling period allowed hard agglomerates to form, which were not broken up by the brief shaking prior to the opening of the autoclaves. One experiment cooled 12 months did not show an agglomeration effect. In general, the irradiated slurries poured readily from the autoclave, and no tendency toward caking was observed, even on samples irradiated in a settled condition for 10 days.

Total corrosion product pickup was similar to that obtained in out-of-pile experiments, except with the slurries containing sulfate, which showed higher corrosion product pickup under irradiation. All of the iron and most of the nickel and chromium were associated with the slurry solids.

4-7. 1 Introduction. Radiolytic decomposition of the aqueous phase of a thorium oxide slurry blanket will produce a stoichiometric mixture of deuterium and oxygen which must be recombined. Total recombination may be accomplished externally to the blanket system by suitable methods. It would be advantageous, however, to recombine the gases internally to minimize both reactor control problems accompanying bubble formation and engineering problems associated with external recombination. The magnitude of the internal-recombination reaction desired may be judged from the estimate that an aqueous thorium oxide-uranium slurry breeding blanket may produce from 2 to 3 moles of H2 and 1 to 1. This is within a factor of 2 of the decomposition one would expect for a solution at the same power density.

Work on the development of a catalyst for use in thorium oxide slurries to recombine the radiolytic gases has been carried out as part of the Homogeneous Reactor Project at Oak Ridge National Laboratory. More recently, Westinghouse (Pennsylvania Advanced Reactor Project) undertook similar studies. The experimental approach at both laboratories has been similar, and the results are in reasonable agreement. While sufficient data have been obtained to assure that a catalyst can be used in both thorium and thorium-uranium oxide slurries for complete internal radiolytic gas recombination, specific conditions for the most efficient catalyst preparation and use have not as yet been established.

Experimental techniques and methods of analysis were crucial for the study. The out-of-pile tests were conducted in approximately 15-ml stainless-steel autoclaves equipped with a thermocouple well and a capillary pressure connection through the top closure. These autoclaves were filled halfway with a slurry containing the appropriate catalyst, sealed, and pressurized with 550 psi oxygen followed by 900 psi hydrogen from standard high-pressure cylinders. To prevent corrosive damage at high temperatures, an excess of oxygen beyond the stoichiometric 1:2 ratio to hydrogen was used. The autoclaves were then heated in a suitable furnace, stirred mechanically, and the pressure decrease over time was monitored continuously with proper instrumentation. Catalyst preparation and characterization involved impregnating a 100-mesh alumina support with aqueous solutions of cobalt nitrate, nickel nitrate, or their mixtures. The impregnated samples were dried at 120°C for 4 hours and calcined at 550°C for 6 hours in air to eliminate any organic residues and convert the metal nitrates into oxides. The results and discussion section focused on out-of-pile tests conducted with three different catalysts (CoNi, CoCo, and NiCo) at 300°C and a gas hourly space velocity (GHSV) of 10,000 h-1, as illustrated in Figure 7.

From the results presented above, it is clear that the CoNi catalyst shows the highest activity for methane formation at 300°C and a GHSV of 10,000 h-1. The CoCo catalyst also shows good activity but slightly lower than that of the CoNi catalyst. The NiCo catalyst shows relatively low activity compared to the other two catalysts.

For a stoichiometric mixture of hydrogen and oxygen, the rate of pressure decrease was proportional to the total gas pressure in excess of a known value. In the differential form, ∆P/∆t versus P resulted in a straight line, with the slope k being a measure of the experimentally observed first-order reaction rate.

Where V and V' are the gas and slurry volumes, and R and T are the gas constant and absolute temperature. The recombination rates calculated in this way are conservative in that only the hydrogen removed from the gas phase is taken into account, and dissolved and adsorbed gases are ignored. The method of analysis is convenient, however, and permits the evaluation of the relative activity of the various slurry and catalyst. The results of the out-of-pile tests were evaluated on the ability to attain a reaction rate equivalent to the consumption of 2 moles of He per hour per liter of slurry at 280°C and a hydrogen partial pressure of 100 psi.

4-7. 3 Catalytic activity of thorium and thorium-uranium oxide slurries. Experiments with several different samples of ThO2 alone showed that none of the aqueous slurries prepared with the pure oxide possessed the desired degree of catalytic activity for the stoichiometric gas mixture. Reaction rates in the region of 300°C were equivalent to less than 0. 1 mole of He consumed per hour per liter of slurry at a partial pressure of 100 psi. The higher reaction rates appeared to be associated with the slurries prepared with oxides having higher surface areas.

A small catalytic effect for the stoichiometric gas reaction was obtained by incorporating uranium in the aqueous ThO2 slurries; however, the reaction rates remained much too slow to be useful. These tests were carried out with aqueous slurries of simple oxide mixtures, as well as with a mixed oxide prepared by calcining the coprecipitated thorium-uranous oxalates.

4-7. 4 Survey of possible catalysts. The primary criterion, other than satisfactory catalytic activity, for a catalyst to be used in an aqueous thorium oxide slurry blanket is that it have a low thermal-neutron absorption cross section. A convenient estimate of the allowable concentration is provided by the rule that the total cross-section of elements other than thorium, which are in the blanket slurry, should be less than 10% of that of the thorium itself.

On this basis, scouting experiments were carried out with copper sulfate, copper chromite, copper oxide, copper, and nickel powders; silver carbonate (reduces to metal at an elevated temperature); vanadium oxide; ceric oxide; palladium oxide; and molybdenum oxide. Silver and vanadium were rejected because of their higher thermal-neutron cross-section. Palladium appeared susceptible to poisoning, particularly at lower temperatures (<120°C), and subsequent development efforts were concentrated on molybdenum oxide.

The preliminary catalyst evaluation was carried out with slurries of thorium oxide fired at 900°C. Subsequent experience with molybdenum oxide has indicated that it is inactive with low-fired oxides, and its activity, at least at low concentrations, is decreased by the presence of uranium oxide (see the following discussion). Hence, in slurry systems using low-fired thorium oxide or thorium-uranium oxides, silver, palladium, and platinum, which are active in these slurries, may prove to be useful.

4-7. 5 Molybdenum oxide as a catalyst. The molybdenum oxide catalyst used in the initial scouting studies of its catalytic activity was prepared by calcining ammonium paramolybdate at 480°C for 16 hours. It was added to the slurry by dry-mixing 900°C-fired ThO2, UO2, H2O, and the MoO3 and then slurrying the mixture in water. Prior to its use in recombination experiments, the slurry was heated under O2 at 280°C. Recombination data obtained with slurries prepared in this way indicated that reaction rates in the range of 1 to 6 moles of He per hour per liter were obtained for slurries not treated with Ho.

It was found that the catalytic activities of the activated slurries were independent of the method used to prepare MoO3. Also, experiments with MoO3 indicated that it was not stable under the experimental conditions and that this form of the oxide is not the very active catalytic species produced when the slurries were heated with H2.

The addition of sulfate up to 10,000 ppm SO4= (based on thorium) did not appear to impair the catalytic activity of the above slurry containing 0. 05 m MoO3. Corrosion products resulting from the attack on the reaction vessel at the highest sulfate concentration greatly decreased the recombination rate. Similar slurries to which a ferric oxychloride sol (1500 to 1600 ppm Fe/Th) was added showed decreased catalytic activities (approximately one-tenth the iron-free rate), but reducing the iron by treatment with hydrogen gave catalytic activities equal to or greater than those of the iron-free systems.

Subsequent experiments indicated that in slurries of mixed thorium-uranium oxides, the order of addition of the slurry solids, the method of incorporating the uranium, and particularly the oxide firing temperature and time were important. It was necessary in some cases to fire mixed oxides containing 0. 5 mole % uranium as high as 1000°C for as long as 16 hr to give an active slurry with the molybdenum oxide.

In-pile studies. Radiolytic gas production and recombination rates were determined in the ORNL Graphite Reactor using a slurry of ThOs containing approximately 2. 8% uranium, which was approximately 93% enriched in U5. The mixed oxide was prepared by coprecipitation of thorium and uranous oxalates at 10°C followed by calcination at 650°C.

Gas production rates were calculated from the initial pressure rise observed in the autoclave at low temperatures, where the reverse reaction rate could be neglected. 6 x 10^74, concentrations of 250, 500, and 750 g Th/kgH2O. The G-value for water decomposition, assuming an average neutron flux of 4. 2 x 10^4 neutrons/(cm^2 sec), an energy deposition in the slurry of 170 MeV/fission, and a fission cross-section of 580 barns, was 0. 8 molecules per 100 eV.

Gas recombination rates were measured by determining the equilibrium pressures in excess of steam for various temperatures (-25 to 300°C). From an Arrhenius plot, an apparent activation energy of 16. 2 kcal/mole was obtained. There is some evidence which indicates that the action of the stirrer increases the reaction rate either by forming catalytically active corrosion products or by providing reactive steel surfaces.

In all the slurry stability tests in the Low Intensity Test Reactor (see Section 4-6), where enriched uranium was present, sufficient catalyst was added to prevent any net radiolytic gas production. Both PdO and MoO3 were used for this purpose. No radiolytic gas (<25 psi) in excess of steam pressure was observed in these experiments. In the tests where only ThO2 was used, no catalyst was necessary.

In an LITR experiment carried out with a 1000 g Th/kg H2O slurry of 1800°C-fired thorium-uranium oxide (U5/Th = 0. 005), sufficient catalyst (0. 02 m MoO3) was added to give a small partial pressure of radiolytic gas. A G-value (calculated as above) for gas production of 0. 6 molecules of H2 per 100 eV was obtained. From the equilibrium gas pressures at 250 and 280°C, first-order rate constants for gas recombination of constants of 4. 95 and 8. 75 hr−1 were obtained in out-of-pile gas-recombination experiments made with a similar slurry of the same oxide at the indicated temperatures.

The materials problems of aqueous fluid-fuel reactors are among the most challenging in modern technology. The temperatures of interest alone involve considerable departures from those areas for which scientific data and techniques for obtaining such data are available. However, these difficulties are minor compared with those encountered in the actual environment ultimately to be dealt with in an operating nuclear reactor. The radiation which results from the nuclear reactions may profoundly alter the chemistry of the fluids through the formation and decomposition of various chemical species; similarly, the corrosion and physical behavior of materials may be changed by radiation damage and transmutation. Consequently, materials for reactor construction cannot be adequately specified until their behavior in the ultimate reactor environment has been evaluated through in-pile radiation experiments. Such experiments can, however, be safely and meaningfully carried out only after extensive, careful out-of-pile investigation of the systems of interest. Thus, a comprehensive experimental program is required involving facilities ranging from conventional laboratory apparatus to complex in-pile experiments with associated remote-handling and evaluation equipment.

The comprehensive character of the program is further justified by the high cost associated with reactor component failure. This high cost stems from the problems involved in repairing or replacing highly contaminated equipment. These problems are, of course, magnified by a failure that results in a release of radioactivity from the reactor, even though this release is only to a leak-tight reactor containment chamber. Thus, considerable effort to assure unusual reliability of the reactor system is appropriate.

The corrosion behavior of materials in the fluids of interest has also appreciably increased the scope of the program. Corrosion rates showing complex time dependence for as long as the first several hundred hours result from changes in fluid characteristics with time and/or the necessity of forming a protective oxide film. During this period, the rate decreases with time in a quasi-exponential fashion.

Becomes linear when the materials and environment are compatible, the rate is typically a few orders of magnitude lower than rates for the initial period. Flow conditions are also crucial variables and must be considered in all phases of the program; pump loops have admirably fulfilled this requirement. The time dependence of the corrosion rate complicates the interpretation of the data as it is a function of fluid flow, temperature, and fluid composition. Where tests are run long enough to obtain good incremental measurements, the resultant linear rates provide a solid basis for evaluating the effects of different variables on corrosion. However, meaningful corrosion rates cannot be obtained in short-term runs; in such cases, a better comparison can be made based on the unit weight loss over the period. This variable is typically chosen to compare results in runs lasting less than 200 hours.

Aqueous homogeneous reactor media. The simplest apparatus consists of a glass flask in which various materials may be exposed to reactor fuel solutions at temperatures up to the atmospheric boiling point. At elevated temperatures and pressures, a static autoclave designed to withstand the temperature and pressure requirements is used with conventional or specially designed furnaces. A large number of tests may be rapidly and economically made in autoclaves prior to more extensive testing in dynamic corrosion test loops. The static autoclaves are used primarily for solution corrosion tests. Slurry corrosion tests are usually better conducted in equipment which provides agitation or forced circulation in order to prevent the slurry from settling into a dense bed.

Toroids. The toroid apparatus or rotator provides a method of circulating fluids, as required to obtain data on the effect of fluid flow on corrosion rates, without the use of a pump. The toroid itself consists of a length of pipe bent into a circle with its ends joined. Pin-type corrosion specimens as well as a thermocouple well are inserted into the toroid through openings around the circumference. Each pin specimen is held firmly in a fitting, which also seals the opening in the pipe wall. When the environment is compatible, a Teflon (plastic) bushing is used to assist in holding the specimen, as well as to insulate it from the holder. Continuous pressure measurements may also be taken during operation by means of small-diameter tubing connecting the toroid to a pressure gauge or recorder.

To attain the necessary circular motion, the toroid is attached to a horizontal mounting plate, which, in turn, is attached at its center (by means of a bearing) to the vertical shaft of a rotator arm. The rotator arm is, in turn, mounted on the shaft of a variable-speed motor, as shown in Figure 1. The toroid is prevented from rotating about its own axis by means of a connecting rod installed between the toroid plate and an external rigid frame. Dynamic balancing of the unit is required for operation at high speeds (500 to 1000 rpm), and a counterweight is provided for this purpose.

Flow velocities up to 30 fps are obtained in the unit now in use. A heating system, which consists of electric heating wire or elements wrapped around the toroid, provides for operation at elevated temperature and pressure. The entire apparatus is relatively inexpensive and fills the need for a laboratory-scale dynamic corrosion test.

In view of the fractional filling of the toroid which results in "slug flow," corrosion attack rates based on the elapsed time of operation may be corrected to account for the time of immersion in the circulating fluid. This is usually required when corrosion rates obtained in a toroid are being compared with those obtained in the dynamic corrosion test loops described.

The toroid rotator can be used in the study of solutions and slurries. It has been particularly useful for slurries because of the small amount of material required. The exploration of many slurry variables has been possible with amounts of material (50 to 100 g) easily prepared in the toroid rotator.

The flow is divided between a number of parallel channels in which corrosion test specimens can be exposed. Several sets of specimens may be exposed to different flow conditions or a larger variety of specimens to a given set of flow and solution conditions. Loops of various designs have been constructed for other specific purposes.

The test loop consists of a circulating pump, pipe loop, and a pressurizer. The circulating pump is a Westinghouse model 100A canned-motor centrifugal type. This pump delivers 100 gpm at a 250-ft head and is constructed for operation at pressures up to 2500 psi. The loop and pressurizer are heated by means of electric elements cast in aluminum around the outside of the piping.

The loops are usually constructed of 14-inch schedule-80 pipe. Flanged joints are used liberally in the loop construction to provide easy access for inspection and for connection of special experimental equipment. For simplicity, economy, and elimination of crevices, a simple butt joint using lap-joint flanges, bearing rings, and a metal gasket is generally used. The test specimens are exposed in split-channel holders inserted in flanged pipe sections as shown.

The pressurizer, which consists of a vertically mounted section of 4- to 6-inch-diameter pipe, serves several functions. It provides system overpressure, contains space for solution expansion in the loop during heatup, and acts as a surge tank to dampen pressure fluctuations caused by pump startups or shutdowns.

Two types of holders used for exposure of test specimens in the loop are shown in Figure 5-3. The pin specimen holder shown is used to test a variety of materials at a uniform bulk fluid flow velocity. Pin-type specimens inserted in the holes are exposed to the solution flowing through the channel when the holder is assembled. Teflon sleeves on the ends of the pins serve as compressible gaskets to keep the specimens from rattling in the holder during the test and to insulate the specimens from the holder. Figure 5-3 also shows the specimens and holder used in determining the effect of velocity on corrosion. Velocity-effect data thus obtained may be used in the design of reactor piping systems if the data are confirmed by loop experience.

In the dynamic slurry corrosion test loop, shown in Figure 4, the pump discharge flow is directed through the bottom portion of the pressurizer to minimize settling and accumulation of slurry particles, which would occur in this region if the pressurizer were connected as in the solution test loop.

Pressurizer vapor space to supply clean condensate required to continuously purge the pump bearings and prevent slurry accumulation, which would result in excessive bearing wear. The flow of steam or steam-gas mixture through the condenser is by thermal convection. The condensate thus produced flows to the rear of the pump as a result of the static pressure difference between these two points in the system.

A slurry addition device is also incorporated in the loop so that slurry may be charged at elevated temperature and pressure. This device consists of a reservoir tank connected at its bottom to the main loop piping. The slurry may be added batchwise to the tank and, after the top flange is closed, may be forced into the loop by differential pressure, with the slurry being replaced by an equal volume of water from the condensate system.

To ensure purge-water feed to the pump bearings and to provide positive feed of condensate for the slurry addition system in the event of a loss of static pressure differential, a Pulsafeeder pump is incorporated in the condensate circuit and may be used as required.

The behavior of fuels and materials under reactor conditions has been studied in experiments carried out in the Graphite Reactor and Low Intensity Test using small autoclaves or bombs. The autoclaves used for such tests are shown in. The autoclave, enclosed in a specially designed container can and shield plug assembly, is rocked by a mechanism at the face of the reactor shield. The rocking is designed to keep the solution mixed, to maintain equilibrium between liquid and vapor phases, and to keep all surfaces wet. This prevents the formation of local hot spots by high gamma fluxes or localized recombination reaction with resultant explosive reaction of the hydrogen and oxygen formed by radiolytic decomposition of water. The assembly is so designed that the autoclave can be retracted into a cadmium cylinder, thereby substantially reducing the flux exposure. This minimizes the necessity for reactor shutdowns in case of minor experimental difficulties and is useful for obtaining data. In addition, a capillary tube filled with water connects the autoclave to a pressure transducer gauge. By this means a continuous record of the pressure in the autoclave is obtained.

Pump loops. An in-pile loop is similar to all forced-circulation loops; it consists of a pump, pressurizer, circulating lines, heaters, and coolers, and associated control and process equipment. The circulating pump, designed at ORNL, is a canned-rotor type which delivers 5 gpm at a 40-ft head at pressures up to 2000 psig.

The loop assembly and 7-ft-long container are shown in Figure 6. Some of the physical data for a typical loop are summarized in Table 5-1. The loop components are usually constructed of type-347 stainless steel, although one loop has been constructed in which the core section was made of titanium, and another was made entirely of titanium. The loop consists of an inner tube (core), an outer tube (sheath), and end fittings.

III. Flow Rates The flow rate of the liquid through the system is an important parameter that determines the efficiency of the heat transfer process. The flow rate should be sufficient to ensure adequate cooling or heating, but not so high as to cause damage to the system components. The flow rate can be controlled by adjusting the pump speed or by using a flow control valve.

Container, 7 feet long, is 6 inches in diameter at the core end and 8 inches at the pump end and is designed to withstand a pressure surge of 500 psi in case of a sudden failure of a loop component. All electrical and process lines are carried through the pump end of the container, through sealed connectors, and then through the shield plug to the "valve boxes at the face of the reactor. ".

The instrumentation. The equipment in the boxes is used with successive loops, whereas each loop is built for a single experiment and completely dismantled by hot-cell techniques thereafter. Samples of the circulating solution for analysis are withdrawn through a capillary line during operation, and reagent additions can also be made if desired. A capillary connection to the pressurizer is used to follow pressure changes in the loop and to make gas additions when necessary. As in the case of the in-pile autoclaves, previously described, the pressure data can be used to follow a generalized average corrosion rate for all the materials in the loop as the operation proceeds.

Specimens can be exposed in the pressurizer, in holders in the line just beyond the pump outlet, and in the core. The specimens in the core inside the tapered-channel holder and in the annulus around it are exposed to the solution in which fissioning is taking place and to direct pile radiation. The core specimen holder is shown in Figure 5-8. Although not shown, impact and tensile specimens are also sometimes exposed in the core annulus.

The loops must be adequately instrumented to provide accurate measurements of loop temperatures, pressurizer temperatures, and pressures within the loop. The quantity of oxygen and hydrogen in the pressurizer is obtained from the pressurizer temperature and pressure measurements. Electrical power demands of the loop heater furnish a measure of overall fission power and gamma heating within the loop.

Remote-handling equipment. Prior to removal from the reactor, the fuel solution is drained from the loop or autoclave, and all radioactive gas is vented. It is then removed to the hot cell facilities for dismantling and examination.

The operating face of the hot cell for dismantling an in-pile loop is shown in Figure 9. An abundance of 1- and 2-inch-diameter sleeves are included for insertion of remote-handling tools. Two large zinc-bromide windows, eight 6-inch zinc-bromide portholes, and six periscope holes are provided for viewing.

The loop in its container can be lowered from its carrier through a roof plug opening into the cell, where it is clamped in a chuck that rotates the assembly while a disk grinder cuts off the rear section of the container. A jib boom is used to withdraw the loop from the container, and various sections of the loop are then cut out by means of a disk grinder. Figure 5-10 is a photograph of the dismantling equipment in the hot cell.

The severed loop sections are then removed to a remote-examination facility where the more exacting tasks of removing, examining, and photographing loop components, as well as weighing individual test specimens required to determine corrosion damage, are carried out. Hot-cell techniques are again used, with the aid of specially designed remote-handling equipment.

5-3. 1 Introduction. To determine the corrosion resistance of many different materials to uranium-containing solutions, a large number of screening tests have been performed. These tests were carried out either in Pyrex flasks at the boiling point of the solution or in stainless steel autoclaves or loops at 250°C. Oxygen or air was bubbled through the atmospheric boiling solutions, whereas at 250°C, the test solutions were pressurized with 100 to 200 psi oxygen. The corrosion rates of the materials were determined from weight losses of test specimens after the corrosion products had been removed from their surfaces by an electrolytic cleaning process. The results obtained in these screening tests were used to select the most promising materials for further testing under more controlled conditions.

The stainless steel designations are those of the American Iron and Steel Institute. The composition of most of the other materials is listed in Engineering Alloys [23], and those not so listed are included in Table 5-2. All the materials were tested in the annealed condition, except in the cases where parentheses follow the alloy designation in Table 5-3. The number thus enclosed is the hardness of the material on either the Rockwell C (RC) or Rockwell B (RB) scale.

5-3. 2 Corrosion tests in uranyl carbonate solutions. Since uranium trioxide is more soluble in lithium carbonate solutions at high temperatures than in solutions of other carbonates, the corrosion resistance of the materials was tested in a solution of 0. 17 M Li2CO3 and passing carbon dioxide through the solution until the uranium was in solution. The solution was then circulated for 200 hours in a loop pressurized with 700 psi carbon dioxide and 200 psi oxygen. The flow rate of the solution was 20 fps. Table 5-3 shows the materials that were tested and the ranges of corrosion rates that were observed. Comment: 5-3.

Thus, the corrosion resistance of all the metals and alloys tested was good, with the exception of aluminum, copper, and most of the nickel- or cobalt-based alloys. The acceptable alloys developed films that would have prevented further corrosion had the tests been continued longer. Data presented elsewhere show that even the carbon steels and iron would be satisfactory materials in carbonate systems. The fact that the carbonate solution is approximately neutral is undoubtedly the reason for the nonaggressive nature of the solution.

Metal or alloy Range of average corrosion rates: Austenitic stainless steels, Carpenter 20, Carpenter 20 Cb, Incoloy; Ferritic and martensitic stainless steels; Other metals and alloys; Zirconium and Zircaloy—2 <0. 1; Hastelloy C, Nionel, gold, niobium, platinum 0-0.

5-3. 3 Corrosion tests in uranyl fluoride solutions. In contrast to uranyl carbonate solutions, uranyl fluoride solutions are acidic, and in general, the corrosivity of the fluoride solutions is much greater than that of the carbonate solutions. To determine the relative corrosion resistances of many different metals and alloys, a 0. 17 M UO2F2 solution was used. Tests were performed at 100 and 250°C in static systems and at 250°C in loops. The static tests were continued for periods up to 1000 and 2000 hr. The dynamic tests lasted for 200 hr, and the flow rate of the solution past the specimens was 10 to 15 fps.

All stainless steels except type 416 showed low corrosion rates under the conditions of the test. Other experiments showed that most of the corrosion occurred in about the first 100 hours of exposure, during which time a protective coating formed on the steel. After the coating formed, corrosion rates in the range of 0. 1 mpy or less were observed (provided the flow rate was not too high). The static corrosion tests of longer duration verified the dynamic results. Thus, had the dynamic tests reported in Table 5-4 lasted for 1000 hours, the average corrosion rates would have been approximately one-fifth of those shown.

At high temperatures, all stainless steels corrode at high constant rates if the flow rate of the solution exceeds a certain value, which depends on the concentration of the solution and temperature (to be discussed in the next section). In 0. 17 M UO2F2 at 250°C, this critical value is 20 mL/min.

As expected, zirconium and zirconium alloys showed no resistance to attack by uranyl fluoride solutions at high temperatures. In fact, other tests have shown that as little as 50 ppm fluoride ions in uranyl sulfate solutions lead to appreciable attack of zirconium. On the other hand, titanium demonstrated high resistance to uranyl fluoride solutions. The titanium alloys showed higher rates, ranging from 5 to 8 mpy. However, in crevices where oxygen depletion occurs, titanium and its alloys are severely attacked.

It is seen from the foregoing that several metals, including most of the stainless steels, have adequate corrosion resistance to uranyl fluoride solutions if the flow rate of the solution is not too great. Uranyl fluoride cannot be used in a two-region reactor, however, because zirconium and uranyl fluoride solutions are incompatible.

5-3. 4 Corrosion tests in uranyl sulfate solutions. Table 5-5 shows representative corrosion rates of a number of materials obtained in 0. 17 M UO2SO4 at 250°C. Tests that are not included in the table have also been carried out at 100 and 250°C and generally lasted for 1000 to 2000 hr.

In tests of longer duration, the following conclusions can be drawn. All the during which time a protective coating formed (provided the flow rate was less than 20 fps). Once the film formed, corrosion rates less than 0. 1 mpy were observed. The extent of attack during film formation varied somewhat from run to run, and there was no consistent difference from one austenitic stainless steel to the other. Types 316 and 316L showed a tendency toward intergranular attack, and SRF 1132 did not develop a highly protective coating.

Of the ferritic and martensitic stainless steels, types 410, 416, 420, and 440C in all heat-treated conditions were completely unsatisfactory. The corrosion rates of these alloys were nearly constant with time, and the attack was very irregular. Although the precipitation-hardenable steels, 322W, 17-4 PH, and 17-7 PH, showed very low corrosion rates after the formation of the protective film, all displayed a tendency toward stress-corrosion cracking in their fully hardened conditions. Croloy 16-1 demonstrated reasonable corrosion resistance in short-term tests, but long static tests showed the material to be susceptible to intergranular attack in uranyl sulfate solutions.

Titanium, zirconium, and their alloys were extremely resistant to attack by uranyl sulfate solutions at all concentrations, temperatures, and flow rates. In fact, corrosion damage was so small that it was difficult to detect weight changes of the specimens with a standard analytical balance. These alloys will be discussed further in Sections 5-5 and 5-6.

Most of the nickel- and cobalt-based alloys listed in Table 5-5 were rapidly attacked by high-temperature uranyl sulfate solutions. The two exceptions were Hastelloy R-235 and Elgiloy. Hastelloy R-235 resembled an austenitic stainless steel in that it developed a film and corroded practically no further. On the other hand, most of the alloys were resistant to uranyl sulfate solutions; at 100°C, corrosion rates less than a few tenths of an mpy were observed.

In dynamic tests, platinum and gold were resistant to attack under all conditions, but niobium corroded at an appreciable rate, about 7 mpy at 15 fps. The corrosion rate of niobium depended on the flow rate of the solution, and at higher flow rates, somewhat higher corrosion rates were observed. Static tests showed that tantalum and chromium are corroded only slightly under most conditions. If the solution contained dissolved hydrogen, tantalum was seriously embrittled by highly oxygenated uranyl sulfate solutions at temperatures above 250°C, oxidized chromium to the soluble hexavalent state, and under these conditions, the rate of attack was several mils per year.

A number of nonmetallic substances were statically tested in 0. 17 m UO2SO4 at 100°C. Those tested included various grades of sintered alumina and graphite, sapphire, silicon carbide, sintered titania and zirconia, and quartz. In fact, the corrosion resistance of the sintered alumina was higher, the higher the purity. In static tests at 250°C in 0. Sapphire corroded at the rate of 3. 6 mpy. The high corrosion rates of quartz and Pyrex glass show why glass-lined equipment cannot be used for high-temperature experimental work. In addition to the attack on the glass, the resultant silicates cause precipitation of uranium.

5-3. 5 Conclusions. Type-347 stainless steel has been the basic material of construction in most homogeneous reactor programs. It has serious limitations, particularly from the corrosion standpoint; but in consideration of the additional important factors of cost, availability, and experience with its use, it appears a suitable material. The excellent corrosion resistance of titanium and several of its alloys makes them very useful in special applications, particularly where the limitations of the stainless alloys make their use impractical.

Introduction: The decision to use type-347 stainless steel as the major material of construction and a uranyl sulfate solution as the fuel for HRE-1 and HRE-2 was based, at least in part, on the demonstrated compatibility of the two components and on the fact that the technology of the austenitic stainless steels was well developed. Articles 5-4. 2 through 5-4. In Article 5-4. 8, the effect of ionizing radiation on the corrosion of stainless steel is discussed. Further details are reported in the HRP quarterly progress reports.

All the results reported in this section were obtained with solutions containing between 50 and 1000 ppm oxygen to prevent reduction and precipitation of uranium, which leads to the formation of sulfuric acid that attacks stainless steel at a very high rate. The possibility of localized attack in crevices where oxygen depletion can occur has been investigated, but except for stress-corrosion cracking in the presence of chloride ions (discussed in Section 5-9), no serious problems have arisen. Even with unstabilized stainless steels that have been sensitized by appropriate heat treatment, no severe intergranular attack in uranyl-sulfate solutions occurs. The coupling of such noble metals as gold and platinum to type-347 stainless steel does not result in accelerated attack of the stainless steel.

Effect of temperature. When type-347 stainless steel is placed in a uranyl-sulfate solution at temperatures up to 100°C, the steel retains its metallic luster, and only after long periods of time does it develop a very thin tarnish film. At higher and higher temperatures, the film becomes progressively heavier, and in the temperature range 175 to 200°C, a quite heavy black scale forms on the surface of the steel in about 100 hr. Up to about 175°C, the film that forms is nonprotective, and the corrosion rate is dependent on the composition of the solution and independent of the flow rate past the steel surface. Some typical corrosion rates in this temperature range are presented in Table 5-6.

The heavy film that forms in the temperature range 175 to 225°C offers some protection to the underlying steel, but in most cases, the protection is poor. At higher temperatures, a heavy scale forms fairly rapidly on the stainless steel, and once it has been established, it affords essentially complete protection against further corrosion, provided the flow rate of the solution is not too great.

The protectiveness of the film appears to be related to its composition. At temperatures up to 175°C, as determined by X-ray diffraction, the scale is composed of mixed hydrated ferric and chromic oxides. At higher temperatures, the amount of hydrated oxide decreases, and the amount of anhydrous alpha ferric oxide containing chromic oxide in solid solution increases.

The amount of metal that dissolves during the period of film formation depends primarily on the flow rate, the composition of the solution, the temperature, and the presence of additives.

5-4. 3 Effect of solution flow rate. From room temperature to about 175°C, the solution flow rate has essentially no effect on the corrosion rate of the stainless steel.

Typical results obtained using a tapered-channel specimen holder in a stainless steel loop. The data were obtained from a series of runs in which flow rates and corrosion rates are varied to determine their effect on weight loss rather than corrosion rate is used as the ordinate.

At flow rates up to about 20 to 25 fps, all weight losses were nearly the same regardless of exposure time. Between 25 and 35 fps, weight losses increased sharply, and at still higher flow rates, the weight loss of the specimens was proportional to the exposure time. An examination of the specimens revealed that up to about 20 fps, the specimens were completely covered with a black, relatively heavy, tenacious scale which, after it formed, practically prevented further corrosion. In the region of 25 to 35 fps, there were areas of the specimens that remained free of scale. At flow rates greater than 40 fps, the specimens did not develop any visible scale, and upon removal from the holder, the specimens had the appearance of severely etched steel.

Although the results presented in -11 are for only one concentration of uranyl sulfate, a similar velocity effect is observed at all uranyl sulfate concentrations and at all temperatures above 200°C. The temperature of 200°C is in the middle of the transition region below which velocity is unimportant and above which a velocity effect is observed.

The velocity below which a completely protective scale forms is defined as the critical velocity. The weight loss of stainless steel specimens above this velocity increases linearly with time, and the corrosion rate is constant.

5-4. 4 Effect of uranyl sulfate and sulfuric acid concentration. All uranyl-sulfate solutions are acidic, and the more concentrated the solution, the lower the pH as measured at room temperature. The acidity is further increased by adding sulfuric acid to dilute uranyl sulfate solutions to prevent hydrolytic precipitation of copper and uranium at high temperature.

Generally, the higher the concentration of uranyl sulfate or free acid in solution, the greater the extent of metal dissolution during film formation; below the critical velocity, the lower the critical velocity, and the higher the film-free corrosion rate above the critical velocity. Table 5-7 shows how the above three regions change with uranyl-sulfate concentrations.

Containing 0. 005 m CuSO4, on the amount of metal dissolved during film formation and on the critical velocity of the system. The effect of adding sulfuric acid is qualitatively the same at all uranyl sulfate concentrations and at all temperatures above 200°C and produces a result similar to that of increasing the uranyl sulfate concentration. It has been found that low concentrations of copper sulfate in uranyl sulfate solutions have no significant effect on the corrosion of type-347 stainless steel.

5-4. 5 Temperature dependence of flow effects. It has been stated that increasing the flow rate of the solution generally produces a detrimental effect on the corrosion of type-347 stainless steel. This effect is temperature-dependent, as shown in Figure 13. Although the results are based on a 0. 17 m UO280.

Uranyl sulfate and sulfuric acid concentrations; increasing the temperature decreases the amount of metal that dissolves during film formation, increases the critical velocity, and increases the film-free corrosion rate of the stainless steel.

5-4. 6 Effect of corrosion inhibitors. In spite of the second limitation, a number of inorganic salts have been added to uranyl sulfate solutions to determine their effectiveness in reducing the corrosion of type-347 stainless steel. Those substances that have been found to be effective include sodium nitrite, sodium hydroxide, and ammonia.

The addition of chromium(VI) to high-temperature uranyl sulfate solutions reduces the amount of metal corroded during film formation; greatly increases the critical velocity, but materially increases the corrosion rate of the stainless steel at flow rates in excess of the critical velocity. Results obtained using coupon-type corrosion specimens in a loop through which 0. 17 m UO2SOz was circulated at 250°C indicated that 200 ppm chromium(VI) increased the critical velocity from 20 to 25 fps to between 50 and 60 fps. Other tests were carried out in which two pin-type specimens were exposed for 100 hr at flow rates both above and below the critical velocity. The corrosion rates at 70 fps are true rates which would not change on continued exposure; those at 12 fps are average rates for the 100-hr exposures and would decrease. Had the exposure been for 200 hr, the rates would have been approximately half those shown. It should be noted that as the film-free corrosion rate increased, the average corrosion rate at the low flow rate decreased.

Uranyl sulfate solutions. The salts that have been studied the most are beryllium sulfate, lithium sulfate, and magnesium sulfate. The phase stability of the above solutions has been reported, as have the corrosion results. For example, the weight loss for a 200-hr exposure of only 5 mg/cm for velocities up to 60 fps. This may be compared with 100 mg/cm for exposure to a 1. 3 m UO2SOx solution under similar conditions. The effect of lithium sulfate was less pronounced at 250°C and high velocities. At 250°C and 50 fps, weight losses were approximately 70 and 400 mg/cm, respectively, for solutions of these same concentrations. For flow velocities less than 30 to 40 fps, initial weight losses were found to be in the range of 5 to 15 mg/cm for equimolal concentrations of uranyl sulfate and lithium sulfate up to 4. 4 m and temperatures up to 350°C.

In dilute uranyl sulfate solutions, the addition of sulfate salts also reduces the corrosion of stainless steel. However, at temperatures of 250°C and higher, the solutions are chemically unstable. Complex hydrolytic precipitates demonstrate the greatest stability, particularly those containing beryllium sulfate. Among the three sulfates investigated, the solutions with lithium sulfate were the least stable. Sulfuric acid can be included in such solutions to prevent precipitation, but this may lead to a loss of some effectiveness of the sulfate salt.

5-4. 7 Qualitative mechanism of the corrosion of stainless steel in uranyl-sulfate solutions. It appears that the corrosion process involves the dissolution of iron from the stainless steel surface by uranyl ions and the subsequent precipitation of a solid phase containing iron, uranium, and sulfur. The dissolved iron reacts with hydrogen sulfide to form ferrous sulfide, which then reacts further with uranyl ions to form insoluble uranium sulfides. These reactions result in the formation of a solid phase that is deposited on the stainless steel surface and eventually leads to pitting corrosion.

The austenitic stainless steels and most other metals and alloys of practical importance in large-scale homogeneous reactors are thermodynamically unstable in aqueous solutions and depend on protective films for their corrosion resistance. Fortunately, when austenitic stainless steels are oxidized in high-temperature uranyl sulfate solutions, the steel oxidizes uniformly so that no element (or elements) is leached preferentially from the alloy. However, not all the alloying elements contribute to film formation equally, and some may actually interfere with film growth.

Both iron(II) and nickel(II) are soluble in uranyl sulfate solutions to an appreciable extent at high temperature, but if an oxidizing agent more powerful than uranyl ions is present, the reaction indicated by Eq. (5-2) takes place. [Manganese(II) also remains in solution. ].

In a system containing oxygen, the total reduction process is represented by Eq. (5-3), although it is highly probable that other ions enter into the reaction mechanism. Only in the absence of oxygen is either UO2+ or hydrogen found in the system.

If we examine the equations as written, it is apparent that the overall corrosion of stainless steel in uranyl sulfate solutions containing oxygen can be represented by the sum of Eqs. (5-1), (5-2), (5-3), (5-6), and (5-7), taking into account the percentage of each element in the alloy. Measurements of nickel content and oxygen consumption have been found to agree well with weight loss for determining total corrosion. Since the nickel remains soluble and replaces hydrogen ions, the pH of the solution slowly increases as corrosion proceeds.

In a system depleted in oxygen, uranium is reduced and precipitated as U3O8, producing hydrogen ions while ferrous ions remain soluble. Consequently, a pH measurement gives an indirect measure of the presence or absence of oxygen in the system. Similarly, the presence of ferrous ions, even in very small amounts, indicates a deficiency of oxygen and that uranium is beginning to precipitate from the solution.

Once an anhydrous protective coating has formed on the surface of the stainless steel, the steel corrodes at an extremely slow rate. However, since the oxide coatings are thick, it is probable that they are under stress, and fine cracks or imperfections form. When the film-free metal at the base of the crack is exposed to the solution, the metal again corrodes actively until the corrosion products repair the crack.

In the proposed mechanism of film formation, both iron and chromium form ions before undergoing hydrolysis and crystallization on the surface of the stainless steel. This mechanism can account for the existence of a critical velocity since ions and hydrolyzed particles can diffuse into the circulating stream before forming the film if the diffusion layer is too thin. Since the diffusion-layer thickness depends on the flow rate or turbulence, the process of film formation is, in essence, in competition with diffusion and turbulence. Under conditions where the rates of dissolution and hydrolysis are fast, the critical velocity would be expected to be relatively high.

It has been mentioned that solutions of uranyl sulfate are acidic and that the higher the uranyl sulfate concentration, the lower the pH of the solution. These two factors essentially work against each other with regard to film formation - a high corrosion rate would introduce relatively large concentrations of corrosion products into the solution in the immediate region of the stainless steel surface, a factor which should facilitate the formation of a protective film. But even though more corrosion products are present, the hydrogen ion concentration is also substantially greater.

The corrosion process can be accounted for by considering the effect of temperature on the rate at which the corrosion products are formed and on their rates of hydrolysis. Because the initial corrosion rate and the rate of precipitation are fast, it would be expected that the crystallite size of the oxide would be smaller the higher the temperature of formation, and this has been found to be true. Apparently, a compact layer of small crystals forms a more protective and adherent coating than one composed of large crystals.

It is probable, though seemingly paradoxical, that chromium(VI) serves as a corrosion inhibitor, at least under certain conditions, because it accelerates the film-free corrosion rate of stainless steel. In this respect, the effect of adding chromium(VI) to uranyl sulfate solutions is similar to that of increasing the temperature. Because of the increased corrosion rate, large quantities of corrosion products are formed near the surface of the stainless steel, and hence the solubility limit of the oxides is exceeded rapidly, and many small crystals form on the surface of the stainless steel. Even though the rate of hydrolysis is not increased as it is at the higher temperatures, the diffusion rate is slower, so that the corrosion products are in the vicinity of the stainless steel longer. Because the film forms faster, the critical velocity is higher in the presence of chromium(VI) than in its absence, other variables remaining the same.

The reason why the addition of relatively large quantities of inert sulfate salts to uranyl sulfate solutions reduces the corrosiveness of the resulting solutions is not known, but may be due to one of a number of factors, such as the formation of stable complexes, reduction of acidity, changes in oxidizing power, increased viscosity and density, or changes in colloidal properties of the oxide.

5-4. 8 Radiation effects. The effect of radiation on the corrosion behavior of stainless steel is important in relation to the use of this material in construction of the fuel-circulating system and reactor pressure vessel of a homogeneous reactor. The radiation levels thus encountered, however, are considerably less than for the zirconium core tank. For example, the fission power density of the solution in contact with the stainless steel in the HRE-2 will not exceed 1 kW/liter for operation at 10 MW, and in a large-scale two-region breeder or single-region burner reactor would not be more than 5 kW/liter.

Number of in-pile loop and in-pile autoclave experiments have been carried out. A few scouting type experiments on the effect of Van de Graaff electrons on steel corrosion have also been conducted. Although most of the information for the radiation effect on steel has its source in these experiments (in particular, the loop experiments), information of a general nature has been derived from the performance of the stainless steel portion of the HRE-1.

With loop experiments, specimens were located in the core portion of the loop and in portions of the loop external to the core and out of the high-flux region, as shown in Figure 6 (Article 5-2. 2). Coupons and other specimens exposed in these latter positions are designated as "in-line specimens. " Specimen preparation, in general, comprised only cleaning after machining. However, prior to radiation exposure, each experimental system, including the specimens, was exposed first to water, with or without oxygen, and then to oxygenated uranyl sulfate solution at a temperature near the test temperature. Corrosion attack of a specimen was determined from weight-loss measurements, visual inspection, and metallographic examination. The course of corrosion of the system during exposure in both loops and autoclaves was followed by measuring the rate of oxygen. All the loops contained steel specimens except those otherwise indicated. Experiment L-2-14 contained only a few steel coupons. A detailed description of methods and procedures employed with the in-pile tests is presented in Article 5-5. 3.

The behavior of steel under exposure to a solution in which fissioning is occurring in the immediate neighborhood of the surface appears to change appreciably with changes in experimental conditions. No comprehensive picture of the behavior is available as yet, and only the general features of the experimental results can be reported. Pits of 1 to 2 mils in depth, which appear to spread laterally and merge (with increasing attack), are usually found on the surfaces of specimens which have suffered appreciable attack. After the merging of pits, the attack appears to proceed fairly uniformly over a surface.

Average corrosion rates, which have been determined for core specimens in a 0. 17 m UO2SO4 solution plus varying amounts of H2SO4 and CuSO4, varied between 0. 1 and >180 mpy for solution power densities up to 5 kW/liter and for solution velocities up to 45 fps. These rate values for specimens and the other rates quoted below are based on exposed specimen areas and radiation time.

And an average solution velocity of about 40 fps exhibited a rate of 40 mpy. The pattern of the results in this case indicated that the high solution velocity was, in part, responsible for the high rate. In the other experiment, DD, rates varying from 2. 5 to 57 mpy at solution power densities from 0. 3 to 1. 7 kW/liter and solution velocities from 10 to 40 fps were observed. This experiment was the first of the series of loop experiments. The higher rates in this loop may have been associated with the exceptional solution conditions. Only a small amount of excess acid was added initially, and it was estimated that this excess was consumed in the solution of nickel produced in corrosion during the course of the experiment. This solution condition was not repeated in subsequent experiments.

No significant acceleration of corrosion has been observed with specimens exposed at in-line positions in the loops; that is, at positions in which the sample is not exposed to neutrons but is exposed to a solution that has passed through the core. Average corrosion rates for in-line specimens were less than 2. 3 mpy for all cases considered. However, in one experiment, L-4-12, a single pit was observed on the surface of the recessed shoulder of the volute inlet of the pump, a high-velocity region. It should be noted that the rates mentioned are based on the loss in weight of a specimen during exposure as measured after a cathodic defilming treatment. The oxide is not always removed quantitatively in this treatment. Weight gains were frequently observed for in-line specimens, and in these cases, the rate of attack was assumed to be zero.

The results of the experiments with Van de Graaff electrons have not shown any significant effect of electron irradiation on the corrosion of type-347 stainless steel by uranyl sulfate solutions at high temperatures. 17 M UO2SO4 solution at 250°C. The intensity of electron irradiation was such that the estimated power density from absorption of electron energy in solution adjacent to the specimen was 20 to 30 kW/liter. Two exposures, each of 50-hour duration, were made, and no significant difference was observed between the attack of irradiated and nonirradiated specimens.

Proportional to the total fission power averaged over the total solution volume of the high-pressure system might have an adverse effect on the behavior of the stainless steel located in the regions external to the core. In loop experiments at average power densities up to 1. 5 kW/liter, no such effect was apparent.

Fission power density.

The metal and alloy are very corrosion-resistant in the absence of radiation. However, under exposure to nuclear radiations, particularly those from fissioning uranium solution, corrosion rates may be appreciably greater than those observed out of radiation.

5-5. 2 Corrosion of Zircaloy-2 and zirconium in uranyl sulfate solutions in the absence of radiation. Most of the radiation-free experiments were of the type in which specimens of the metal to be tested were exposed in autoclaves or loops constructed of stainless steel or titanium. CuSO4 was also added in some tests. Cleaned, as-machined specimens were employed. These films could not be removed without damage to the metal, and the amount of corrosion was estimated from the weight of a specimen together with the oxide.

Zirconium and Zircaloy-2 specimens exposed in solutions circulating in stainless steel systems collected some of the stainless steel corrosion products (iron and chromium oxides) in an outer layer of scale. This outer layer could be removed partially by a cathodic defilming operation. A sodium hydride bath treatment was required for complete removal.

A few experiments with Zircaloy-2 were carried out in autoclaves similar to the in-pile type described in Article 5-2. 2. In these experiments, the autoclave was constructed of Zircaloy-2 and was charged with the test solution, oxygen gas, and specimens. The test surfaces were machined and cleaned. Corrosion during exposure was determined by measuring the rate of oxygen loss within the system.

Data reported by Thomas on the behavior of Zircaloy-2 in deaerated water at temperatures of 290 and 315°C, when converted into values for the thickness of the layer of oxidized metal, are similar to those for H-54 and H-55. The water data at 315°C are illustrated in Figure 15 by the dotted line.

5-5. 3 Methods and procedures employed within in-pile tests. In-pile investigations were carried out with autoclaves and loops (described in Article 5-2. 2). A majority of the autoclave experiments and all the loop experiments were conducted in the Low Intensity Test Reactor at ORNL. The maximum thermal-neutron flux available for these experiments was about 2 X 10^13 neutrons/(cm^2 sec).

For most experiments, the autoclave and the corrosion specimens were constructed of the metal to be studied. The autoclave was partly filled with the solution to be tested, pressurized with oxygen, and stirred by rocking. Measurements of the oxygen pressure in the system during exposure provided information regarding the course of corrosion.

Most of the in-pile loops were constructed of type-347 stainless steel; however, in one experiment, the loop was of titanium, and in another, the core portion only was of titanium. Corrosion specimens were placed in the core and in a portion of the loop which is outside the region of appreciable neutron flux. The specimens in the latter position were usually duplicates of the core specimens. The overall corrosion behavior during exposure was followed by measuring the rate of oxygen consumption within the system and by chemical analysis of solution samples which were withdrawn from time to time. Specimen examination included visual and metallographic inspection and weight measurements. Unless otherwise noted, all tests were run with a light-water solution of 0. 17 m UO2SO in a type-347 stainless steel loop.

The method of filling and sealing many of the early autoclave experiments included air at atmospheric pressure within the system. Solution analyses after irradiation indicated that most of the nitrogen from this air was fixed in solution in some oxidized form with possible concentrations (if all NO3-) up to or about 0. 05 M.

The usual preparation of specimen surfaces consisted of cleaning after machining. Before exposure to radiation, the systems with specimens were first subjected to high-temperature water, with or without oxygen, and then to the uranyl sulfate solution at temperatures near the test temperature. The loop systems were exposed to solutions of normal uranyl sulfate before the exposure to the U85-enriched uranyl sulfate solutions.

The thermal neutron flux to which a Zircaloy-2 specimen was exposed while in-pile was determined by measuring and comparing the amount of the induced activities, Zr90-Nb, in the specimen and in a control sample of Zircaloy-2. The latter was irradiated together with a cobalt monitor in a separate experiment in which the specimen and cobalt did not contact the solution. For some experiments which contained steel specimens, similar measurements were made utilizing the Cr51 activity. The fission power density in the uranium solution adjacent to a specimen was calculated from the resulting value for the thermal flux together with the value for the fission cross-section of uranium, assuming 200 MeV per fission.

Recently, comparisons have been made between values for the flux indicated by cobalt monitors within the test system and by Zircaloy-2 within the same system. The flux values determined from the cobalt were about 25% less than those from Zircaloy-2.

Results of in-pile tests with Zircaloy-2 and zirconium: The results of autoclave experiments have demonstrated that the corrosion rate of Zircaloy-2 under irradiation at a given set of exposure conditions does not change with the time of exposure, in contrast to out-of-pile behavior. Two in-pile autoclave experiments, H-57 and H-858, plotted in Figure 15, illustrate this. The lines through the plotted points for tests under radiation exhibit a slope of 1, and those for out-of-pile experiments a slope of about 0. 4. In both cases, the values for penetration are those calculated from the results of oxygen consumption measurements.

The assumptions made were that the uniform and that oxygen was lost only in the formation of ZrOz. These assumptions appear to be generally valid for the in-pile cases. The corrosion penetration calculated from weight changes of specimens was usually in near agreement with the penetration calculated from oxygen data. A pitting type attack was detected in only one of the numerous specimens which have been exposed. The cause of pitting in this case is not yet clear, but it may be due to localized conditions such as stress or temperature gradients.

The time scale that is employed for the radiation experiments is cumulative time with the reactor at power. During exposure of a given experiment, the reactor was frequently at zero power for appreciable periods. It has been observed in autoclave experiments that a penetration of 0. 005 to 0. 01 mil takes place after shutdown and that following this, corrosion essentially stops until power operation is resumed. The corrosion that takes place during shutdown appears to delay the onset of attack when irradiation is reinstituted; the amount of delay about balances off the additional attack that occurs during shutdown.

The oxide, which is found on Zircaloy-2 surfaces under irradiation, is markedly different from that formed outside of radiation. The in-pile specimens, which are removed from the autoclaves, are covered with a relatively heavy brass-colored scale. This scale cracks and flakes off to some extent upon drying. When a specimen is immersed in acetone and then air-dried at 100°C, the scale flakes off almost quantitatively. Remaining scale can be removed by cathodic defilming. The specimen surfaces after defilming generally exhibit a dark-gray color and, in some cases, interference colors. In-pile loop specimens, on the other hand, appear to be free of heavy scale of the type found in autoclaves. There is usually a dark-brown-colored scale on the surfaces, the amount of which is greatest for specimens exposed at the lowest power densities. The scale, of unknown composition, can be removed in a cathodic defilming operation.

Chemical analyses of heavy scale on autoclave specimens revealed that they contain several percent by weight of uranium and copper in addition to zirconium. Sulfate is found in some scales. Core specimens from loop experiment L-2-17 have been analyzed for uranium as removed from the loop. Twenty micrograms of uranium per square centimeter were found on the surface of a specimen exposed in a location at which the solution velocity was about 1 fps.

Specimen holder. In some cases, where specimens had different ratios of total to exposed areas, results indicated that the rate of attack of the covered areas was nearly the same as that of the exposed areas. However, the use of only the exposed area gives more conservative values. 6, and in autoclaves, the ratio was nearly 1.

Loop results obtained with 0. 17 M UO2S8Ou solutions but with other conditions varying are illustrated in Figure 58. Except for relatively minor variations, the solutions for the experiments represented by curves A, B, and C were the same. Experiment L-2-14, curve EZ, was exposed to solution velocities in the range 10 to 40 fps; annulus specimens to velocities of about 1 fps. Where annulus-type specimens were employed, they usually exhibited rates somewhat greater than the channel specimens.

Results obtained with loop experiments with 0. 04 m UO2SO4 solutions (L-2-10 and L-2-17) are illustrated by the curves in -17. A portion of line B from -16 is included in -17 for comparison. Corrosion rates for channel specimens in this solution are greater at the same power density than those for specimens in 0. 17 m UO2SO4 solutions. The shape of the curve through the channel data is also different. As will be discussed later, these channel data may be interpreted in terms of a beneficial effect of solution velocity on corrosion. The approximate locations of specimens in the channel with respect to the power density to which the specimen was exposed and the average velocity of solution at the specimen are indicated in -17. The annulus specimens, which were exposed at low solution velocities, corroded at higher rates than the channel specimens.

Other solution variables. The presence of Li2SO4 as an additive in the uranyl-sulfate solution has resulted in a decreased radiation effect in some autoclave experiments. No appreciable effect on the rate has been noted for other solution additives such as CrO3 and KTcO4. An experiment to which MoO3 was added indicated an adverse effect for this material in solutions.

Other zirconium alloys have been tested in some experiments, but only one of these alloys, Zr-15% Nb, has exhibited appreciably better resistance than Zircaloy-2. This niobium alloy has been tested in several loop and autoclave experiments. In the beta-quenched condition, it corroded at rates lower than those observed for Zircaloy-2 by factors of three.

Zircaloy-2 autoclave experiments in the LITR and MTR reactors with solutions which contained UO2SO4 depleted of U3O8 have exhibited an acceleration of corrosion over that expected out-of-radiation. In these tests, absorption of fast neutron and gamma rays gave rise to a power density in solution of about 6 kW/liter in MTR experiments and 0. 6 kW/liter in the LITR experiments. In each reactor, about one-half of the power was from gamma-ray and one-half from fast-neutron absorption. At 280 to 300°C, the observed rates were about 1 and 4 mpy at the lower and higher powers, respectively.

Tests of the effect of fast-electron irradiation on Zircaloy-2 corrosion: The effect of fast electrons from a Van de Graaff accelerator on the corrosion of Zircaloy-2 by uranyl sulfate solutions has been tested in experiments at 250 and 300°C. In both cases, the specimens were mounted in a small thermal siphon loop constructed of titanium. Employing electrons with an initial energy of 1. 5 MeV and currents in the neighborhood of 2 x 10^4/(em)(sec), the experimental arrangement was such that an electron traversed approximately one-half of its range before impinging on the specimen. The estimated power density due to absorption of beta-ray energy in the solution adjacent to the specimen was 60 to 90 kW/liter in each experiment. The duration of exposure was 40 hr at 250°C and 60 hr at 300°C. No significant acceleration of the corrosion due to irradiation was found in either case.

Discussion of the results of radiation corrosion experiments. The results of the radiation experiments presented above suggest that the radiation effect on the corrosion of Zircaloy-2 by uranyl-sulfate solution is not directly associated with changes in the solution under irradiation. If the radiation chemistry of these solutions at high temperature is not greatly different from that of acid solutions near room temperature, the yield of H-atoms and OH radicals in the solution from beta and gamma radiation is at least as great as that from heavy particles.

Oz, corrosion effects due to changes in solution would be as pronounced for beta-gamma radiation as for heavy particles. However, no effect of beta radiation was observed. It was also mentioned that no effect has been observed of varying Hz and Oz pressures in in-pile autoclave experiments. Thus, the primary action of the radiation is in the metal or its protective oxide film, or both, probably through the formation of interstitials and vacancies by heavy nuclear particles. Beta-gamma radiations can also produce interstitials in such materials, but with considerably less efficiency. The number of such defects produced by an electron in the energy range employed in the van de Graaff experiments may be expected to be a factor of 100 or more less than the number produced by a 1-MeV neutron. Hence, the rate of defect formation by the electrons was small compared with the rate of formation by fast neutrons in the depleted UO2SO, in-pile tests.

On the basis of these considerations and of the various experimental observations, a qualitative model of the radiation corrosion of Zircaloy-2 has been developed, from which an equation relating fission power density in solution and corrosion rate has been derived. The equation has the form: where k is the corrosion rate constant, P is the fission power density in solution, T is the temperature, c is the concentration of dissolved hydrogen, z is the activity coefficient for hydrogen, and n is a constant that depends on the surface conditions.

Under exposure to heavy-particle radiation, the protective oxide film forms on the metal as it does out of radiation, and the kinetics of the protective oxide formation are about the same in and out of radiation. Under irradiation, however, the film does not continue to increase in thickness. Radiation produces defects of unspecified nature in the protective oxide, and in the presence of these defects, the oxide breaks up and/or reacts with the solution to form a non-protective scale. The rate at which the protective oxide breaks up is proportional to the concentration of defects in the oxide at the oxide-solution interface. Under these conditions, a steady state is established in which oxide is removed at a rate equal to the rate of formation, and in which a steady-state thickness of film results. The corrosion rate is determined by the rate of transfer of reagents across this film.

In considering the effect of solution composition and flow velocity on the radiation corrosion of Zircaloy-2, a number of interesting phenomena, related apparently to the sorption of uranium on or near the protective film, were observed. Some of these effects are illustrated in Table 5-9. As shown in Table 5-9, at a given solution power density, the degree of difference was less in high-velocity regions (30 to 40 fps) than in low-velocity regions (10 fps). The low-velocity (1-fps) annulus specimens in the 0. 04 m solutions were attacked at markedly higher rates than the channel specimens. The addition of 0. 04 m excess H2SO2 to the 0. The addition of a greater amount also produced a beneficial effect.

It appears likely that most of these solution and velocity effects are associated with the sorption of uranium on the surface of the test specimens. As mentioned previously, uranium is usually found in the scale from specimens exposed in autoclave experiments. The amount of this uranium is less for specimens exposed to solutions with 0. One to two percent uranium by weight is usually found for specimens exposed under the former conditions, and 5 to 6% under the latter condition. It has been found that the autoclave results in different solutions can be intercorrelated as well as correlated with the loop results if a corrected power density, P, rather than the power density in the solution is employed. In this correlation, which is empirical, the corrected power density is assumed to be given by the expression P = (Pin - Pout) / (1 + Kf/Ki), where Pin and Pout are the power densities at the inlet and outlet of the test section, respectively, Kf is the flow rate factor, and Ki is the internal circulation factor.

The curve expressed by Eq. (5-9) was assumed for the relationship between power density in solution and corrosion rate in the absence of scale at 280°C. The constant K in Eq. (5-17) was evaluated from the best fit of the 280°C autoclave data to the curve. The same value of the constant was found to apply in fitting the 250°C-autoclave data to Eq. (5-10).

Which represents the line drawn through the results of the 250°C-loop experiments. On the basis of these correlations—that is, when the corrected power density is employed—it appears that there is no appreciable difference between the corrosion rate in autoclave solutions containing 0. 04 m H2SOx and in those free of excess acid.

The fact that the autoclave data can be correlated with the loop data represented by Eqs. (5-9) and (5-10) is of questionable significance, since it is not known whether the rates in the 0. 17 m UO2SO4 loop experiments were influenced by sorbed surface uranium. As mentioned previously, the loop specimens are usually free of heavy scale of the type found in autoclaves. However, uranium was found on specimens from the L-2-17 experiment, which was with a solution 0. 04 m UO2SO4, and it appears likely that uranium sorption on a given Zircaloy-2 specimen was responsible for an appreciable fraction of the total corrosion attack on the given specimen both in this experiment and in experiment L-2-10. 04 m UO2SO4 experiments.

Introduction: The corrosion behavior of commercially pure titanium and of titanium alloys has been tested at elevated temperatures in uranyl-sulfate solutions under dynamic and static conditions in the absence and in the presence of radiation. The equipment and testing procedures employed were identical to those used in tests of Zircaloy-2 and type-347 stainless steel described previously.

5-6. 2 Corrosion of titanium and titanium alloys in uranyl sulfate solutions in the absence of radiation. The commercially pure titanium and the titanium alloys developed a tightly adhering film under exposure, which exhibited interference colors ranging from tan to deep blue or black, depending upon the alloy and upon conditions and length of exposure. This film could not be removed without damaging the metal. Titanium specimens exposed in uranyl sulfate solutions circulating in stainless steel loops collected some of the stainless steel corrosion products (iron and chromium oxides) in an outer layer of scale, which could be removed electrochemically.

The average corrosion rates of commercially pure titanium alloys in radiation environments were less than 0. 1 mpy. Under similar conditions, high-strength titanium alloys (containing 5% Al, 24% Sn, 3% Al, 5% Cr, 6% Al, 4% V, and 4% Mn) exhibited corrosion rates up to 0. 4 mpy. One alloy (Ti+8%Mn) showed only 0. 05 mpy at 300°C. These rate values were calculated from the decrease in weight of specimens as measured in long-term tests following an initial exposure period of several days. The specimen in each case was descaled electrochemically prior to the final weighing, but some film remained on the specimen. Other tests have shown that the resistance of titanium to radiation damage can be improved by alloying with small amounts of elements such as Al, Si, V, Nb, or Mo.

Corrosion of titanium and titanium alloys in uranyl sulfate solution under irradiation. Specimens exposed in the core of in-pile loops were coated with an adherent bronze-colored film, which could not be removed without damage to the metal. In some loop experiments, the bronze film was overlaid with a dark-brown scale similar to that found on Zircaloy-2 specimens and was thickest for those specimens exposed at the lowest fission power densities, as for Zircaloy-2. This scale was partly removed from the titanium and alloys by a cathodic defilming operation prior to final weighing. The value for the corrosion rate of a core specimen was calculated from the loss in weight during exposure as indicated by final weighing, the exposed area, and the radiation time.

The results obtained with core specimens from in-pile loop experiments shown in indicate the spread of experimental data over the range of conditions investigated (Table 5-9). Some of the available experimental values at low power density and low corrosion rates have been omitted from. Most of the data shown were obtained with Ti-55A.

In-pile corrosion rate is greater than that expected out-of-pile, and the in-pile rate increases slightly with increasing fission power density. There is no significant effect of exposure temperature within the range investigated. A few results suggest that high solution velocities had an adverse effect on the in-pile corrosion, but other results show no such adverse effect. It is possible that fretting between specimens and holder was responsible for the additional weight loss of those specimens, which indicated the adverse velocity effect. It should be noted that the amount of scale retained by a specimen after descaling can and may affect the apparent corrosion rate of the specimen, and differences in the amount of scale retained by different specimens may influence the apparent corrosion behavior with respect to the variables power density, velocity, and temperature. The few results available for titanium alloys indicate that, with the exception of the Ti-6% Al-4% V in experiment L-2-14, these materials corroded at rates which are about the same or only slightly greater than those for Ti-55A under the same conditions. The rates for the Ti-6% Al-4% V in L-2-14 were about double those for Ti-55A.

The corrosion rate of Ti-55A in in-line positions outside the radiation field was found to be in the range of 0 to 2. 5 mpy. 03 mpy or less. The rates determined from specimen weights were generally less than those observed with specimens exposed in the core, although in some experiments the maximum rate observed for in-line specimens was about the same as that observed for core specimens. Differences between the amount of scale retained by in-line and core specimens after descaling may account, in part, for the apparently lower rates of in-line specimens.

The results of in-pile autoclave experiments indicated corrosion rates under irradiation, which are in general agreement with those determined in in-pile loop experiments.

The Van de Graaff experiment employed a solution containing 0. 04 M UO2SO4. Exposure to fast electrons was for a period of 50 hours and at an intensity such that the estimated power density due to electron absorption was about 60 kW/liter in the solution adjacent to the specimen.

The studies reported in this section indicate that corrosion-erosion problems of high-temperature (250 to 300°C) aqueous oxide slurry systems may be satisfactorily controlled. However, under unfavorable conditions, very aggressive attack has been noted.

Aqueous slurry corrosion problems in nuclear reactors were studied in the early days of the Manhattan Project, as reported by Hiskey and Kirshenbaum in Great Britain's Harwell laboratory and in the Netherlands' KEMA laboratory.

Most of the work described above has been done at the Oak Ridge National Laboratory and is summarized in the reports cited earlier. Most of the circulating corrosion tests have been carried out at temperatures of approximately 250 to 300°C in stainless steel equipment.

Slurry attack may be regarded as simultaneous abrasion and high-temperature water corrosion. Information on the high-temperature corrosion of materials by water in nuclear reactors is discussed in the Corrosion and Wear Handbook, by L. Scheib, and for other systems in the Corrosion Handbook. This serves as a basis for the consideration of similar aspects of attack by aqueous slurries.

For practical utilization of circulating aqueous slurries, a suitable balance must be made between corrosion-erosion attack on materials of construction and handling properties of the slurry, including viscosity, heat transfer, settling, resuspension, and caking characteristics.

Properties of the thoria, or other materials used to prepare the slurry, all exert important influences on the corrosion-erosion problem. All these factors are important in certain circumstances, and their effect has frequently been found to depend strongly on the presence or level of other factors. Considerations of such interactions should not be neglected; however, the strongest factors in attack by aqueous slurries appear to be particle size, abrasiveness, and degradation susceptibility, flow velocity and pattern, and metal composition. Important secondary factors include temperature, atmosphere, slurry concentration, and additives. The effect of radiation, particularly fissioning, is expected to interact strongly with such other variables as flow and type of gaseous atmosphere.

Materials of interest. Although materials found to be unsatisfactory in the purely aqueous system are usually not suitable for slurry systems, the order of excellence and the relative importance of different variables has been found to be altered in slurry systems. Most of the materials and alloys investigated were the same as tested in aqueous uranyl sulfate solutions described previously. Results for classes of materials are summarized as follows: 1. Metals. In general, metallic materials have been found to be unsatisfactory in slurry systems due to rapid corrosion and wear. Exceptions include certain refractory alloys such as tungsten carbide and molybdenum disilicide which exhibit excellent resistance to corrosion and wear, but are expensive and difficult to fabricate. 2. Ceramics. Aluminum oxide, zirconium oxide, silicon carbide, and titanium dioxide have all been used successfully. The most important factor affecting their performance is the nature of the bond between the ceramic and the metal substrate. 3. Polymers.

Polyvinylidene fluoride (PVDF) has been found to be an excellent electrical insulator but is relatively expensive. Other polymers such as polytetrafluoroethylene (PTFE), nylon, and polypropylene have also been used successfully in some applications. Composites. Composite materials consisting of ceramic or metal particles embedded in a polymer matrix have been found to be very effective in slurry systems. The composite can be tailored to meet specific requirements by selecting the appropriate particle size and distribution, as well as the type and amount of binder used. Coatings. Many types of coatings have been investigated for use in slurry systems, including thermal spray coatings, electroless nickel plating, and ceramic coatings. The most effective coatings are those that provide a barrier to the corrosive environment while still allowing heat transfer through the coating.

The austenitic stainless steels are the most useful class of construction material for slurry systems. Of the various types available, type 347 has been tested most extensively. Differences between various types do not appear to be significant.

It appears possible to reach corrosion rates considerably below 1 mpy with flows of 20 fps. The most severe attack of stainless steel has been localized attack noted on pump impellers and housings, orifice restrictors, and test specimens in high-velocity regions.

Ferritic and martensitic stainless steels are attractive for certain operating parts because of their hardness properties.

Carbon steels or low-alloy steels are of interest because of their low cost. Results based on corrosion specimens in systems at high oxygen concentrations, or with hydrogen added, indicate comparatively high attack rates decreasing with time, and it is possible that acceptable rates will be achieved. However, pitting problems and potential embrittlement by hydrogen or alkali have not been explored. The effect of chromate from corrosion of stainless steel by slurries with high oxygen concentrations in a combined carbon steel-stainless steel system has not yet been determined.

Nickel alloys appear to perform somewhat better in hydrogenated systems but generally are not so corrosion-resistant as the austenitic stainless steels in oxygenated slurries.

Noble metals have been tested alongside other types to assist in evaluating the effects of pure erosion. To a rough approximation, the ratio of attack rates on platinum and gold is constant over a wide range of conditions, as suggested by Hiskey.

Tantalum, in one test at 21 fps, gave results comparable to platinum. Bronze and aluminum were severely attacked by high-temperature aqueous slurries. 5% CaO disintegrated under similar conditions.

Types and mechanisms of attack. The attack by aqueous slurries on metals under nuclear reactor conditions can be treated as a succession of stages: (a) collision of slurry particles with the surface, (b) damage to the surface, and (c) reaction of the underlying metal with the aqueous phase. Particles may be caused to strike the surface by impingement, by eddy action, or by shear forces.

Impingement attack, which is noticed on upstream surfaces of objects in the line of flow, in piping elbows, etc. , is visualized as resulting from a breakthrough of flow lines by slurry particles as the direction of flow is changed on meeting an object. The attack primarily results from the impact of the larger slurry particles with the surface. An example is shown in Figure 19.

Impingement target efficiency (90-93) is estimated as a function of the dimensionless separation number VoD2(ps - p)/18uDz, where Vo is relative slurry velocity, Dy is the dimension of the obstructing body, D is the particle diameter, mw is fluid viscosity, ps is solid density, and p is slurry density. A sigmoid curve of target efficiency versus the logarithm of the separation number was obtained for various shapes with 55 to 80% target efficiency at a separation number of 1, and with a limiting value of separation number, 0. 06 for cylinders, below which impingement does not occur.

Corrosion rate would be proportional to concentration, velocity, target efficiency, and erosivity (the mass of metal removed per unit mass of particles striking the metal surface). Erosivity would be expected to be a function of the flow characteristics, particle energy and abrasiveness, and other properties of the particle and the metal, although a general formula for it has not been developed.

Eddy attack is noted on pump impellers and housings, high-velocity test specimens, pipe walls, and other similar regions. It is characterized by relatively deep-gouged pits in the direction of flow, quite smooth on the bottom, or by a deep general polishing. The pits are frequently undercut to the downstream side so that they feel smooth in the direction of flow and rasplike in the reverse direction. Attack due to wakes, cavitation, or flow separation is more localized. It is frequently possible to associate the localization of the attack with some change in the flow pattern. An illustration of such attack on a pump impeller is shown in Figure 2-13.

It would appear that in some sense the impingement model above might still apply to eddy erosion, with larger particles being thrown to the outer circumference of an eddy. The edge velocity of the eddy would be at least equal to the fluid velocity at the point of eddy origin. The postulation of a lower limit on eddy size has been noted. Small eddies might become trapped in surface imperfections, leading to continuing localized attack. Wake effects are similar to the cavitation erosion studied in water tunnels by Shalnev, in which the initiation of cavitation in the wake of circular objects is attributed to eddies. Eddy attack will be very sensitive to equipment shape and streamlining effects.

Low shear attack is a relatively gentle, low-velocity attack, such as might be observed on pipe walls, coupon specimen surfaces parallel to the direction of flow, etc. It is presumed to result from a reduction in thickness of the protecting boundary layer as flow velocity increases. As indicated by Johnstone and Thring, this type of attack would be sensitive to scale-up effects, becoming less severe at equivalent Reynolds number as the flow-channel dimensions are increased. It is also likely to be sensitive to water corrosion effects.

Water corrosion is normally observed in aqueous slurry systems. In many cases, especially when a substantial quantity of electrolyte is present, a bright polished surface has been observed. With slurries having particle sizes near their degradation minimum, there appeared to be no decrease in corrosion rate with time, which implies that the outer portions of the protective oxide film were being removed by the flowing slurry as fast as it was formed.

Factors involved in surface damage to oxide film or metal proper by impinging particles are complicated. Impact energy, its localization by particle sharpness, and its transfer due to particle hardness and strength, are also important. Rosenberg and others noted that sharp sand was about four times as erosive to steel (in an air blast) as larger, more rounded sand. For many slurries in toroid or pump loop tests, the most severe attack of metal surfaces is noted concurrently with the most rapid degradation in the size of the slurry particles.

For all metals of interest, except the most noble, the destruction of a protective oxide film exposes reactive metal to the aqueous medium. The rate of reaction is very high, and the rate of film re-formation will control this reaction rate and the net amount of metal consumed. Changes in the chemical environment and pH via gaseous atmosphere, additives, or ingrowing corrosion or fission products will strongly affect the rate of metal reaction and oxide re-formation.

In toroid testing, information can be obtained on the corrosion rates of various metals, as well as the degradation of slurry particles and qualitative slurry handling characteristics by examining metal pin specimens and analyzing the withdrawn slurry.

In pump loops, a larger amount of quantitative information is obtained at several different velocities and flow patterns from an examination of loop components as well as specimens. Generalized incremental loop corrosion rates and slurry properties are obtained at suitable intervals from the analysis of withdrawn samples.

Quartz slurries were tested in small-scale loops and spinning cylinder systems in the early days of the Manhattan Project. It was observed [106-107] that erosion was proportional to the square or cube of the velocity, varied strongly with particle size, decreased with time as particle size degradation took place, and exhibited a constant ratio for different materials under the same conditions. Uranium dioxide has a Mohs scale hardness of 6. 1 [108] and to a certain extent would be expected to resemble thoria under a hydrogen atmosphere, as described later.

Uranium trioxide. The attack of stainless steel pump-loop components by uranium trioxide slurries at 250°C was essentially nil in tests extended for thousands of hours, even on pump impellers with a tip velocity of 120 fps. The lack of attack by circulating uranium trioxide slurries under conditions in which impingement certainly occurred is attributed to the relative softness of the uranium trioxide particles.

Thorium oxide. The major portion of studies on corrosion-erosion characteristics of high-temperature aqueous slurries has been carried out using thorium oxide. Most preparations have used the calcination product of thorium oxalate precipitated under various conditions, with calcination temperatures from 450 to 1600°C having been used. Thoria prepared by other procedures, such as formate precipitation, has also been examined.

Classified using sedimentation procedures to remove unduly large particles, thoria calcined at 650 to 900°C because of its properties was considerably degraded by continued pumping and was reported to show greatly reduced corrosion rates as this occurred.

The hardness of thoria minerals has been reported as 6. 5 on the Mohs scale. Laboratory preparations of thoria have been observed with hardness greater than 7. The hardness of many mineral oxides, of a composition similar to the protective film on metals, lies between 6 and 6. 5. However, sapphire attacked by high-temperature aqueous thoria slurry has a hardness of 9.

Two main effects related to particle size have been distinguished: the effects of largeness of particles and of particle degradation. Large particles cause erosion-corrosion, aligning with the impingement model of slurry attack. Tables 5-12 and 5-13 display comparisons of pump-loop corrosion tests. In these tables, the larger-particle-size slurry exhibits a more aggressive attack.

The removal of large sintered particles resulted in a substantial reduction in corrosion rate for all materials in the tests shown in Table 5-12. This effect for thoria produced by high-temperature calcination was sufficient to justify including similar classification in the regular production procedure. Particles of large crystallite size (>0.

Low-crystallite-size materials (calcined at relatively low temperatures, e. g. , 800°C) become degraded as circulation proceeds, and aggressiveness is diminished. Thus, a shorter test showed a higher rate of corrosion, and a test using previously pumped material showed a lower rate of attack. This, and the change of particle size with time, is illustrated in Table 5-13.

Effect of calcination temperature. Sintered particles, of course, would cause increased attack. However, unless sintering occurred, particles have not appeared to increase in size on calcination. Table 5-14 illustrates these points. It is also noted that the material calcined at higher temperatures is less degraded. In longer tests, this would be expected to result in maintaining the original corrosion rate, rather than resulting in a decrease in rate when the particle size becomes smaller.

Effect of concentration: In general, corrosion-erosion by slurries has been observed to increase with concentration [115-116] and is roughly indicated to be directly proportional to concentration in concentration ranges of reactor interest. As concentration is increased, the effect of rheological properties on flow characteristics becomes more pronounced, and the effect on corrosion would become altered.

Tests which used no added oxygen, oxygen concentrations of 250 ppm (160 ce/kg H2O) appear sufficient to protect stainless steel. Toroid tests in which the oxygen was consumed resulted in more aggressive attack of this metal. Corrosion products were black rather than tan-brown in color and were found to contain Fe3O4.

The corrosion resistance of carbon steel can be improved by exposing it to a hydrogen atmosphere. In some cases, rates of corrosion have been found to approach those observed for stainless steels in the same experiment.

Titanium appears to be equally corrosion-resistant in oxygenated and hydrogenated systems, provided the slurry is not strongly alkaline. At 150°C, titanium is more readily abraded by slurry with a hydrogen atmosphere.

Nickel alloys and Stellites appear, according to Douglas, to be significantly more corrosion-resistant under a hydrogen atmosphere, and several nickel alloys have been found to be more resistant than stainless steel when exposed to it in experiments under a hydrogen atmosphere.

The nature of the atmosphere also affects the oxidation state and solubility of certain corrosion products, which, in turn, may affect the properties of the slurry. Under an oxygen atmosphere, iron exists as Fe2O3, and chromium as soluble, acidic CrO3.

Effect of additives. Additives include unavoidable corrosion products and fission products, necessary or difficultly avoidable recombination catalysts, uranium inclusions in the particle, and certain impurities and optional materials added to modify the properties of the slurry.

Corrosion products have not been observed to affect the course of corrosion in oxygenated systems, although they have built up to levels of a few grams per liter in certain lengthy tests. Soluble chromic acid may affect the corrosion rate of such materials as carbon steel. No experimental results are available on the effect of fission products.

Molybdenum oxide, a potential recombination catalyst, has shown a mild corrosion-inhibiting action. Uranium inclusions in the thoria have not been found to increase corrosion rates. Chloride, which can cause stress-corrosion cracking of stainless steel, is undesirable in any quantity, as is fluoride.

Sodium, calcium, and hydrogen; phosphates (sodium monobasic, dibasic, tribasic, pyro-); silicates (sodium meta- and more acid compositions); and fluorides (thorium). In general, it has been found that additives imparting acidity (e. g. , H2SO4, Th(SO4)2) tend to attack ferrous-based materials, especially under low oxygen or reducing atmospheres. There is less effect of moderate concentrations with oxygen atmospheres. Complexing or reacting additives (e. g. , alkaline phosphate with titanium, fluorides with zirconium) tend to destroy protective films and thereby increase attack rates.

All soluble ionic additives appear initially to be adsorbed on the thoria surface. Their effect on corrosion is much greater after surface capacity is exceeded. Surface capacity varies with different thoria preparations, primarily with surface area.

5-7. 4 Effect of operation conditions. Flow velocity is a very important factor in corrosion by slurries. Corrosion rate appears to be approximately proportional to the square of velocity at moderate velocities and possibly to a somewhat higher power at higher velocities. The effect of velocity is shown in Table 5-14 and in Table 5-15. 6-7. 3 Effect of slurry composition. The corrosion rate of carbon steel by various slurries has been investigated by several workers. The results are given in Table 5-12. It is seen that the corrosion rate increases with increasing concentration of chlorides and sulfates, but decreases with increasing concentration of phosphates and silicates.

Velocity effects are also shown on the pump impeller in -20. Velocity increased radially from the hub, and attack was most severe at the rim. However, the vanes and inner shroud surface were polished, which indicates the importance of boundary-layer considerations in the study of such effects.

Cavitation may also be an important factor in the high-velocity attack. The attack on pump impellers has been found to be more severe in experiments in which gas bubbles were believed to have been entrained in the slurry. Erosion patterns similar to those observed by Shalnev have been found on pin-specimen-holder channel walls, with the most severe points of attack a few pin diameters downstream from a pin. Although this agrees with Shalnev's observations, it is not clear whether the effect is due to cavitation or simply high eddy density at this point.

Shape effects: The significance of shape effects in corrosion by flowing slurries can be substantial, with the most severe attack being observed due to eddy erosion-corrosion linked to shape effects. In some instances, the attack has seemed self-accelerating as pits form.

Design considerations are quite important. Streamlining of all sensitive parts and regions should be practiced to the maximum extent possible in order to avoid impingement or wake effects. Surface irregularities such as rough finish, crevices, or protrusions should be avoided. Conditions conducive to cavitation should be avoided since vigorous attack would be anticipated under such conditions.

Time changes in attack rate with time generally are not observed after the slurry has reached its equilibrium condition. Until this condition is reached, the slurry particle size may be larger than its degradation minimum. Consequently, more aggressive attack is usually observed in the early exposure period.

Indicated that both experiments had an initial rate of approximately 1 mpy with thoria slurries in D2O at 280°C (oxygenated). However, no reduction in rate with time was noted under radiation, while the rate decreased significantly with time in a longer unirradiated control. Similar results were obtained on pure D2O under radiation. Inclusion of enriched uranium in a thoria preparation permitted an experiment in which a fission power density of 0. 5 to 1 watt/ml was achieved. Only a slight increase in rate, several tenths of a mill per year, was noted as a result under these conditions.

Of the possible types of titanium and its alloys commercially available in the United States, only unalloyed titanium and one alpha alloy A-110AT (5. 0% Al, 2. 5% Sn) are satisfactory for homogeneous reactor applications. Beta alloys are not yet available, and alpha-beta alloys, often structurally unstable under high stress and high temperature, cannot be welded without subsequent heat treatment.

It is difficult to fabricate. For such applications, so-called "unalloyed titanium (A-40 and A-55)" is used. These high-purity grades are readily weldable. In contrast to the stronger grades, they are stable and available in all forms. Their disadvantage is their low strength at elevated temperatures, which, except as linings, makes their use for large high-pressure, high-temperature equipment doubtful. Extensive use of titanium for a homogeneous reactor will probably depend upon the eventual development of a fabricable high-strength alpha alloy.

The pressure vessel for HRE-2 is constructed of A-212 grade B steel clad with 347 stainless steel. The serious possibility of radiation damage is the most important metallurgical limitation of this material. This problem is discussed in Article 5-8. 8.

5-8. 2 Fabrication and morphology of Zircaloy-2. When work was started on the HRE-2 core tank, very little was known about the physical metallurgy and fabrication of zirconium alloys. A procedure was available for the fabrication of zirconium fuel elements, but the variables of fabrication had not been investigated in detail. Since this core tank was a vital portion of the reactor system and was needed early in order to proceed with the pressure-vessel fabrication, it was built to a time schedule that permitted only a limited amount of development work. During the development work for the tank, many variations were found in the available Zircaloy-2 plate. These included variations in mechanical properties, in bend radii, and in the amount of laminations and stringers.

This procedure resulted in a fine-grained, equiaxed but oriented structure, as shown by the anodized sample in -21. Two disadvantages of this material were stringers found in the structure and preferred orientation, as shown by uneven extinction in rotation in polarized light.

Since it was suspected that the stringers were responsible for some of the variation in mechanical properties, they were examined in considerable detail in the morphological study. The two types of stringers prevalent in Zircaloy-2 are an intermetallic stringer, usually found in the alpha grain boundary regions, and a coarse equiaxed stringer, which is more commonly observed in the interior of the material.

The following is edited for spelling and grammar mistakes: boundaries, as shown in -21, and an elongated void within the grains, caused by trapped gases. The latter type was found rarely in HRE-2 coretank metal, but a small one may be noted in the photomicrograph of the developed material. This type may be largely eliminated by vacuum melting of the original ingots. It has been determined that the intermetallic stringers were formed during fabrication. While the upper fabrication temperature of 850°C was thought to have been in the all-alpha region, this is now known to be in error. The correct temperature for the alpha to alpha-plus-beta transition is 810°C, and that for the beta to beta-plus-alpha transition is 970°C. These temperatures will vary slightly with ingot composition. Holding at a temperature just above the lower boundary of the two-phase region resulted in the presence of small amounts of beta in the grain corners. By quenching samples held at 840°C, it was shown that approximately 15% of the material had been beta phase at that temperature and that the beta phase had been present in the grain corners. Iron, nickel, and chromium are beta stabilizers and will partition to the beta phase, which will be strung out during rolling.

Indicating anisotropic properties, this was confirmed by a polarized-light examination. The actual orientation of the material was determined using a special X-ray diffraction technique, with the data being reported in the form of inverse pole figures shown in Figure 22. Since variations were found in the intensity of the pole concentrations, it is evident that the core-tank plate had a preferred orientation in all three directions. Quantitative calculations indicated that the plate had adequate ductility.

To improve the quality of Zircaloy-2 and to predict what structures would be encountered in weldments, a study of the effect of heat treatment and fabrication practice was initiated. Representative photomicrographs of structures resulting from these studies are presented in Figure 23. The fine "basket-weave alpha structure observed in beta-quenched samples appeared to offer the most likely starting point. Recrystallization of this structure by annealing at temperatures between 700 and 800°C resulted in the formation of very large alpha grains, without stringers or intermetallic precipitates. Cold-working of the "basket-weave structure, 15% or less before annealing, also resulted in the production of large grains; however, if the amount of cold-working exceeded 20%, improvement in the form of fine grains (ASTM 6 to 8) with a more nearly random structure was obtained.

Scrap from the core-tank plate was heat-treated by beta quenching, cold-worked 20%, and alpha annealed. The diffraction results after this treatment are also shown in Figure 22. The intensity of the peaks has been decreased by a factor of two, and the peaks shifted 20 degrees from the original position. These changes indicate an increase in ductility in the normal direction.

The results of the morphological study were used to outline an improved fabrication schedule for Zircaloy-2. This schedule has been used successfully by commercial fabricators while more complete fabrication studies are being made. The material obtained from this procedure has a microstructure such as that shown in Figure 21. It is essentially free of stringers, contains little or no intermetallic precipitate, and has small equiaxed grains with essentially a random orientation as seen under polarized light.

5-8. 3 Mechanical properties of zirconium and titanium. The use of titanium and zirconium for pressure-containing equipment is complicated by the fact that both metals are hexagonal, rather than cubic, making preferred orientation a severe problem. In addition, the determination of the mechanical properties of hexagonal metals, using standard tests developed for cubic metals, is questionable because the suitability of these tests for hexagonal materials has not been established. 6-8. The corrosion resistance of zirconium can be improved by alloying with small amounts of niobium or hafnium, while titanium can be strengthened by alloying with aluminum, vanadium, or molybdenum. 7-8. In addition, both metals are subject to hot cracking when welded. 8-8.

The welding of zirconium and titanium is difficult because of the high thermal conductivity of these metals, which results in excessive heat input during welding and a tendency for the heat-affected zone to be coarsened. The most successful methods of joining zirconium and titanium involve the use of diffusion bonding or brazing techniques, rather than traditional welding processes. Zirconium is used extensively in the nuclear industry because of its high melting point, good corrosion resistance, and low neutron absorption cross-section. Other applications of zirconium include chemical process equipment, heat exchangers, and marine hardware, while titanium is used in sporting goods, medical implants, and jewelry.

Zirconium. The anisotropy of Zircaloy-2 is not defined by the usual tensile test data given in Table 5-16. Tensile data from both longitudinal and transverse subsize specimens cut from plates fabricated by various procedures are given in this table. With the exception of the commercial plate, the difference in tensile strengths both at room temperature and 300°C are within the experimental limits.

Fracture and the ratio between them. In isotropic material, the percentage reduction would be the same in both directions, and the ratio would therefore be one. As shown, some reduction in anisotropy was obtained by the use of the developed procedure described previously.

Anisotropy of these materials may also be shown by V-notch Charpy impact tests. Since size effects are known to be critical in this type of test, standard size specimens were used, thereby eliminating the thin core tank plate. Charpy V impact energy curves obtained with specimens and notches cut from various orientations from commercial plate and from a plate fabricated by the developed procedure are shown.

With Zircaloy-2, the appearance of impact samples was not obviously indicative of properties as with steels. Shear lips, which are normally a mark of ductile fracture, were found on some specimens from certain orientations regardless of temperature, but on others from the same plate, shear lips were not found at any temperature.

The effects of notches and cracks in zirconium were studied using the drop-weight test as developed for steels by Pellini and others at the Naval Research Laboratories. This test determines the highest temperature at which a crack will propagate through a specimen undergoing limited deformation. For steels, this temperature is distinct and reproducible and has been labeled the NDT (nil ductility transition) temperature. Commercial Zircaloy-2 showed surprisingly good properties from this test. The NDT temperature was -160°C for the longitudinal direction and between -100 and -150°C for the transverse direction. However, contrary to the definition, when the fracture faces were examined, shear lips were found even at very low temperatures.

As part of the brittle fracture study, a plate of A-70 titanium containing 400 ppm of hydrogen was tested. The results from this plate gave impact curves that were not affected by orientation and had a sharp break similar to steels. The NDT temperature for this brittle plate was 100°C and was located at the lower break of the impact curve.

Irradiated metals. In spite of the many questions that have been raised about the adequacy of mechanical property tests for hexagonal metals, the difficulties of which are magnified in testing irradiated samples, some mechanical property tests of irradiated samples have been attempted. Subsize tensile and impact specimens of Zircaloy-2, crystal-bar zirconium, and A-40 titanium have been irradiated in fissioning uranyl-sulfate solution, in in-pile corrosion loops, at temperatures of 250 to 280°C, to total fast fluxes (>1 MeV) of up to 3 X 10^ nvt for zirconium and 10^ for titanium. Zirconium appears to be resistant to radiation damage under these conditions. The only changes noted have been small changes in the yield point. Titanium seems to undergo some embrittlement. The tensile and yield strengths for titanium increased while the reduction in area decreased. The changes were by about 10% of the unirradiated values.

5-8. 4 Welding of titanium and zirconium. Successful welding is, therefore, dependent upon protecting the molten metal and adjacent area from all contaminants. Prior to the construction of the HRE-2 core tank, the only method used for welding zirconium was fusion welding, with the necessary protection achieved by conducting the operations inside inert-atmosphere boxes.

In a joint effort, the Newport News Shipbuilding & Dry Dock Company and Oak Ridge National Laboratory developed a machine for multipass welding of Zircaloy-2 in which face protection was achieved by the use of trailers attached to the torch. Root protection was achieved either by special backup devices or, where possible, by purging closed systems. In this device, a standard Heliarc torch was mounted on a small metal box, or trailer. Both the method of supporting the trailer and its shape were varied with the configuration of the part being welded. Inert gas was distributed through the box by internal copper tubes along both sides. For all these welds, the torch and trailer were held fixed by a device that positioned the torch and spring-loaded it against the work. The workpieces were moved under the torch, which remained fixed in a vertical position. The welding, with all the necessary adjustments and controls, required two operators.

The joint configuration of a typical Zircaloy-2 weld is shown in Figure 26. All root passes were made using the pre-placed insert, which had been machined from swaged Zircaloy-2 wire. The inserts were tacked into place with a hand torch before the machine welding was started. The first filler metal pass was made with either 3/32- or 1/8-inch wire, and all others with 1/8-inch. Careful wire brushing with a stainless steel brush was required after every pass. Welding details for a typical joint are tabulated in Table 5-17; detailed procedures are given in Ref. 27.

In both this work and that which subsequently developed out of it, one of the major problems has been to determine the quality of the weld. Welds were examined visually, with liquid penetrants, and usually with radiography; however, none of these provided information about the degree of contamination. Measurement of the average microhardness of a prepared sample has proved to be an acceptable and sensitive indication of contamination. While this is a destructive test, it has been adopted as a standard test for this work. In the actual production welding, reliance had to be placed upon the strict adherence to procedures previously shown to be satisfactory by the destructive tests. Average hardnesses of over 500 DPH (diamond pyramid hardness) are found in lightly contaminated welds and increase to approximately a thousand diamond pyramid hardness numbers in contaminated metal. The absence of contamination was confirmed by vacuum fusion analyses of weld sections.

Construction of a titanium circulating system for a homogeneous reactor requires many welds of all sizes, some of which must be made in place. While the procedure discussed above for zirconium can also be used for titanium, it is impractical for field welding of equipment and piping of varying sizes and shapes.

It has been found possible to make acceptable weldments in unalloyed titanium using only conventional tungsten inert gas arc welding equipment. By welding an A-55 base plate (average hardness of about 160 DPH for the annealed plate) with a filler rod of A-40, it is possible to consistently obtain welds with average hardnesses of less than 190 DPH (10 kg) for plates 1/4-in. and less in thickness. Hardnesses of less than 220 DPH are achieved for heavier plates requiring more passes.

Austenitic stainless steels show an obvious trend towards lower heat inputs and the use of small molten pools. The reduced size and temperature of the pool minimize the possibilities of contamination during welding and also permit more rapid cooling after the weld is completed. These changes reduce the welding speed and thereby make this a precision welding method rather than a high-speed production procedure. Details of the procedure, including a comparison with welds made in atmosphere boxes, a discussion of adequate inert gas coverage, and the use of surface discoloration as an inspection method, are given in Ref. 136. In an effort to simplify and make more versatile the procedures used for welding Zircaloy-2, an attempt was made to adopt the inert gas procedures successfully developed for titanium. Under similar conditions, it was, however, found to be more difficult to prevent contamination in Zircaloy-2 than it had been with titanium. Where multipass welds in titanium had resulted in hardness increases of 20 to 30 DPH numbers, similar welds in Zircaloy-2 increased by 50 to 100 numbers. It was also necessary to increase the radius used on the bend tests of the weldments from twice the plate thickness with titanium to four times the thickness with Zircaloy, primarily because of the lower ductility of the base metal.

After several equipment failures in which evidences of melted titanium were found under operating temperatures not exceeding 250°C, a study of the ignition and combustion ignition temperature of titanium. The ignition temperature of titanium has been determined by several investigators using different methods. The burning rate of titanium has been studied in a number of experiments, but the results are not entirely consistent.

Two types of tests were developed for studying the ignition reactions: in one, a thin metal disk was fractured either by gas pressure or by a plunger, while in the other, either a thin sheet or a 1/4-in. rod was broken in a tensile manner. In either test, both the composition and pressure of the atmosphere could be varied. With both types of tests, it proved to be surprisingly easy to initiate combustion of titanium. Ignition and complete consumption of both disks and rods occurred when titanium was ruptured, even at room temperature, in high pressure of pure oxygen.

The limiting conditions for the ignition of A-55 titanium varied with the total pressure, the percentage of oxygen, and the gas velocity. Under dynamic conditions in pure oxygen, ignition occurred at total pressures as low as 50 psi, but with 50% oxygen, the total pressure required was 700 psi, with the reaction curve becoming asymptotic with the pressure axis at about 35% oxygen, showing no ignition would occur at any total pressure with this or lower oxygen concentrations.

As might be expected, lower critical oxygen pressures were required for the propagation of the combustion than for the ignition. If the molten spot was formed by an external means, propagation and consumption of the entire sample occurred with about 20% oxygen.

Because of the autoignition of titanium, various metals and alloys such as stainless steel, aluminum, magnesium, iron, tantalum, columbium, molybdenum, Zircaloy-2, and alloys of titanium were tested with oxygen pressures up to 2000 psi. Only the titanium alloys and Zircaloy-2 reacted. Within the limits of accuracy of these studies (+50 psi), no differences were found in the behavior of the various titanium alloys.

While zirconium is similar to titanium in that autoignition can occur, the critical oxygen pressures appear to be considerably higher. Under dynamic conditions, titanium ignited with 50 psi oxygen, a zirconium titanium ignited at a pressure of 350 psi, but a similar strip of zirconium required 750 psi. A 1/4-in. titanium rod ignited under the same conditions as the strip, but a zirconium rod did not ignite at 1500 psi oxygen.

Development of new zirconium alloys: An alloy development program was initiated at ORNL to discover a radiation-corrosion-resistant zirconium-based alloy with satisfactory metallurgical properties, such as weldability, strength, ductility, formability, and stability.

A wide variety of binary zirconium alloys were exposed in autoclaves and in-pile loops to uranyl-sulfate solutions (see Section 5-5), but only alloys of zirconium with niobium, palladium, or platinum showed greater corrosion resistance than Zircaloy-2. With the exception of phase diagrams and a few mechanical property tests on low-niobium alloys [138], no information on any of these systems was available in the open literature. The few results for the mechanical property tests indicated very brittle alloys.

Two phase diagrams for the zirconium-niobium system are in the literature. A cursory check of the diagram by determining the eutectoid temperature and approximate composition confirmed the first of these. A few preliminary transformation specimens, with near-eutectoid compositions, revealed complicated and embrittling transformation structures.

Products, morphologies, in-pile corrosion resistance, fabrication techniques, metallographic procedures, and some mechanical properties. At least three transformation reactions occur in the zirconium-niobium binary system. The transformation sequence is quite complex, with the only straightforward transformation being a eutectoidal transformation occurring close to the eutectoid temperature. The most troublesome transformation is the formation of an omega phase which occurs in beta-quenched and reheated samples. Time-temperature-hardness studies for material heat treated in this manner showed very high hardnesses in short times with low-temperature aging treatments. Aging times of three weeks did not result in over-aging and softening of such material. This transformation would make multipass welding of this material very difficult.

Because of the hardness and slow transformations of binary zirconium-niobium alloys, ternary additions up to 0. 5% Cu have been studied. In general, the primary effects of the addition of small amounts of the ternary substitutional alloying elements are the lowering of the maximum temperature at which the hardening reaction can occur, an increase in incubation time for the beginning of the hardening reactions, a lowering of the temperature for the most rapid rate of hardening, and an increase in rate for the higher-temperature conventional hypoeutectoid reaction. Of the ternary additions, Fe, Ni, and Cr have the least effect, Pt and Pd have an intermediate effect, and Mo the largest. The addition of 5 w/o Ta to the Zr-15Nb base alloy resulted in the formation of a completely martensitic structure on quenching from the beta field, and the addition of oxygen by the use of sponge Zr resulted in an increase in the rate of all transformations.

Cursory fabrication studies have been performed during the course of the alloy development program in the preparation of sheet specimens for studies of the transformation kinetics. All the Zr-Nb-X alloys have been hot-rolled from 800°C quite successfully. A sponge-base Zr-15Nb arc casting has been successfully extruded at 950°C to form rods. While the fabrication techniques developed are adequate for the production of specimen material, they are not necessarily optimum for the commercial production of plate, sheet, bar, rod, and wire in these alloys.

Psi with no elongation was obtained on specimens beta-quenched and aged at 400°C for 2 hr. Similar specimens aged at 500°C for 2 weeks and measured at room temperature had an ultimate strength of 150,000 psi and an elongation of 16% in one inch.

5-8. 7 Inspection of metals by nondestructive testing methods. Of the several methods of nondestructive inspection, a visual examination, aided by contrast dye or fluorescent penetrant, can be used to detect very fine surface cracks or other surface flaws. Radiography with penetrating radiation is used, especially for weldments, to inspect the interior of materials. Such tests are limited in that unfavorably oriented cracks and laminations are very difficult to detect, and the methods are slow and expensive. Ultrasonic methods are not subject to the same limitations as radiography. Defects which are oriented unfavorably for radiography are often readily detected by pulse-echo ultrasonic inspection.

An immersed, pulse-echo, ultrasonic technique developed in the Nondestructive Test Development Laboratory for inspecting tubular products utilizes water as a coupling medium for the ultrasound. A very short pulse of 5-megacycle ultrasonic energy is directed through the water and into the wall of the tube under inspection. The tube is rotated while the source of the ultrasound, a lithium-sulfate transducer, is moved along the tube. The angle at which the sound is incident upon the tube wall is carefully adjusted, and echoes from defects are amplified and processed with commercial equipment. This instrumentation includes an “A scan," which is a cathode-ray tube presentation of echo amplitude on a horizontal time base, and a “B scan," which presents time on the vertical sweep; the horizontal sweep represents the rotation of the tubing being inspected, and the echo amplitude is indicated by brilliance. The “B scan" presentation is used as a visual aid in the interpretation of the ultrasonic reflections. These echoes are compared with the echoes from internal and external notches of known depth in identical tubing in order to estimate the depth of the flaw that causes the echo.

A remote ultrasonic technique is used to monitor the thickness of the HRE-2 core vessel without the necessity for access to both sides of the vessel wall. The method consists of introducing a swept-frequency beam of ultrasound into the wall of the vessel, which is thereby induced into vibration.

Vibration at its resonant frequency and harmonics thereof. The resonances are sensed by the exciting transducer, and the signals from the resonances are amplified, processed, and displayed on a cathode-ray tube. In most cases, layers of corrosion products inside the vessel are not included in the thickness measured, and therefore, the measurement represents the thickness of sound, uncorroded metal. However, a slight increase (3 to 6 mils) has been noted in the tank thickness since it was installed, and the reactor operated. It is not known whether this is due to experimental inaccuracies, changes in the metal, or the presence of scale.

Simple shapes such as small-diameter tubing can be tested very rapidly by eddy-current methods. Such methods have been developed and used at ORNL to identify and sort various metals, to determine the thickness of clad or plated layers, to make rapid dimensional measurements of tubing, and to detect flaws in thin metal sections. Because of the large number of variables which affect eddy-current inspections, the results of these tests must be very carefully evaluated.

Radiation effects in pressure vessel steels. The fast-neutron dose experienced by an aqueous homogeneous reactor pressure vessel during its lifetime may be greater than 5 x 10^8 neutrons/cm.

For several years, the Homogeneous Reactor Project has supported investigations of an exploratory nature to determine the influence of radiation effects on pressure vessel steels. Although it is not yet possible to give definitive answers to many of the questions posed, it has become apparent that radiation effects in steels depend upon a large number of factors, and the unusual properties of irradiated metals may force a reappraisal of the usual standards for predicting service performance from mechanical property data.

Table 5-18 lists the tensile properties of a number of irradiated pressure vessel steels and one weld. At doses of 1 X 10^7 fast neutrons/cm, very large changes in properties are observed, and the steels seem unsuited for use in pressure vessels in this condition because of the limited ductility. Uniform elongation has been used as a measure of tensile ductility because irradiation reduces the uniform elongation much more drastically than the necking elongation.

Heat irradiation can cause a fast increase or decrease in steel ductility. The transition temperature (Tr) is a 2nd order phase change. Neutron flux is measured in neutrons/cm^2, and energy is measured in % of absorbed energy.

The effect of elevated irradiation temperatures is to reduce the yield stress increase, but the tensile strength increase may be greater under the higher temperature conditions. The uniform elongation is usually greater for elevated temperatures of irradiation. In some cases, the reduction of area is drastically reduced by elevated temperature irradiations, and fracture has occurred without necking.

Table 5-19 lists selected data on the effects of irradiation on the notch-impact properties of a number of steels. The increase in transition temperature and the percentage of loss of energy absorption are shown as a function of neutron dose. The data were obtained on subsize Izod impact specimens. Thus, there may be a size effect to be considered.

Preliminary results indicate that elevated irradiation temperatures invariably reduce the extent of radiation effects on the notch-impact properties, although the amount of reduction varies greatly between different steels of similar composition and heat treatment.

There is some tendency for alloy steels (particularly when heat-treated to obtain a structure that is not pearlitic) to show more severe radiation effects than pearlitic steels. This is not to say that alloy steels are unsuitable, but there are insufficient data to choose between the various. In addition, there may be some concern about the use of austenitic stainless steels in high-temperature reactors because of their tendency to form carbides during irradiation. This could lead to a loss of ductility and creep resistance.

The effects of static and cyclic stresses during irradiation on dynamic and static properties have not yet been determined, and it is impossible to perform a realistic evaluation of engineering properties until some information is available.

In the range of neutron doses to be expected in reactor vessels, the properties of irradiated steels are extremely sensitive to dose (and perhaps to dose rate). One of the greatest uncertainties is the comparison of the effectiveness of test reactor fluxes and fluxes to be encountered in service. Also, nothing is known about the rate of self-annealing at the temperature. The effects of irradiation on mechanical properties are complex and not well understood. It has been found that irradiation causes a decrease in yield strength, an increase in tensile ductility, and a decrease in hardness. These changes are believed to be due to the formation of dislocations and precipitates in the metal matrix.

Introduction: Early in the Homogeneous Reactor Project, the susceptibility of austenitic stainless steels to failure by stress-corrosion cracking was recognized. As a result, test exposures of various kinds have been carried out in laboratory glassware, high-temperature autoclaves, 100-gpm dynamic loops, and in-pile loops. The presence of iodide and bromide ions has also resulted in localized attack in some tests. However, bromide ions are an unlikely contaminant and are produced in very low yield in fission, and the iodide formed can be removed by a silver bed.

Thus, the successful utilization of austenitic stainless steels in homogeneous reactor construction is dependent on the control of localized attack, particularly stress-corrosion cracking, by the rigid exclusion or continuous removal of halide ions.

Which emphasizes the necessity for halide control in homogeneous reactor fluids contained in type-347 stainless steel are presented. In general, the effects of the presence of chloride ions are similar to those encountered in high-temperature water. Stress-corrosion cracking problems in such environments in water-cooled reactors have been comprehensively reviewed in the Corrosion and Wear Handbook [154] and so will not be considered in any detail here.

5-9. 2 Fuel systems. An early investigation of stress-corrosion cracking in boiling uranyl-sulfate solutions involved exposure of stress specimens in a small, atmospheric pressure, total reflux test evaporator constructed of type-347 stainless steel. Four constant-strain type-347 stainless-steel specimens stressed to 20,000 psi by three-point loading were exposed in the solution and vapor phase. The evaporator was run without aeration other than that resulting from the fact that the condenser was open to the atmosphere. 6-9. 1 Fuel elements. In a series of tests conducted at Oak Ridge National Laboratory, stress-corrosion cracking in type-304 stainless steel fuel elements was investigated. The tests were conducted under simulated reactor conditions and involved exposure of specimens to boiling uranyl-sulfate solutions. Three types of specimens were used: (1) unstressed, (2) stress-relieved, and (3) cold-worked. 7-9. 1 Fuel elements. 8-9. 1 Fuel elements. 9-9. 1 Fuel elements.

No cracking of any of the specimens was observed during the 7630-hr. Two of the specimens, one from the liquid and one from the vapor phase, were replaced with new specimens, and the test was continued but with 60 ppm of chloride added to the solution as sodium chloride. On examination of the specimens after 500-hr exposure in this environment, several small cracks were found in the area of maximum stress of the new solution-exposed specimen. No cracks were found on the new vapor-exposed specimen nor on any of the carryover specimens.

Further investigations of this pre-treatment effect in boiling uranyl sulfate solutions in glass equipment with elastically stressed U-bend specimens have confirmed the results obtained in the evaporator test. Table 5-20 summarizes some of the information which has been obtained on the effect of pre-treatment in a non-chloride-containing uranyl sulfate solution on the resistance to cracking of stress specimens in subsequent exposure to an environment which is an aggressive crack producer in new specimens. Thus, pre-treatment for a period as short as 50 hr has an appreciable effect also; stressing the specimen after pre-treatment does not destroy the efficacy of the solution pre-treatment. A similar beneficial effect is observed when the specimen is stressed in a tensile test machine instead of being bent around a U-bend.

The results of some laboratory studies on the effect of chloride concentration on stress-corrosion cracking of type-347 stainless steel, not pretreated, in aerated, boiling uranyl sulfate solutions are summarized in Table 5-21. Under these conditions, no cracking of simple beam-type specimens was observed.

Specimens were observed with chloride concentrations of 10 ppm or less over a period of 2500 hr. The exposure-time intervals, after which microscope examination revealed the first evidence of cracking, ranged from a few experiments with added bromide and iodide ions are also given. The bromide results are suggestive of a relatively unusual stress-accelerated corrosion rather than cracking.

Other tests carried out in autoclaves with oxygen overpressure have indicated that chloride concentrations as low as 5 to 10 ppm can cause stress-corrosion cracking of vapor phase specimens at temperatures of 100 and 250°C. Similar specimens exposed in the solution phase suffered no comparable attack even with chloride concentrations ranging up to 90 ppm.

A further seeming inconsistency is the large number of hours (>300,000) of operating experience accumulated on 100-gpm dynamic loops without experiencing a failure due to stress-corrosion cracking, in spite of the fact that a few ppm of chloride was often present in the solution. In a number of instances, 50 to 200 ppm chloride ion was deliberately added to the solution used in a particular run. The same loops were run for many thousands of hours subsequently without stress-cracking failure.

However, as more complex equipment has been operated in connection with the component development programs, a few stress-cracking failures have been encountered. These were usually associated with crevices stemming either from the design or formed by accumulations of solid corrosion products.

In the first of these, at 250°C, two sets of five stress specimens; one set pretreated in situ for 98 hours with chloride-free solution, the other set in the as-machined, degreased condition, were exposed in the loop pressurizer. The specimens were arranged so the topmost specimen was exposed to vapor only, the next two were in the solution spray from the pressurizer bypass, and the bottom two were immersed in the liquid phase. No effect attributable to the exposure position was observed. Pretreated specimens were not included in the second series of runs at 200°C. Table 5-22 summarizes the conditions used in the runs and the results obtained.

At 250°C, no cracks were produced in the specimens by varying conditions from high oxygen concentration to oxygen exhaustion with consequent uranium precipitation. The probability that this was the crevice-type attack, which had been hypothesized, was borne out by the results of the subsequent oxygen exhaustion run. After this run, all the specimens showed transgranular cracks. However, the cracks were not characteristically related to the pattern of applied stress.

The aggressive stress cracking encountered in the oxygen exhaustion run at 200°C raised the question of whether similar effects might be produced in the absence of chloride. Consequently, oxygen exhaustion studies were carried out in loop runs with 0. 17 M uranyl sulfate solutions containing less than 3 ppm of chloride ions. Stress specimens exposed in such runs at 200, 250, and 280°C showed no stress-corrosion cracks on metallographic examination.

In-pile experience has necessarily been substantially less extensive; however, the results have been consistent with the negative experience encountered with out-of-pile loops. Over a period of 24 years, about 17,000 operating hours have been accumulated in fifteen type-347 stainless steel in-pile loop experiments without encountering evidence of stress cracking. Also, stress specimens were exposed in the pressurizer vapor and liquid locations in one 1700-hr experiment. Subsequent microscopic and metallographic examination revealed no evidence of cracks.

5-9. 3 Slurry systems. Substantially less experience with aqueous slurries than with uranyl sulfate solutions has been accumulated in austenitic stainless steel equipment. However, it appears that stress-corrosion cracking failures manifest themselves about as one might expect from high-temperature water results. Thus, the presence or absence and the concentration of chloride in the slurry are major factors in stress-cracking.

Stress cracking has been encountered in toroids and loops operated with oxygenated thorium-oxide slurries containing chloride. No estimate of the concentration of chloride which is tolerable in oxygenated slurries can be made from available data. Williams and Eckel have reported an apparent relationship between oxygen and chloride content for the development of cracks by alkaline-phosphate treated boiler water. These data indicate that maintenance of oxygen at concentrations of less than 0. 5 to 1 ppm will provide reasonable assurance against stress-corrosion cracking at appreciable (10 to ~100 ppm) chloride concentrations. As a result, it has been suggested that elimination of oxygen from slurry systems by maintenance of a hydrogen overpressure on the system may be a solution to the stress-cracking problems. A few test results indicate that this may indeed be true under some out-of-pile conditions; however, it is not likely to be effective under all environmental conditions encountered in an operating reactor.

Thus, it is not clear that a hydrogen overpressure over the radioactive aqueous fluids encountered in an operating reactor will entirely repress the formation of oxygen by radiolytic decomposition of the water or that other species resulting from radiation effects cannot carry out the function of the oxygen in the stress-cracking mechanism if the oxygen is eliminated.

Unresolved questions in the operation of such reactors. McLain [169] has reviewed the problems attendant on the use of conventional boiler water treatment. These problems stem from very large radiation fluxes associated with the radioactive fuel circulating in the primary side of the exchanger. Radiation decomposition of inhibitors such as hydrazine and sulfite and the consequent, and perhaps unpreventable, production of some oxygen by water decomposition introduce completely novel factors to a long-standing problem. Thus, stress-corrosion cracking failures originating on the secondary side of the type-347 heat-exchanger tubes are of concern unless rigid chloride exclusion can be maintained. The effectiveness of inhibitors in preventing the production of appreciable oxygen in the secondary side water of a fluid fuel heat exchanger is one of the investigational objectives of the HRE-2. It is probable, however, that in the future duplex 347-Inconel tubing, with the Inconel in contact with the secondary water environment, will be used in this application.

The comprehensive investigation of stress corrosion cracking in chloride-containing boiler water environments carried out in connection with the Naval Pressurized Water Reactor program has shown that Inconel is not susceptible to cracking failure.

Other secondary systems. Chloride should also be excluded from other aqueous environments in contact with austenitic stainless equipment not easily replaceable. Thus, failures have been encountered in using chlorinated potable water as cooling water [170], and the presence of marking ink containing from 3,000 to 18,000 ppm chloride on the surface of stress U-bend specimen has been shown to induce cracking on exposure to saturated oxygenated steam at 300°C [171]. The undetected chloride contamination during manufacture of some of the tubing used in fabrication of the system resulted in a rapid succession of failures in parts of the system during shakedown operation. Subsequent penetrant and metallographic examination of the O-ring flanges to which the system was connected revealed stress-corrosion cracks in many of those exposed to high temperatures. As a result, all the high-temperature flanges were replaced before the reactor operation schedule could be continued [172, 173].

One of the principal advantages of fluid fuel reactors is the possibility of continually processing the fuel and blanket material for the removal of fission products and other poisons and the recovery of fissionable material produced. Such continuous processing accomplishes several desirable objectives: (a) improvement of the neutron economy sufficiently that the reactor breeds more fissionable material than it consumes; (b) minimization of the hazards associated with the operation of the reactor by maintaining a low concentration of radioactive material in the fuel; and (c) improvement of the life of equipment and stability of the fuel solution by removing deleterious fission and corrosion products. The performance and operability of a homogeneous reactor are considerably more dependent on the processing cycle than are those of a solid fuel reactor, although the objectives of processing are similar.

The neutron poisoning in a homogeneous reactor from which fission product gases are removed continuously is largely due to rare earths, as shown in [1]. In [1], the rare earths contributing to reactor poisoning are divided into two groups. The time-dependent rare earths are those of high yield and intermediate cross-section, such as Nd143 and Nd145, Pr141, and Pm147, which over a period of several months could accumulate in the reactor and result in a poisoning of about 20%.

Schematic flowsheets for proposed processing schemes for two types of two-region aqueous homogeneous reactors are shown in Figs. 6-2 and 6-3. In both cases, solids are removed by hydroclones and concentrated into a small volume of solution for further processing. The nature of such processing will be determined by the exact design and purpose of the reactor. Thus, for a two-region plutonium producer, the core and blanket materials would have to be processed separately to avoid isotopic dilution, while for a thorium breeder, core and blanket material could be processed together. However, if an attractive method should be developed for leaching uranium and/or protactinium from a thorium-oxide slurry without seriously altering the physical properties of the slurry, the two materials could be processed separately. In a similar way, the relation between iodine control and fission product gas disposal is such that neither problem can be disassociated from the other. A specific, complete, and feasible chemical processing scheme cannot be proposed for any reactor without an intimate knowledge of all aspects of design and operation of the reactor.

Introduction: Early in the study of the behavior of fission and corrosion products in uranyl sulfate solutions at temperatures in the range of 250 to 325°C, it was found that many of these elements had only a limited solubility under reactor conditions. Detailed studies of these elements were conducted, and devices for separating solids from liquid at high temperature and pressure were constructed and evaluated. Based on this work, a pilot plant to test a processing concept based on solids separation at reactor temperature was installed as an adjunct to the HRE-2. These processing developments are discussed in this section.

In a mixture of rare-earth sulfates, the solubility of an individual rare earth is less than it would be if it were present alone. Samples of the precipitating salts isolated from the solution at 280°C have usually been the sulfates and contained no uranium.

Solution: The solubility of barium sulfate is 7 mg/kg H2O, while that of strontium sulfate is 21 mg/kg H2O. Both the alkaline and rare-earth sulfates exhibit a strong tendency to precipitate on and adhere to steel surfaces at temperatures exceeding those of the precipitating solutions. This characteristic can be leveraged to separate these solids from liquids under high-temperature conditions.

Other fission and corrosion product elements hydrolyze extensively at 250 to 300°C and precipitate as oxides, leaving very low concentrations in solution. Iron(III) at 285°C has a solubility of 0. 5 to 2 mg Fe/kg H2O, and chromium(III) 2 to 5 mg/kg H2O. At 285°C, less than 5 mg of zirconium or niobium per kilogram of H2O remains in solution.

For other elements of variable valence, such as technetium, the amount of the element in solution is determined by the stable valence state. Under is reduced to Tc(IV) if hydrogen is present, and only 12 mg/kg H2O remains in solution. However, a slurry of TcOz in the same solution, but with oxygen present, dissolves to give a solution at 275°C with a technetium concentration of more than 9 g/kg H2O. The same qualitative behavior is observed with ruthenium. Selenium and tellurium in the hexapositive state are much more soluble than when in the tetrapositive state.

6-2. 3 Experimental study of hydroclone performance. It is evident from the preceding section that the amount of uranium withdrawn from the reactor diminishes if the collection, concentration, and isolation of the insolubles can be effected at high temperature. One device capable of collecting and concentrating solids at high temperature is a solid-liquid cyclone separator called a "hydroclone," or "clone. " A diagram of a hydroclone is shown in Figure 4. In operation, a solids-bearing stream of liquid is injected tangentially into the wide portion of a conical vessel. Solids concentrate in a downward-moving layer of liquid and are discharged from the bottom of the clone into the underflow receiver. Partially clarified liquid leaves from the top of the clone through a vortex finder. The driving force for the system is provided by a mechanical pump.

Based on these studies, hydroclones have been tested in the laboratory and on various circulating loops. All tests have shown conclusively that such hydroclones can separate insoluble sulfates or hydrolyzed materials from liquid streams at 250 to 300°C. In the HRE-2 mockup loop, a mixture of the sulfates of iron, zirconium, and various rare earths dissolved in uranylsulfate solution at room temperature precipitated when injected into the loop solution at 250 to 300°C. The solids concentrated into the underflow receiver of a hydroclone contained 75% of the precipitated rare-earth sulfates. When the lanthanum-sulfate solubility in the loop solution was exceeded by 10%, the concentration of rare earths in the underflow receiver was four to six times greater than in the rest of the loop system. Some accumulation of rare earths was observed in the loop heater. A large fraction of the hydrolyzed iron and zirconium was collected in the gas separator portion of the loop. In the separator, the centrifugal motion given to the liquid forced solids to the periphery of the pipe and allowed them to accumulate. Only about 10% of the solids formed in the loop was recovered by the hydroclone, and examination of the loop system disclosed large quantities of solids settled in every horizontal run of pipe.

Samples taken from the loop after the addition of preformed solids and without as a feed for the plant, the half-times for solids disappearance and removal were 11 hr without the hydroclone and 1. 5 hr with it. The efficiency of the hydroclone for separating the particular solids used in these experiments was about 10%. With gross amounts of solids in the system, concentration factors have been as large as 1700.

Correlation of these data with anticipated reactor chemical plant operating conditions indicates that the HRE-2 chemical plant will hold the amount of solids in the fuel solution to between 10 and 100 ppm. If necessary, performance can be improved by increasing the flow through the chemical plant and by eliminating, wherever possible, long runs of horizontal pipe with low liquid velocity and other stagnant areas which serve to accumulate solids.

A 0. 75-gpm bypass stream from the reactor fuel system at 280°C and 1700 psi is circulated through the high-pressure system, consisting of a heater to make up heat losses; a screen to protect the hydroclone from plugging; the hydroclone with underflow receiver; and a canned-rotor circulating pump to make up pressure losses across the system. The hydroclone is operated with an underflow receiver which is drained after each week of operation, at which time the processing plant is isolated from the reactor system.

At the conclusion of each operating period, 10 liters of the slurry in the underflow pot are removed and sampled. The heavy water is evaporated and recovered, and the solids are dissolved in sulfuric acid and sampled again. The solution is then transferred under pressure to one of two 100-gal decay storage tanks. Following a three-month decay period, the solution is transferred to a shielded carrier outside the cell and then to an existing solvent extraction plant at Oak Ridge National Laboratory for uranium decontamination and recovery. The sulfuric acid solution step is incorporated in the HRE-2 chemical plant to ensure obtaining a satisfactory sample.

All equipment is located in a 12- by 24- by 21-ft underground cell located adjacent to the reactor cell and separated from it by 4 ft of high-density concrete. Other construction features are similar to those of the reactor cell, with provisions for flooding the cell during maintenance periods in order to use water as shielding. Figure 6-6, a photograph of the cell prior to installation of the roof plugs, shows the maze of piping necessitated by the experimental nature of this plant.

Selected to handle the range of possible particle sizes are interchangeable at any time during radioactive operation through a unique, specially machined flange shown in Figure 7. Removal of the blind closure flange exposes a cap plug and retainer plug. Removal of these with long-handled socket wrenches permits access to the hydroclone itself. This operation has been performed routinely during testing with nonradioactive solutions.

In processing homogeneous reactor fuel, a transition from a heavy- to a natural-water system is desirable if final processing is to be performed in conventional solvent extraction equipment. Such a transition must be accomplished with a minimum loss of D2O and a minimum contamination of the product stream.

The fuel solution by H2O in recycled fuel. Initial tests of this step in the fuel processing cycle have been carried out. In these experiments, a mixture of 5% D2O, 95% H2O was used to simulate reactor fuel liquid. The dissolver system was cycled three times between this liquid and ordinary water, with samples being taken during each portion of each cycle. Isotopic analysis of these samples showed no dilution of the D2O in the enriched solution and no loss of D2O to the ordinary water system.

At expected corrosion rates, approximately 400 g of corrosion products will be formed in the reactor system per week, and the underflow receiver was therefore designed to handle this quantity of solids. The adequacy of the design was shown when more than three times this quantity of solids was charged to the underflow receiver and drained in the normal way without difficulty.

Full-scale dissolution procedures have also been tested. This consists of a 4-hr reflux with 10. 8 M H2SO4 in a tantalum-lined dissolver followed by a 4-hr reflux with 4M H2SO4, and repeated as required until dissolution is complete. Decay storage tanks and other equipment required to handle the boiling 4 M H2SO4 are fabricated of Carpenter-20 stainless steel. Tests have repeatedly demonstrated more than 99. 5% dissolution of simulated corrosion and fission products in two such cycles.

The HRE-2 hydroclone system has been operated as an integral part of the reactor system for approximately 600 hours and for an additional 1200 hours with a temporary pump loop during initial solids-removal tests. During this operating period, in which simulated nonradioactive fuel solutions were used, the performance of the plant was satisfactory in all respects.

6-3. 1 Introduction. To prevent the pollution of the atmosphere by radioactive krypton and xenon isotopes released from the fuel solution, a system of containment must be provided until radioactive decay has reduced their activity level. This is accomplished by a method based on the process of physical adsorption on solid adsorber materials. If the adsorber system is adequately designed, the issuing gas stream will be composed of long-lived Kr, oxygen, inert krypton isotopes, inert xenon isotopes, and insignificant amounts of other radioactive krypton and xenon isotopes.

Experimental study of the adsorption of fission product gases is ongoing. The evaluation of different adsorber materials is based on experimental measurements of the equilibrium adsorption of krypton or xenon under static conditions. Results, in the form of adsorption isotherms of various solid adsorber materials, are presented in Figure 8.

A radioactive tracer technique was developed to study the adsorption efficiency (holdup time) of small, dynamic, laboratory-scale adsorber systems. This consists of sweeping a brief pulse of Kr through an experimental adsorber system with a diluent gas such as oxygen or nitrogen.

And monitoring the effluent gases for Kr beta activity. The activity in the gas stream versus time after injection of the pulse of Kr-5 is recorded. A plot of the data gives an experimental elution curve, such as shown in Figure 9, from which various properties of an adsorber material and adsorber system may be evaluated.

Among the factors which influence the adsorption of fission product gases from a dynamic system are (1) adsorptive capacity of adsorber material; (2) temperature of adsorber material; (3) volume flow rate of gas stream; (4) adsorbed moisture content of adsorber material; (5) composition and moisture content of gas stream; (6) geometry of adsorber system; and (7) particle size of adsorber material. The average time required for the fission product gas to pass through an adsorber system, tmax, is influenced by the first five of the above factors. The shape of the experimental elution curve is affected by the last two.

All solid adsorbers have some affinity for moisture, which can reduce their effectiveness in capturing fission gases. Any moisture that is adsorbed on the surface of the adsorbent reduces the available active surface area for the fission gases and thus increases the average holdup time.

The geometry of the adsorber system influences the relation between breakthrough time, f&, and average holdup time, tmax, as shown in Figure 9. For a given mass of adsorber material, a system composed of long, small-diameter pipes will have a small difference between t and tmax, whereas a system composed of short, large-diameter pipes will not.

The particle size of the adsorber material is important for ensuring intimate contact between the active surface of the adsorber material and the fission gases. A system filled with large particles will allow some molecules to pass through without being captured, while a system filled with small particles will result in more efficient capture of the desired species.

Cules of fission gases tend to penetrate deeper into the system before contact is made with an active surface, while the pressure drop across a long trap filled with small particles may be excessive. Material between 8 and 14 mesh in size is satisfactory from both viewpoints.

6-3. 3 Design of a fission product gas adsorber system. The design of an adsorber system will be determined partly by the final disposition of the effluent gas mixture. If ultimate disposal is to be to the atmosphere, the adsorber system should be designed to discharge only Kr plus inert krypton and xenon isotopes.

The operating characteristics of the reactor will dictate the composition and volume flow rate of the gas stream. Tmax will be determined by the allowable concentration of radioactivity in the effluent gas. K values for krypton and xenon must be determined experimentally under conditions simulating those in the full-scale adsorber system. It should be noted that a portion of the fission gas will emerge from the adsorber system at a time prior to the average holdup time, Tmax. The design should ensure that radioactive gas emerging at time t has decayed sufficiently so that only insignificant amounts of activity other than Kr will be discharged from the bed.

The adsorber system should be operated at the lowest convenient temperature because of the dependence of adsorptive capacity on temperature. Beta decay of the fission product gases while passing through the adsorber system will increase the temperature of the adsorber material and reduce the adsorptive capacity.

6-3. 4 HRE-2 fission product gas adsorber system.

The adsorber system contains two activated charcoal-filled units connected in parallel to the gas line from the reactor. Each unit consists of a pipe connected in series. The entire system is contained in a water-filled pit, which is buried underground for gamma shielding purposes. Each unit is filled with approximately 520 lb of Columbia G activated charcoal.

The heat due to beta decay of the short-lived krypton and xenon isotopes is diminished by an empty holdup volume composed of 160 ft of 3-in. pipe between the reactor and the charcoal adsorber system. This prevents the temperature of the charcoal in the inlet sections of the adsorber system from exceeding 100°C. Excessive oxidation of the charcoal by the oxygen in the gas is further prevented by water-cooling the beds.

Before the adsorber system was placed in service, its efficiency was tested under simulated operating conditions. In this way, the krypton holdup time was determined to be 30 days at an oxygen flow rate of 250 cc/min/unit. Based on laboratory data from small adsorber systems, the holdup time for xenon is larger than that for krypton by a factor that varies from 30 to 7 over the temperature range of 20 to 100°C. From these data, it is estimated that the maximum temperature of the HRE-2 adsorber system will vary between 20 and 98°C after the reactor has been operating at 10 MW power level long enough for the gas composition and charcoal temperature to have reached equilibrium through the entire length of the adsorber unit. The calculated holdup time was found to be 23 days for krypton and 700 days for xenon, which would permit essentially no Xe-133 to escape from the trap.

Fuel than it consumes. Therefore, a volume of fuel solution sufficient to process the core solution of the reactor at a desired rate for removal of soluble materials is discharged along with the insoluble materials concentrated into the hydroclone underflow pot. For example, operation of an iodine removal plant (Section 6-5) reduces the buildup of cesium in the fuel to an insignificant value by removing cesium precursors.

The amount of uranium to be processed daily is so small that the operation of a solvent extraction plant solely for core solution processing would be unduly expensive. Therefore, the core solution would typically be combined with blanket material from a thermal breeder reactor and processed through a Thorex plant. However, with a plutonium-producing reactor, separate processing of core and blanket materials will be required. These process schemes are extensively discussed in Sections 6-6 and 6-7.

The uranium product from either process would certainly be satisfactory for return to the reactor. Since solid fuel element refabrication is not a problem with homogeneous reactors, decontamination factors of 10 to 100 from various nuclides are adequate, and some simplification of present solvent extraction schemes may be possible.

6-4. 3 Uranyl peroxide precipitation. A process for decontaminating the uranium for quick return to a reactor has been proposed as a means of reducing core processing costs. A conceptual flowsheet of this process, which depends on the insolubility of UO4 under controlled conditions for the desired separation from fission and corrosion products, is shown in Figure 10. A prerequisite for use of this scheme is that losses due to the insoluble uranium contained in the solids concentrated in the hydroclone plant be small. However, laboratory data obtained with synthetic solids simulating those expected from reactor operation indicate that the uranium content of the solids will be less than 1% by weight. Verification of the results will be sought during operation of the HRE-2.

In the proposed method, the hydroclone system is periodically isolated from the reactor and allowed to cool to 100°C. The hydrolyzed solids remain as such, but the rare-earth sulfate solids concentrated in the underflow pot redissolve upon cooling. The contents of the underflow pot are discharged to a centrifuge where solids are separated from the uranium-containing solution and washed with D2O; the suspension is then sent to a waste evaporator for the recovery of D2O.

Uranium in the clarified solution is precipitated by the addition of either D2O2 or Na2O2. By controlling pH and precipitation conditions, a fast-settling precipitate can be obtained with less than 0. 1% of the uranium remaining in solution. The UO2 precipitate is centrifuged or filtered, washed with D2O, and dissolved in 50% excess of D2SO4 at 80°C before being returned to the reactor.

In laboratory studies, uranium losses have been consistently less than 0. 1% for this method, and decontamination factors from rare earths greater than 10. Decontamination factors from nickel and cesium have been 600 and 40, respectively. It is estimated that the product returned to the reactor would contain about 20 ppm of sodium as the only contaminant introduced during processing. Although either the addition of D2O or the use of D2O generated by radiation from the solution itself appears attractive, acid liberated by the precipitation of UOs must be neutralized if uranium losses are to be minimized. Since the entire operation is done in a D2O system, no special precautions to avoid contaminating the reactor with ordinary water are needed.

6-5. 1 Introduction. The removal of iodine from the fuel solution of a homogeneous reactor is desirable from the standpoint of minimizing the biological hazard and neutron poisoning due to iodine and reducing the production of gaseous xenon and its associated problems.

Poison platinum catalysts are used for radiolytic gas recombination in the reactor low-pressure system and may catalyze the corrosion of metals by the fuel solution. For this reason, a considerable effort has been carried out at ORNL and by Vitro to investigate the behavior of iodine in solution and to develop methods for its removal. In this regard, the iodine isotopes of primary interest are 8-day I91 and 6. 7-hr.

6-5. 2 The chemistry of iodine in aqueous solutions. The stable species are iodide ion, I2 elemental iodine, I2 iodate, IO3- and periodate, IO4- or H5IO6. The last of these exists only under very strongly oxidizing conditions, and is immediately reduced under the conditions expected for a homogeneous reactor fuel. Iodide ion can be formed from reduction of other states by metals, such as stainless steel, but in the presence of the oxygen necessary in a reactor system, it is readily converted to elemental iodine. This conversion is especially rapid above 200°C. Thus the only states of concern in reactor fuel solutions are elemental iodine and iodate.

Volatility of iodine. Since the volatile elemental state of iodine is predominant under reactor conditions, the volatility of iodine from fuel solution is the basis for proposed iodine-removal processes. The vapor-liquid distribution coefficient (ratio of mole fraction of iodine in vapor to that in liquid) for simulated fuel solution and for water at the temperatures expected for both the high-pressure and low-pressure systems of homogeneous reactors is given in Table 6-6.

A number of conclusions are evident from these data. Iodine is much more volatile from a fuel solution than from water at either temperature. Fission and corrosion products appear to increase the volatility of iodine from the fuel solution at 100°C. No systematic variation of iodine volatility has been found with iodine concentration in the range 1 to 100 ppm or temperature in the range 260 to 330°C.

The volatility of iodine from a simulated fuel solution has been verified by experiments in a high-pressure loop, as shown schematically in Figure 11. The circulating solution was contacted with oxygen in the ejector, and the separated gas was stripped of iodine by passing through a bed of silvered alundum, which was superheated to prevent steam condensation. Potassium iodide solution (containing a radioactive tracer, I-131) was rapidly injected into the loop to give an iodine concentration of 10 ppm. Table 6-7 gives the half-times for iodine removal and the volatility distribution coefficient, calculated from the removal rate and the flow rates, based on three experiments with clean fuel solution and two with added iron. Within the accuracy of flow rate measurement, the coefficient was consistent among all five experiments.

The extent of this decomposition in uranyl-sulfate solutions above 200°C is not known with certainty, since all observations have been made on samples that have been withdrawn from the system, cooled, and reduced in pressure before analysis. Although the iodine in such samples is principally elemental, some iodate is always present, possibly because of the reversal of the iodate decomposition as the temperature drops in the sample at elevated temperatures. In addition, iodide similarly disappears if an overpressure of oxygen is present, although iodide to the extent of 40% of the total iodine has been found in the absence of added oxygen.

The strongest indication of iodate instability was in the loop experiments, which gave the highest observed iodine/iodate ratio, even though iodine was continuously introduced into the flowing stream as iodate and removed by oxygen scrubbing as elemental iodine. The low iodate content of the samples from these experiments corresponded to a first-order iodate decomposition rate constant of 6. 2 min-1. Iodate contents averaging about 10% of the total iodine have been observed in a static bomb through an ice-cooled titanium sample line. The observed whether or not the solution was exposed to cobalt gamma radiation at an intensity of 1. 7 watts/kg.

Oxidation state of iodine at low temperatures. At 100°C, the iodate decomposition and iodine oxidation are too slow for equilibrium to be established in reasonable periods of time. Thus, both states can persist under similar conditions. In stainless-steel equipment, both states are reduced to iodide, which is oxidized to iodine if oxygen or iodate is present.

In a radiation field, iodide is oxidized; iodine is oxidized if sufficient oxygen is present, and iodate is reduced [13]. At the start of irradiation, iodate is reduced. Still, in the presence of sufficient oxygen, iodine is later reoxidized to iodate, probably by radiation-produced hydrogen peroxide, which accumulates in the solution. Finally, a steady state is reached with a strong dependence on uranium and acid concentrations and on the hydrogen/oxygen ratio in the gas phase. When the temperature is increased to 120°C, there is a marked decrease in iodate stability under all conditions of gas and solution composition. Experimental data on the effects of radiation intensity, temperature, and gas composition for the irradiation of a typical are given in Ref. 13.

Numerous experiments have shown that silver supported on alum is a very effective reagent for removing iodine from gas or vapor systems, although its efficiency is considerably reduced at temperatures below 150°C. Silver-plated Yorkmesh packing is very effective for removing iodine from vapor streams in the range 100 to 120°C. In one in-pile experiment, 90% of the fission-product iodine was concentrated in a silvered-alum pellet suspended in the vapor above a uranyl-sulfate solution. This method of using a solid iodine absorber, however, would present difficult engineering problems since xenon resulting from iodine decay would be expected to leave the absorber and return to the core unless the absorbers were isolated after short periods of use and remotely replaced.

Iodine removal by gas stripping requires a continuous fuel letdown. In case this is not desirable, the vapor can be stripped of iodine in the high-pressure system by contacting with a small volume of liquid which is subsequently discharged. Liquids considered include water and aqueous solutions of alkali, sodium sulfite, or silver sulfate. Although the solutions are much more effective iodine strippers than pure water, their use requires elaborate provision for preventing entrainment in the gas and subsequent contamination of the fuel solution.

One possible iodine-removal scheme uses O2 or O3 + D2 scrubbing. The iodine is scrubbed from the fuel solution by the gas in one contactor and then stripped from the gas by heavy water in a second contactor. This water would then be let down to low pressure and stored for decay or processed to remove iodine.

In most homogeneous reactors, some of the fuel solution is evaporated to provide condensate for purge of the circulating pump and pressurizer. Since iodine is stripped from the fuel by this evaporation, this operation can be used for iodine removal. This method, which is illustrated in [16], has been proposed for the HRE-3. The steam is condensed, and the oxygen is recycled. The condensate is distilled to concentrate the iodine into such a small volume that its letdown does not complicate reactor operation.

Iodine removal in the HRE-2. Iodine adsorption on the platinized alumina recombination catalyst, such as that used in the HRE-2, poisons the catalyst severely. Although the catalyst can be restored by operation at 650°C, this would not be feasible in HRE-2 operation. A method for removing iodine from the gas stream by contact with alundum or Yorkmesh coated with silver was developed in the HRT mockup.

The tank was passed through a silvered alumina bed and the recombiner, and then to a condenser. Condensate was returned to the high-pressure loop through a pressurizer and the circulating pump. 8 mg/liter to 0. 1 mg/liter in 2 hr. The Yorkmesh efficiency depended strongly on how densely it was packed. The iodine removal efficiencies calculated from these experiments and others are given in Table 6-8. In laboratory experiments with a 1-in. -diameter bed, which could not be tightly packed, Yorkmesh efficiencies were consistently poorer than those of silvered alumina.

The ability of a bed of silver-plated Yorkmesh to remove iodine from the reactor system was apparently confirmed during the initial operating period of the HRE-2. Here, the iodine activity in the reactor fuel appeared to be even lower than expected when iodine was removed at the same fractional rate as the fuel solution was let down from the high-pressure system. Less than 3% of the iodine produced during 40 MWh of operation was found in the fuel solution.

6-6. 1 Introduction. The uranyl sulfate blanket solution of a plutonium producer is processed to remove plutonium and to control the neutron poisoning by corrosion and fission products. Although a modified Purex solvent extraction process can be used for plutonium removal, the method shown schematically in -3; based on the low solubility of plutonium in uranyl sulfate solution at 250°C, appears more attractive. The small volume of blanket solution carrying the plutonium is evaporated to recover the heavy water, and the solids are dissolved in nitric acid. After storage to allow Np9 to decay, plutonium is decontaminated by solvent extraction.

6-6. 2 Plutonium chemistry in uranyl sulfate solution. The amount of plutonium remaining dissolved in 1. 4 M UO2SO4 at 250°C is dependent on a number of variables, including solution acidity, plutonium valence, and initial plutonium concentration. Under properly controlled conditions, less than 3 mg/kg H2O has been obtained. Since plutonium is removed from solution by hydrolysis to PuO2, solubilities are increased by increasing the acidity. Table 6-9 summarizes data on the solubility behavior of plutonium for various acidities.

Plutonium behavior is difficult to predict because of its complex valence pattern. In the absence of irradiation, plutonium dissolved in 1. 4m UO2SO4 under a stoichiometric mixture of hydrogen and oxygen at 250°C exists in the tetravalent state. However, when dissolved chromium is present or when an overpressure of pure oxygen is used, part of the plutonium is oxidized to the hexavalent state. Experiments indicate that in the presence of Co gamma irradiation, reducing conditions prevail even under an oxygen pressure, and plutonium is held in the tetravalent state. The valence behavior discussed here is somewhat in question since actual valence measurements were made at room temperature immediately after cooling from 250°C. It is known that tetravalent plutonium will disproportionate upon heating.

When the plutonium concentration exceeds the solubility limit, plutonium will hydrolyze to form small particles of PuO₂ about 0. 5 microns in diameter. In pyrex, quartz, or gold equipment, it forms a loose precipitate with negligible amounts adsorbed on the walls. However, if these solutions are contained in type-347 stainless steel, titanium, or Zircaloy, a large fraction of the PuO₂ adsorbs on and becomes incorporated within the oxide corrosion film. Attempts to saturate these metal surfaces with plutonium in small-scale laboratory experiments were unsuccessful, even though plutonium adsorption was as much as 1 mg/cm².

6-6. 4 Plutonium behavior under simulated reactor conditions. Plutonium behavior in actual uranyl sulfate blanket systems has not been studied; however, small-scale static experiments with 100 ml of solution and circulating loop experiments with 12 liters of solution have been carried out in the absence of irradiation under conditions similar to those expected in an actual reactor.

In the static experiments, plutonium was added batchwise to 1. 4 M UO2SO4 at a rate of about 6 mg/kg H2O/day. The solution was heated overnight in a Pyrex-lined autoclave at 250°C under 200 psi hydrogen and 100 psi oxygen. The solution was cooled to room temperature for analysis and for adding more plutonium. This was repeated until a total of 140 mg of plutonium per kilogram of water was added. Small disks of type-347 stainless steel were suspended in the solution throughout the experiment to determine the amount of plutonium adsorption. The behavior of plutonium for a stainless-steel surface area/solution volume ratio of 0. 6 cm/ml decreased rapidly to about 5 mg/kg H2O. All plutonium added after this was either adsorbed.

Other experiments were made with surface/volume ratios of 0. 2 and 0. 4 cm/ml. In all cases, the plutonium remaining in solution and the plutonium adsorption per square centimeter were essentially the same as that shown in Table III. 6 cm²/ml; 60% for a ratio of 0.

Pressure vessel that could be connected and removed while the loop was in operation. Plutonium was added, and circulating-solution samples were taken through this vessel. Tetrapositive plutonium added to the circulating solution was completely oxidized to hexapositive in less than 5 min. When 45 mg/kg of H2O of dissolved plutonium was added every 8 hr, the amount of plutonium circulating in solution increased to a maximum of about 150 mg/kg of H2O. After the last addition of plutonium, the loop was operated at 250°C for several days. Essentially, all the plutonium removed from the solution was adsorbed on equipment walls uniformly throughout the loop. Less than 0.

The hydroclone underflow, and no precipitated solids were circulating. Even when 850 mg of plutonium as preformed PuO2g was injected into the loop, no circulating solids were detected 5 min later. Only 20% of this plutonium was removed by the hydroclone; 35% was adsorbed on the stainless steel, and the rest was distributed throughout the horizontal sections of the loop as loose solids. The hydroclone was effective for removing solids that reached it, but the loop walls and low velocity in horizontal pipes were effective traps for PuO2.

There are several differences in conditions between loop runs and an actual reactor; the most important of which are probably the presence of radiation, the lower surface/volume ratio (0. 4 compared with 0. 8 cm/ml for the loop), the slower rate of plutonium growth in the reactor (12 to 15 mg/kg H2O/day), and the probability that a plutonium producer would have to be constructed of titanium and Zircaloy to contain the concentrated uranyl-sulfate solution. Based on these laboratory results, however, it appears that plutonium adsorption on metal walls may be a serious obstacle to processing for removal of precipitated PuOe.

6-6. 5 Alternate process methods. Because of the problem of plutonium adsorption on metal walls, removal methods based on plutonium concentrations well below the solubility limit have been considered. In a full-scale reactor, plutonium will be formed at the rate of up to 12 to 15 mg/kg H2O/day. By adding 0. 4 m excess H2SO4 (see Table 6-9), the plutonium solubility is increased to greater than 100 mg/kg H2O, and the blanket processing rate can be decreased to once every 3 or 4 days. Slightly longer processing cycles can be used if part of the plutonium is removed as neptunium before it decays.

Of the various alternate processes considered, ion exchange and adsorption methods show the most promise. Dowex-50 resin, a strongly acidic sulfonic acid resin loaded with UO2, completely removed tetrapositive plutonium from 1. 4m UO2SO4 containing 20 mg of plutonium per liter. The resin capacity under these conditions, however, has not been determined. Because of the high radiation level, it may not be feasible to use organic resins. Sorption of plutonium on inorganic materials shows some possibilities as a processing method. Although rather low plutonium/adsorber ratios have been obtained, indications are that capacities will be significantly higher at higher plutonium concentrations. Special preparation of the adsorbers should also increase capacities.

6-7. 1 Introduction. At present, the only practical method available for processing irradiated thorium-oxide slurry is to convert the oxide to a natural water-thorium nitrate solution and treat it by the Thorex process. Although this method is adequate, it is expensive unless one plant can be built to process thorium oxide from several full-scale power reactors. Therefore, methods for ThO2 reprocessing, which could be economically incorporated into the design and operation of a single power station, have been considered. Alternative methods that have been subjected to only brief scouting-type experimentation are discussed in Article 6-7. 3.

6-7. 2 Thorex process. The Thorex process has been developed to separate thorium, U-233, fission product activities, and Pa-233 to recover the thorium and uranium as aqueous products suitable for further direct handling and to recover isotopically pure U-233 after decay-storage of the Pa-233. The flowsheet includes two solvent-extraction cycles for thorium and three solvent-extraction cycles plus ion exchange for the uranium. Although only irradiated thorium metal has been processed, the process is expected to be satisfactory for recovery of thorium and uranium from homogeneous reactor fuels.

In the feed preparation step, uranyl sulfate solution from the reactor core and thorium oxide from the blanket system, freed of D2O and suspended in ordinary water, are fed into the dissolver tank. The dissolvent is 13 N nitric acid to which has been added catalytic amounts (0. 04 N) of sodium fluoride. When short-cooled thorium is being processed, potassium iodide is added continuously to the dissolver to provide for isotopic dilution of the large amount of fission-produced I!3! which is present. The dissolver solution is continuously sparged with air, and the volatilized iodine is removed from the off-gases in a caustic scrubber.

The dissolver solution is transferred to the feed adjustment tank where aluminum nitrate is added; excess nitric acid is recovered, and the resultant solution made slightly acid-deficient by evaporating until a temperature of 155°C is reached. During digestion in the feed adjustment tank, any silica present is converted to a form that will not cause emulsion problems in pulse columns, and fission products generally are converted to forms less likely to be extracted by the solvent (42% TBP in Amsco).

In the solvent extraction step, thorium and uranium are co-extracted in the first cycle. For short-decayed thorium, a reductant, sodium hydrogen sulfite, is continuously added to the feed streams of both cycles to decrease the effect of nitrite formed by irradiation. Without the sulfite addition, the nitrite formed by radiation decomposition of nitrates converts ruthenium to a solvent-extractable form. Acid deficiency in the second cycle feed is achieved by adding dibasic aluminum nitrate (diban).

In the uranium product concentration and purification step (-16), uranium is isolated by ion exchange, using upflow sorption and downflow elution. In this way, a concentrated uranium solution in 6 N HNO3 is obtained. This solution is stable enough for storage or is suitable as a feed for the third uranium extraction cycle. The third uranium cycle is a standard extraction-stripping solvent-extraction system using 15% TBPAm as the organic extractant. Although installed as a part of the complete Thorex flowsheet, the third cycle may be used separately for reprocessing long-stored uranium to free it of objectionable decay daughters of U32. When used as an integral part of the Thorex scheme, additional decontamination of the uranium is achieved, and the nitrate product is well adapted for extended storage or future reprocessing.

For return to an aqueous homogeneous reactor, the decontaminated uranium would probably be precipitated as the peroxide, washed free of nitrate, and then dissolved in DeSO4 and D2O. Product thorium would be converted to thorium oxide by methods described in Section 4-3.

The adaptability of the Thorex flowsheet just described to processing thorium irradiated to contain larger amounts of U35 per ton and decayed a short time has been demonstrated in the Thorex Pilot Plant at Oak Ridge National Laboratory. Fifteen hundred pounds of thorium irradiated to 3500 grams of U83 per ton and decayed 30 days was processed through two thorium cycles and three uranium cycles. The decontamination factors for various elements achieved with short-decayed material are compared in Table 6-10 with results obtained with longer-decayed material. While the decontamination factors obtained with the short-decayed material compare favorably with the factors for the long-decayed material, the initial activity in the short-decayed thorium was 1000 times greater than in the long-decayed. Therefore, while the thorium and uranium products did not meet tentative specifications after two complete cycles, the uranium product did meet those specifications after the third uranium cycle. Since the chemical operations necessary to convert these materials to forms suitable for use in a homogeneous reactor can be carried out remotely, the products are satisfactory for return to a homogeneous reactor after two cycles.

Alternate processing method: Attempts to leach protactinium and uranium produced in ThO2 particles by neutron irradiation indicate that both are rather uniformly distributed throughout the mass of the ThO2 particle, and migration of such ions at temperatures up to 300°C is extremely slow. Since calculations show that the recoil energy of fragments from U%3 fission is sufficiently large to eject most of them from a particle of ThO2 not larger than 10 microns in diameter, this offers the possibility of separating fission and corrosion products from a slurry of ThO2 without destroying the oxide particles. Such a separation, however, depends on the ability to remove the elements that are subsequently adsorbed on the surface of the ThO2. Adsorption of various cations on ThO2 and methods for their removal are discussed in the following paragraphs.

Trace quantities of such nuclides as Zr, Nd-147, Y-90, and Ru when added to a slurry of ThO2 in water at 250°C are rapidly adsorbed on the oxide particles, leaving less than 10% of the nuclides in solution. The tracer thus adsorbed cannot be eluted with hot dilute nitric or sulfuric acid.

As illustrated in Table 6-11, this change in the amount of adsorption may be almost entirely due to a decrease in the surface area of ThO2 with the increased firing temperature. The surface area of 1600°C-fired ThO2 is only 1 m/g ThO2, while the 650°C-fired ThO2 has a surface area of 35 m/g ThO2.

The cation adsorption on ThO2 can be decreased by co-slurrying some other oxide with the ThO2. The added oxide must adsorb fission products much more strongly than ThO2 and be easily separable from ThO2. When PbO2 was used, more than 99% of the cations added to the ThO2-PbO slurry was adsorbed on the PbO2. However, cations adsorbed on ThO2 were not transferred to PbO2 when it was added to the slurry in which the cations were already adsorbed on the ThO2 particles.

In all cases, cations adsorbed on ThO2 at 250°C are so tightly held that dilute nitric or sulfuric acid, even at boiling temperature, will not remove the adsorbed material. However, the adsorbed ions can be desorbed by refluxing the ThO2 in suitable reagents under such conditions that only a small amount of 1600°C-fired ThO2 is dissolved. Under the same treatment, ThO2 fired to only 650°C would be 90% dissolved.

7-1. 1 Need for reactor construction experience. The power reactor development program in the United States is characterized by the construction of a series of experimental reactors which, it is hoped, will lead to each reactor type an economical full-scale power plant. Outstanding examples of this approach are afforded by the pressurized water reactor and boiling water reactor systems. The development of pressurized water reactors plants and Babcock & Wilcox Company (Consolidated Edison plant).

Although many have argued that the shortest route to economic power will be achieved by eliminating the intermediate-scale plants, most experts believe that eliminating these plants would be more costly in the long run. A reactor embodying some, but not all, the essential features of a full-scale reactor has become an accepted developmental device for reactor technology.

An alternative to the actual construction of experimental nuclear reactors has been proposed, which consists of the development of reactor systems and components in non-nuclear engineering test facilities, zero-power critical experiments, and the testing of fuel elements and coolants in in-pile loops. This approach, although used successfully in the development of various solid-fuel coolant systems, is not completely applicable to circulating-fuel reactors because of the difficulty of simulating actual reactor operating conditions in such experiments. In in-pile loops, for example, the ratio of the volume of the piping system to the volume of the reacting zone is never quite the same as in a reactor, making it impossible to duplicate simultaneously the conditions of fuel concentration, enrichment, and power density.

A second aspect of circulating-fuel reactors, which precludes relying solely on engineering tests and in-pile loops, is the close interrelation of the nuclear behavior and the operational characteristics of the fuel circulation system, which can be determined only through construction and operation of a reactor. Other aspects of reactor design that can be best determined in an operating homogeneous reactor are continuous removal of fission products produced in the nuclear reaction and remote decontamination and maintenance of reactor equipment and piping.

7-1. 2 Sequence of experimental reactors. In this sequence, which started with non-power research reactors, seven such reactors have been built (not including duplicates of the water boilers). In the sections of this chapter which follow, these reactors are described in detail, and their design, construction, and operating characteristics are compared. Their construction covers the regime of homogeneous reactor technology involving the feasibility of relatively small reactors fueled with aqueous solutions of uranium.

Homogeneous reactors fueled with a solution of an enriched uranium salt were initiated at the Los Alamos Scientific Laboratory in 1943 through an attempt to find a chain-reacting system using a minimum of enriched fuel. The first of a sequence of such reactors, known as LOPO (for low power), went critical at Los Alamos in May 1954 with 565 grams of U5 as uranyl sulfate. The uranium, containing 14. 5% U-235, was dissolved in approximately 13 liters of ordinary water contained in a type-347 stainless steel sphere 1 ft in diameter and 1/32 in. in wall thickness.

Following successful low-power operation of the LOPO, the reactor was provided with a thicker sphere (1/16 in. ), integral cooling coils, and a shield to permit operation at 6 kW. Also, part of the beryllium oxide reflector was replaced by a graphite thermal column, and holes through the shield and reflector were provided for experiments.

The modifications were made in two phases. The first phase, begun in April 1949 and completed in February 1950, improved the experimental facilities and increased the neutron flux. The second phase, begun in October 1950 and completed in March 1951, increased the thermal neutron irradiation facilities, improved the reactor operation, and removed the explosive hazard in the exhaust gases.

The beryllium portion of the reflector was replaced by graphite. The all-graphite reflector gave a more rapid and complete shutdown of the reactor and eliminated the variable starting source produced by the (γ,n) reaction on beryllium. A 200-millicurie RaBe source placed in the reflector was used as a startup neutron source.

Two additional vertical control rods were added, which moved into the sphere in re-entrant thimbles. These consisted of about 120 grams of boron carbide, giving the additional control required by the change to an all-graphite reflector. Previously observed shadow effects were eliminated by the internal position of the rods and by the location of the control chambers under the reactor.

The reactor solution was changed from 15% U-235-enriched uranyl nitrate to one of 88. 7% enrichment. This made possible the continued use of a low uranium concentration in the solution with the poorer all-graphite reflector. The gas evolution produced by nitric acid decomposition was greatly reduced due to the lower total nitrogen content.

The entire inner reactor shield was improved to permit higher power operation with low neutron leakage and also to increase the neutron-to-gamma-ray intensity in the thermal columns. Cadmium was replaced by B4C paraffin, and additional steel shielding was added.

A recombination system was constructed to handle the off-gases from the reactor. The use of a closed circulating gas system with a catalyst chamber of platinized alumina removed any explosive hazard in the exhaust gases due to the presence of hydrogen and oxygen. The operating characteristics of the reactor were greatly improved by returning directly back to the reactor as water all but a very small fraction of the gases.

The production of hydrogen plus oxygen due to radiation decomposition amounts to approximately 20 liters/min during operation of the reactor at 45 kW. These gases leave the reactor core and pass through a reflux condenser, which removes much of the water vapor, and then through a stainless steel-wool trap for final moisture removal. A blower feeds the gas into one of two interchangeable catalyst chambers containing platinized alumina pellets. These chambers, operating at 370 to 470°C, recombine the hydrogen and oxygen, and the gas leaving the catalyst contains the water vapor formed. A second condenser reduces the temperature of the exit gas to that entering the catalyst chamber. A total of 100 liters/min of gas is circulated continuously in the closed gas system at pressures slightly above atmospheric, and the hydrogen concentration is kept below the detonation limit at all points of the system. Excess pressures produced in the gas system can be bled to the atmosphere through a 150-ft-high exhaust stack.

Kinetic experiments in water boilers: In August 1953, experiments were performed on the SUPO by a group of scientists from the Oak Ridge National Laboratory and Los Alamos to determine the degree to which a boiling (and non-boiling) homogeneous reactor automatically compensates for suddenly imposed supercritical conditions. Previous boiling experiments in 1951, unreported in the open literature, had indicated the stability of SUPO under steady-state boiling conditions.

However, there remained considerable doubt as to the adaptability of a reactor of this type to a sudden introduction of excess reactivity, such as might occur with a sudden increase in pressure above the reactor. The tests were performed by suddenly ejecting a neutron poison, consisting of an aluminum rod containing boron carbide at its tip, and simultaneously measuring the neutron flux level with high-speed recorders connected to a boron-coated ionization chamber located in the graphite reflector. The amount of reactivity introduced was determined by the position of a calibrated control rod. Although the experiments were interrupted by frequent accidental scrams caused by the unsuitability of SUPO for boiling at high solution levels in the sphere, the results indicated that in both boiling and non-boiling cases, the reactor power was self-regulating, but excursions were terminated more rapidly under boiling conditions. The average lifetime of prompt neutrons in the reactor was calculated from the initial prompt rise in the neutron flux and found to be about 1. 7 x 10^7 sec. Following a reactivity addition, the initial rate of reactivity decrease (0. 2 sec after start) was greater than about five times the rate that could be attributed to core-temperature rise and the associated negative temperature coefficient (0. 024% key, /°C).

As the gas bubbles left the core region, reactivity decreased due to core temperature rise increased in relative importance. The results of these experiments indicated that SUPO was capable of maintaining a stable power level even with sudden changes in excess reactivity, but further testing was necessary to determine the exact limits of this stability and the safety factors required for reactor design.

More recent experiments with the Kinetic Experiment for Water Boilers (KEWB-1), operated by Atomics International for the U. S. Atomic Energy Commission, have verified the self-controlling features of a solution-type reactor. It was found that automatic shutdown due to the temperature increase and formation of gas bubbles in the reactor fuel solution occurs under all abnormal operating conditions tested.

7-2. 3 The North Carolina State College research reactor. The simplicity of the Water Boiler reactor has made it of interest as a laboratory tool for experimental work with neutrons and gamma rays and also to was of this type. It was completed after four years of planning, design, the reactor building, and associated laboratory equipment. It differs from the Los Alamos SUPO in that the fuel container is a cylinder 11 in. in diameter and 11 in. high, rather than a sphere. Its experimental facilities include 12 access ports and a thermal column.

In June 1955, the reactor was shut down because of leaks that developed in the fuel container, permitting the radioactive fuel to contaminate the inside of the reactor shield. After a major repair job, operation of the reactor with a new core was resumed in March 1957 at a power level of 500 watts, and the reactor has operated successfully at that level for a year.

Atomics International solution-type research reactors. Several versions of the Water Boiler are being offered commercially by various companies. Higher power Water Boilers, operating at 50 kW, include the Kinetic Experiment for Tokai, Japan, and Farbwerke Hoechst A. G.

The first solution-type research reactor for industrial use went into operation in June 1956. The general features of this reactor, which Atomics International built for the Armour Research Foundation at the Illinois Institute of Technology, Chicago, Illinois, are shown in Figure 2.

The exposure facilities include one 6-in. -diameter beam tube extending radially to within 2 ft of the core tank and 4 in. in diameter from there to the core tank, two 4-in. and two 3-in. through-tubes passing tangentially to the core tank, one 1. 5-in. -diameter tube passing through the central region of the core, four 4-in. vertical tubes located in the reflector, one 5 ft X 5 ft graphite thermal column with a 12-in. -square removable section. The tube facilities consist of steel sleeves extending through the concrete shield and aluminum thimbles or liners which reach to the immediate vicinity of the core. Each tube facility is equipped with a graphite reflector plug and a dense concrete-and-steel shielding plug to be installed when the facility is not in use.

The horizontal thermal column is formed by a 5-ft-square column of graphite, in the center of which are nine removable graphite stringers. A large volume, which may be used for exposures, is provided between the end of the thermal column and the inner face of a movable concrete door. The thermal column access ports open into this volume.

To take advantage of the 50,000 curies of gamma activity produced by the fission-product gases circulating through the gas recombiner tank, exposure facilities are provided which extend from the subpile room into the exposure room and into the valve room. The facilities listed below consist of steel sleeves and aluminum thimbles which extend through the dense concrete walls of the exposure room.

2 gamma ports, 4-inch diameter; 2 gamma ports, 8-inch diameter; 1 rectangular gamma slot, 6 inches by 18 inches. In addition, two 4-inch diameter gamma ports extend from the subpile room into the valve room. As with the beam tubes, each port is equipped with a plug to be installed for shielding purposes when the port is not in use.

The purpose of this reactor was to investigate the nuclear and chemical characteristics of a circulating uranium solution reactor at temperatures and powers sufficiently high for the production of electricity from the thermal energy released. Specifically, it was designed to operate at heat and a maximum fuel-solution temperature of 482°F, yielding, after heat exchange, a saturated-steam pressure of about 200 psi.

During the 24-month period in which the reactor was in operation, starting in April 1952, liquid was circulated for a total of about 4500 hr. The reactor was critical for a total of 1950 hr and operated above 100 kW for 720 hr. The maximum power level attained was 1600 kW. The reactor was shut down in the spring of 1954 and dismantled to make room for the Homogeneous Reactor Test (HRE-2), having successfully demonstrated the nuclear stability of a circulating-fuel reactor. The characteristics of the HRE-1 are summarized in Table 7-2.

7-3. 2 The reactor fuel system: The reactor core consisted of a stainless steel sphere 18 in. in diameter, through which was circulated 100 to 120 gpm of 93% enriched uranyl sulfate dissolved in distilled water. 7-3. The flow rate was varied by changing the position of a valve located at the bottom of the core tank.

Rise of the solution passing through the core was about 72°F at a power level of 1000 kW. The liquid was discharged from the core at a temperature of 482°F and cooled to 410°F by evaporating water from the shell side of a U-tube heat exchanger, thus generating about 3000 lb/hr of 200 psi steam. A canned-rotor centrifugal pump returned the fuel to the core to be reheated. The total volume of the solution in the high-pressure system was about 90 liters, of which 50 liters were in the core. A schematic flow diagram of HRE-1 is shown in Figure 4.

A total pressure of 1000 psi was maintained in the fuel system by heating a small volume of fuel to 545°F in a pressurizer chamber directly above the sphere. The 1000 psi total pressure, which is over 400 psi greater than is required to prevent boiling of the fuel solution, was necessary to minimize the volume of decomposition gases.

Of heavy water surrounding the core vessel. The heavy water was pressurized with helium to within +100 psi of the fuel pressure in order to minimize stresses in the 3/16-in. wall of the spherical fuel container. Both the reflector and the concentric core were contained in an outer pressure vessel.

In order to limit thermal stresses and reduce corrosion of the steel vessel, the reflector temperature was regulated near 350°F. About 50 kW of heat conducted from the fuel core to the reflector liquid was removed by circulating the heavy water with a 30-gpm canned-rotor pump through a reflector cooler, which acted as a boiler feedwater preheater. A jet was located in this high-pressure circulating loop, the suction of which drew a continuous stream of gas from the vapor space above the reflector to a catalytic recombiner so that the concentration of deuterium and oxygen gases in this vapor space could be kept below explosive limits.

Some measure of nuclear control was obtained by changing the level of the reflector. The level could be lowered by draining liquid through a valve to storage tanks, or raised by starting a feed pump. This pump, which employed a hydraulically driven diaphragm with check valves, had a capacity of approximately 2 gpm against 1000 psi. Its intake was connected to supply tanks at atmospheric pressure located below the reactor. These tanks also served as degas chambers for the reflector liquid, which was discharged from the pressure vessel.

Gas liberated here passed upward through a condenser to a small low-pressure catalytic bed where the O2 and D2 gases were recombined to form D2O. Cold traps operated at -20°F were included in the reflector system vent lines to prevent the loss of D2O or its contamination with H2O vapor.

7-3. 4 The fuel off-gas system. When the reactor was operating, without copper sulfate in the fuel solution, the fuel solvent (H2O) was decomposed by the energy of fission to yield a stoichiometric mixture of hydrogen and oxygen gas at a rate of 0. 28 cfm (10 cfm at STP). In addition to this large volume of decomposition gases, there was also produced a very small volume (20 cc/day) of intensely radioactive fission gas. If these gases had not been removed and replaced by more liquid, excessive pressures would soon result, and since virtually all of this gas was liberated within the core, the displacement of fuel solution by the gas would make it impossible for the chain reaction to continue. For this reason, the gas was continuously separated from the fuel in the core by injecting the main circulating stream tangentially near the equator of the sphere, which caused the fluid to rotate and form a vertical cylindrical vortex approximately 1/4 in. in diameter. The centrifugal action of the rotating fluid served to separate the decomposition and fission gases from the liquid to the vortex, the axis of which was aligned with the fuel outlet. A nozzle with a central opening in the fluid outlet allowed the removal of gas from the vortex. The cooled mixture of gas and liquid was then throttled through a valve into a gas separator which was connected to the fuel-solution storage tanks.

This gas, plus about 0. 8 gpm of the fuel solution, was passed through the outer annulus of a countercurrent, concentric-tube heat exchanger, which was partially cooled by 0. 8 gpm flow of fresh makeup liquid being pumped back to the core. The gas-steam mixture rose from the gas separator to a condenser immediately preceding a flame recombiner so that the gases leaving the condenser were combustible and reunited to water in the flame of the recombiner shown in -4.

The flame recombiner is best described as an oversized Bunsen or Meeker burner enclosed in a water-jacketed cylinder. In the HRE-1, no attempt was made to use this 40 kW of high-temperature heat, although in larger scale reactors, this energy might be used to superheat steam by about 70°F.

The exit gases from the flame recombiner contained only fission products and small amounts of unrecombined hydrogen and oxygen. They were passed through a catalytic recombiner, which contained a platinized alumina catalyst, to eliminate the traces of hydrogen and oxygen. The catalytic bed was followed by a condenser and cold traps to prevent the loss of water from the system.

At this point, it was composed mainly of excess oxygen plus the highly active fission gases, mainly xenon, krypton, and their decay products. The activity of these gases was many orders of magnitude greater than the activity which can be discharged directly to the atmosphere without the construction of a very expensive stack; therefore, it was desirable to provide some inexpensive means of storage for the dissipation of the radioactivity. This was accomplished by passing the gases through cold traps to remove moisture and adsorbing them onto water-cooled activated carbon beds, which were buried underground outside the reactor building.

The adsorption efficiency of the charcoal, even at ground temperature, was good enough to prevent a discharge of activity greater than a few curies per day. However, even this amount of activity had to be diluted so that the atmospheric concentration at ground level was not greater than 10-7 curies/cc of air. Dilution was accomplished by feeding the active gas into a 1000-cfm ventilating air stream from the reactor shield and then to a 100-ft-high stack. During operation, the gaseous activity inside the stack barely exceeded inhalation tolerance.

7-3. 5 Fuel concentration control. The condensate, which was removed from the vapor-gas mixture upstream of the recombiner, was returned either to the fuel storage tanks or to weighed holding tanks. The accumulation of water in the holding tanks provided a means of increasing the concentration of fuel in the storage tanks underneath the reactor. Since fuel was pumped continuously from the storage tanks to the high-pressure system by means of a duplex-diaphragm type pump at a rate of 0. Figure 7-5 shows how the core temperature varied with fuel concentration, in g/kg H2O. Furthermore, since the operating temperature of the core was controlled by the fuel concentration as shown in this figure, the operator had a convenient means of adjusting the solution temperature to the desired level. This feature of variable concentration was employed during startup of the reactor when the concentration had to be changed by large amounts, and also during steady operation for small changes in temperature.

7-3. 6 Power removal. The steam generated in the fuel heat exchanger was fed to a conventional multistage condensing turbine generator rated at 312 kVA. With the reactor operating at 1000 kW and 250°C, a sufficient quantity of steam at 200 psi was produced to generate about 140 kW of electricity. Small feed pumps returned the condensate from the turbine to the boiler.

7~3. 7 Internal-recombination experiments. The use of copper dissolved in the reactor fuel for the complete recombination of radiolytic gas was successfully demonstrated in the HRE-1 in a static system at 250°C, at 1000 psig total pressure, and at a uniform power density of 20 kW/liter. The investigation was conducted at temperatures from 185 to 260°C, at pressures from 765 to 1200 psig, and at power levels as high as 1600 kW. In the main, the copper behaved as expected from static bomb tests. The highest power level for which all the gas was internally recombined was 1350 kW. In the course of all copper experiments, including 350 hr of operation at the highest copper concentration, 0. 062 molar, no deleterious effects due to the presence of copper were observed.

7-3. 8 Nuclear safety. Although operating experience later verified early predictions of the inherent safety of this reactor, at the time of design, it was considered judicious to incorporate conventional safety devices in the reactor for protection against potentially dangerous situations that might arise during low-power operation and until the dynamic stability had been demonstrated by experiment. Safety measures in the order of their automatic action as installed to limit reactor power or power doubling time are as follows: 1. Thermal fuses, which would interrupt coolant flow through the core if the temperature rose above a predetermined level. 2. Boron-salt control rods, which could be inserted into the core to absorb neutrons and shut down the reactor. 3.

Experiments demonstrated that the reactor was extremely fast-acting with respect to limiting power surges and led to the belief that mechanical control devices were unnecessary. These consisted of a series of kinetic experiments in which the power responses to reactivity increases were observed.

Second, then, to provide more drastic tests, the main fuel circulating pump was stopped, and the reactor was maintained at a low power and high temperature, but the heat exchanger was cooled by about 100°C. 8% kg per second. In one experiment, the power increased in a period as short as 35 msec, reaching a peak of 10 MW in 1 sec, and then approached the equilibrium power demand within 0. 2 sec after the peak. The calculated pressure rise associated with the peak power of 10 MW was only 5 psi.

In these experiments, the worst combination of circumstances was imposed on the reactor. It was successfully demonstrated that the HRE-1 was sufficiently stable to withstand nuclear transients greater than those expected from operating errors.

And each joint contained a leak detection device for constant monitoring. In addition, the ventilating air, which flowed through each equipment compartment, was monitored constantly with gamma radiation detection devices. Although several leaks were experienced in the startup phases, no leakage was found during the final 12-month period.

7-3. 10 Shielding. As with all nuclear reactors, personnel had to be protected from the high radiation levels which existed in the vicinity of the reactor core. In the HRE-1, this protection was provided by a 7-ft thick shielding wall of high-density concrete. An increase in the density of the concrete from 2. 3 to 3.5 g/cc resulted from the use of barium sulfate ore as the aggregate material. The shield was a departure from most reactor shields in that it was constructed of loosely stacked blocks with only the outer 16-in. layer of blocks being mortared.

Maintenance. The maintenance of homogeneous reactors is greatly complicated by the radioactivity of the parts, and in the HRE-1, it was often necessary to decontaminate equipment and to provide temporary protective shielding before repair work could be done. In most cases, the repair work had to be done with long-handled tools, which made the job even more difficult. By the use of decontamination, shielding, and extension tools, it was possible, however, to make a number of major repairs in the HRE-1 during its operating life.

Repairs in radiation fields as high as 2000 r/hr, without exposing personnel beyond accepted tolerances, are possible. In this regard, remote viewing devices such as mirrors, binoculars, and a Polaroid Land camera were found to be invaluable tools. The main circulating pump was replaced or repaired three times under such conditions, and the diaphragm feed pumps twice. In fact, in no case of a breakdown was it impossible to make the necessary repairs.

7-3. 13 Dismantling the HRE-1. After the final shutdown of the HRE-1, the reactor was decontaminated in preparation for disassembly. Over a period of 30 days, starting with activity levels of the order of 1000 r/hr, the activity was reduced sufficiently to permit dismantling of the system with long-handled tools.

The decontamination treatment consisted of repeated washing alternately with 35% HNO3 and aqueous solutions of 10% sodium hydroxide. Decontamination with a single reagent was only between 1 and 2. 25. Large amounts (of the order of 10% curies) of cerium, zirconium, barium, lanthanum, strontium, niobium, and ruthenium were removed. The significant contaminants remaining were zirconium and niobium, which were bound in the oxide film. Although these could have been removed from the system by descaling the oxide corrosion film, which would have given a further decontamination factor of approximately 100, such a treatment would have made it impossible to determine that no significant corrosion had taken place during nuclear operation.

Asked to suggest ways in which the design and construction of the reactor and the associated development program might have been improved. More than one hundred specific design changes were recommended, many of which related to the difficulty of operating the reactor on a continuous basis and the need for repairing and/or replacing faulty equipment. Among the many possible improvements recommended were the use of high-pressure catalytic recombination external gas separation (Le. , nonvortex core flow) spacing of equipment for easier inspection and maintenance shielded, waterproof instrument lines instrumentation for more accurate fuel accountability improved feed pumps and provision for obtaining meaningful corrosion data.

The general conclusion reached was that the reactor construction schedule (16 months) was too accelerated to allow good design and construction practices to be put fully into effect. The component development and testing program, in particular, suffered because of the short time schedule.

The thorough analysis of the HRE-1 design provided a basis for the subsequent design of the HRE-2, in which many of the suggested improvements were incorporated. These included: (a) greater accessibility of equipment; (b) provision for flooding cells; (c) better shield construction with metal walls to permit decontamination; (d) more accurate means for measuring fuel inventories; and (e) elimination of screw-type fittings.

7-3. 15 Summary of results. As a result of the operation of the HRE-1 and of the extensive experimental program conducted with it, several uncertainties were resolved regarding the nuclear and chemical behavior of aqueous homogeneous reactors at the high temperatures and high pressures required for power generation. Included were demonstrations of (1) a remarkable degree of inherent nuclear stability, a result of the very large negative temperature coefficient of reactivity; (2) the elimination of the need for mechanical control rods as a consequence of this inherent stability; (3) flexibility and simplicity of fuel handling; (4) stability of the fuel; (5) the ability to attain and maintain leaktightness in a small high-pressure reactor system; (6) the safe handling of the hydrogen and oxygen produced by radiation decomposition of the water; and (7) the direct dependence of reactor power upon turbine demand.

7-4. 1 Objectives. The objectives of the Homogeneous Reactor Test (HRE-2) are: (1) to demonstrate that a homogeneous reactor of moderate size can be operated with the continuity required of a power plant; (2) to establish the reliability of engineering materials and components of a size which can be adapted to full-scale power plants; (3) to evaluate equipment modifications which will lead to simplifications and economy; (4) to test simplified maintenance procedures and, in particular, underwater maintenance; and (5) to develop and test methods for the continuous removal of fission and corrosion contaminants.

With the HRE-1, in order to satisfy the objective of a significant test of the engineering feasibility of a large power station, it was necessary to increase the physical size of the reactor and its auxiliaries appreciably beyond that of HRE-1. To hold costs within reasonable bounds for an experiment, it was decided to limit the power output and thus the expense for heat-removal equipment, and also to install the reactor in the building which had previously housed HRE-1, permitting the use of many of the existing site facilities. The power output was set at 5000 kW (heat) with the possibility of a maximum 10,000 kW, and the core diameter at 32 inches. Although these together result in a low specific power of 17 kW/liter in the core at 5000 kW, this was considered acceptable since operability at a relatively high specific power of 30 kW/liter had been demonstrated in HRE-1. Another factor affecting the selection of core diameter was the opinion of fabricators that current technology would be exceeded for a zirconium vessel larger than 32 inches.

The increase in fuel temperature from 250°C in the HRE-1 to 300°C was based upon the more favorable corrosion resistance of both stainless steel and Zircaloy-2 to dilute uranyl sulfate at the higher temperature and the possibility of improved thermal efficiencies. Also, the temperature at which the two-liquid phase region appears is higher for the more dilute fuel, permitting this increase.

The design pressure of 2000 psi resulted from the necessity for an overpressure on the system to prevent boiling, to reduce the volume of gas in the core, and to increase the efficiency of the copper catalyst. A maximum pressure of 750 psi was thus provided in excess of the vapor pressure of water of about 1250 psi at 300°C.

The thickness of the blanket of 14 inches between the core and pressure vessel was selected as a compromise between neutron leakage and the use of a simple pressure vessel of dimensions within the means of standard manufacturing capabilities.

The vortex-type flow through the core of HRE-1 was abandoned in favor of straight-through flow because hydrodynamic experiments demonstrated the pressure drop of the former to be excessive for larger cores. As a result, the extraction of radiolytic gas directly from the core was excluded, and an external gas separator in the exit pipe from the core was used to separate gases produced in the core. The amount of these gases depends on the operating temperature and pressure and the CuSO4 concentration. The excess gases are recombined at low pressure but by means of a platinized alumina catalyst instead of combustion in a flame-type recombiner as in the HRE-1.

In stagnant fuel lines external to the core, the radiolytically generated oxygen is insufficient to replace the oxygen consumed in reacting with the stainless steel to form metallic oxides. Since an oxygen deficiency induces hydrolytic precipitation of the uranium, approximately 2 liters/min (STP) of gaseous oxygen are injected into the fuel feed stream, maintaining a concentration of approximately 500 ppm in the high-pressure system. The disposal of the fission-product gases, which are stripped from the fuel by the excess oxygen and radiolytic gas, is accomplished by adsorption and subsequent decay on beds of activated carbon. Experience with this method of disposal was completely satisfactory in the HRE-1.

To reduce the xenon content of the core solution and minimize the catalyst-poisoning effect of fission-product iodine on the recombiners, an iodine-absorption bed of silver-coated wire mesh was installed in the offgas line between the fuel dump tank and the recombiners. The bed removes over 99% of the iodine passing through it and will retain the absorbed iodine at temperatures up to 450°C.

Type 347 stainless steel was designated as the material of construction for all of the reactor except the Zircaloy-2 core vessel. Titanium was chosen to reinforce certain points of high turbulence, such as the pump impellers and the gas separator. Previous corrosion and welding experience with this grade of stainless steel, also used for HRE-1, has been excellent.

Based on HRE-1 experience, it was decided to eliminate mechanical control devices and rely entirely on varying the fuel concentration for shim control, on temperature coefficient for transient nuclear changes, and on dumping the fuel solution for rapid shutdown when required.

In the high-pressure system, the fuel solution is pumped into the bottom of the reactor core at 256°C and is heated to 300°C as it proceeds upward to the outlet pipe. At the top of the outlet pipe is attached the pressurizer, in which condensate is electrically heated to a maximum temperature of 335°C to produce 2000-psi steam. The fuel flows past the pressurizer to the gas separator, where directional vanes cause the fluid to rotate sufficiently to separate the radiolytic gas (D2 and O2), the excess O2, and fission product gas. The separated gas forms a vortex along the axis of the pipe and is bled to the low-pressure system. The reactor solution continues from the gas separator to the U-tube primary heat exchanger, where it is cooled from 300°C to 256°C by transferring heat to the boiler feedwater surrounding the tube bundle. The 244°C, 520-psi steam produced on the shell side of the heat exchanger is bled partially to the small (345-kVA output) turbine generator remaining from the HRE-1 and partially to an air-cooled steam condenser. The uranyl sulfate solution flows next to the intake of the 400-gpm canned-motor circulating pump and thence is pumped to the core for reheating. The blanket fluid follows an identical cycle at a flow rate of 230 gpm.

The gases and some entrained liquid removed by the gas separator are transferred to the low-pressure system through a "letdown heat exchanger," a jacketed pipe which cools the gas-liquid mixture to 90°C. A valve downstream of the heat exchanger throttles the gas-liquid stream to atmospheric pressure. The mixture then discharges into the "dump tanks," which have sufficient capacity to hold all the reactor liquid. An evaporator built into the dump tanks provides continuous mixing and, more importantly, steam for the dilution of the deuterium and oxygen below the explosive limits. The gas-and-steam mixture flows upward through the iodine bed to the catalytic recombiner, in which the deuterium and oxygen react on a bed of platinized alumina pellets to form water vapor. The heavy water is condensed by the shell-and-tube condenser following the recombiner and normally flows back to the dump tanks. However, the water may be diverted to weighed storage tanks in case it is desired to change the concentration of the fuel solution. Water which is returned to the dump tanks is mixed with the excess fuel solution stored there (approximately 25 gal) and then fed to the intake of a sealed-diaphragm injection pump, which returns the liquid to the high-pressure circulating system at a rate of about 1 gpm, thus constantly replacing the liquid removed via the gas separator.

Oxygen remaining after condensation of the re-formed heavy water is dried in cold traps at -23°C and sent to the beds of activated carbon for a period of decay. Gas leaving the bed is diluted with 1400 cfm of air and discharged to the atmosphere from a 100-ft stack.

Samplers are provided to secure small quantities (5 ml) of the fuel and blanket liquids from the high- and low-pressure systems for chemical analysis. These units are located in bypass lines; material circulated through them is trapped by closing the sampler inlet and exit. After that, the contents are discharged into a portable container through a drain valve.

All the primary reactor equipment is located in an underground, box-like, steel tank called the “shield pit,” shown in Figure 8. The design of the shield pit was influenced by several factors, including a requirement for accessibility and flexibility because of the experimental nature of the installation, provision for complete containment of the contents of the reactor should a leak develop or should the pressure vessel or heat exchangers rupture, efficient utilization of the space within an existing structure, and capability of flooding with water for maintenance or replacement operations.

The reactor shield pit occupies the center high-bay area of the building and is constructed of 3/4-inch welded steel plate reinforced in such a manner that an internal pressure of 30 psi will be contained. This pressure corresponds to the instantaneous adiabatic release of the entire contents of the reactor system. The chemical processing cells, each 12 ft wide by 25 ft long, are designed similarly.

The upper surface of the blocks forming the roof of the shield pit is at ground level. This roof is made of high-density concrete, 5 feet in total thickness, and consists of two layers of removable slabs with a completely welded steel sheet sandwiched between the layers and extending across the top of the pit to form a gastight lid. The roof blocks are anchored to the girders and supporting columns by means of a slot-and-key arrangement, as shown in Fig. 8. The vertical columns are embedded in a concrete pad which is 3 feet thick and heavily reinforced with steel.

The wall between the reactor pit and the control area is a hollow box 54 ft wide, constructed of 1/2-inch steel plate welded to the north side of the reactor shield tank. It is filled with high-density barytes, sand, and water. All lines leaving the reactor tank are welded into the shield wall; conduits are connected into junction boxes inside the pit with gastight seals on the individual wires.

The design is such that nowhere outside the shield will the radiation dosage exceed 10 mrem/hr when the reactor is at 10 MW. For the purpose of decreasing the neutron activation of equipment inside the pit, the reactor has been designed with a moderator-to-fuel volume ratio of 2. 5 to 1 and a fuel-to-moderator volume ratio of 3. 7 to 1.

The arrangement of reactor components within the main reactor pit is shown in Figure 9. The reactor is near the center of the pit, enclosed by the 2-ft-thick thermal shield. To the left of the reactor is all the fuel system equipment, and to the right is the blanket equipment.

Most of the high-pressure components are located close to the pressure vessel. The pressurizers are positioned directly above the reactor, while gas separators are in the S-shaped outlet lines to the steam generators on the south side of the pit. The areas to the left and right of the reactor in the center bay are reserved for future equipment modifications or additions.

To the far left is grouped all of the fuel low-pressure equipment, including dump tanks, recombiner, condensate tank, and cold traps; these components are assembled on a rigid structural-steel frame.

Insofar as possible, valves are situated close to the control room wall so that air lines and leak detector lines can be kept short. The arrangement of the valves is such that all flanges can be easily disconnected from each other without disturbing any piping or equipment.

7-4. 3 Schedule of construction. Construction of the HRE-2 was started in July 1954, immediately after the dismantling of HRE-1. The initial step was the excavation of a large hole beneath the building (which had previously housed the HRE-1) for the large rectangular steel tank (60 ft long, 303 ft wide, and 25 ft deep) which contains the reactor and its associated equipment. Figure 7-10 shows this tank at approximately 7-4.

The north wall of the reactor tank, seen to the left in -10, is common to both the reactor tank and the control-room area, and it is through this wall that the many service, instrument, and electrical lines which must interconnect these two areas pass. The next step in the construction was to install the approximately 600 lines which penetrate this 53-ft-thick wall.

Figure 7-11 shows the tank after the complete roof structure had been assembled and welded closed as it was prepared for a hydrostatic test. In this test, the tank was filled with water and then pressurized to give the equivalent of a 30-lb internal pressure at all points within the tank. Strain gauges were attached at many points so that the complicated stress pattern could be studied in some detail for assurance that the tank was safely within design limits.

While the reactor tank and control-room areas were being constructed, reactor equipment was being procured and constructed at several places. Much of the equipment required in the low-pressure system had been inspected and tested when the container was completed.

The heat exchangers were subsequently installed, followed by the main circulating pumps so that the high-pressure piping which connected the pumps, heat exchangers, and pressure vessel could be attached. This work occupied most of the months of February and March. Construction of the reactor was completed in May 1956. Figure 7-13 is an artist's concept of the completed reactor.

7-4. 4 Non-nuclear testing and operation. Pretesting, operation of the reactor as a non-nuclear facility, and a lengthy flange-replacement job occupied the period from completion of construction in May 1956 to December 1957.

From Table 7-6, it can be noted that preoperational testing of HRE-2 was interrupted by stress-corrosion cracking difficulties, which were caused by chloride ion contamination in the stainless steel tubes that are used to detect and prevent leakage of radioactive solution from flanged joints. Figure 7-14 shows how an individual leak-detector line is attached to the groove of the ring-joint flange. The tubes from all the flanges terminate at a valve header station in the control room. Normally, this system is kept pressurized with water to a pressure of 300 to 500 psi above the system pressure. A leak in any flange results in leakage of water from the header and a loss in pressure, which actuates an alarm at a fixed level above the fuel or blanket pressure.

June 1956 - Cleaning of piping systems with 3% trisodium phosphate, followed by 5% nitric acid, and initial operation of pumps. Tests for dump-tank entrainment and efficiency of catalytic recombiner.

Of preventing the leakage of radioactive liquid from the reactor (the leak detector fluid leaks out instead) and detecting the leaks when they do occur (by measuring the pressure or volume loss of the leak-detector fluid). Volume changes in the header can be read to +1 cc from a graduated scale next to each header sight glass.

Since this system is a secondary portion of the reactor, the leak-detector tubing, unfortunately, did not receive the same attention from the standpoint of specification and materials control as the stainless steel used in the primary piping. The 1/4-in. type-304 stainless steel had been purchased to standard ASTM tubing specifications, but in 30- to 40-ft lengths instead of the usual 20-ft lengths. The tubing was received and installed without difficulty. It was given a hydrostatic test after installation and put in service with distilled water. After approximately three months, it was observed that some of the water drained from the leak-detector system was badly discolored. An analysis revealed the liquid to contain approximately 1000 ppm of chloride.

After discussions with the tubing manufacturer, it was concluded that the chloride had originated from a die-drawing compound, which had not been removed from the inside of the tubes prior to annealing. The presence of the chloride-containing hydrocarbon caused carbide precipitation at the grain boundaries during annealing and created tiny caves into which the chloride penetrated. The pickling and cleaning treatment which followed did not remove this material. In fact, it was learned that the manufacturer's pickling tanks did not accommodate the full length of the tubing, making it necessary to pickle by dipping approximately half the tubing at a time. The net result was that large quantities of chloride remained inside the tubing to be leached out later when filled with water.

At the time the stress-cracking damage was discovered late in 1956, the reactor had been made ready for a series of engineering tests, and for this reason, it was decided to make a brief inspection of the damage resulting from the chloride contamination before proceeding with the planned experimentation. This preliminary inspection provided the basis for a decision to prepare for the replacement of the 259 flanges and the 15,000 ft of leak-detector tubing in the system.

Of the 259 flanges inspected, 167 were found to be acceptable (i. e. , as good as new); 67 were rejected because of cracks, pits, or other possible flaws, and 25 were judged questionable. Nearly all of the rejected flanges were in high-temperature portions of the reactor. While the inspection method was selected as the best available, it was not judged to be infallible, e. g. , differentiation between mechanical scoring and corrosion pitting was not always clear-cut, and any cracks covered by smeared metal resulting from excessive gasket pressure could not be detected. Hence, it was decided to replace all the high-temperature flanges with new flanges or, where a total of 132 flanges were replaced, 15 were remachined. In addition, the 1/4-in. stainless steel tubing to all the high-pressure flanges (approximately 10,000 ft) was replaced in the leak-detector system. This repair work was completed in August 1957.

To remove any organic material introduced during repairs and to pretreat the fresh metal surfaces incorporated into the system, the reactor piping was subsequently flushed with hot 3% trisodium phosphate solution; followed by water rinses and a 5% nitric acid wash. After hydrostatic testing, the reactor was test-operated with condensate for 150 hr at 280°C, then charged with depleted uranyl sulfate solution. Test operation with depleted uranium included: (1) a series of concentration and dilution experiments to study the transient and equilibrium behavior of ions in the system; (2) checking of the inventory-control methods by comparing the fuel analyses and indicated system controls with the quantity originally charged; and (3) observation of the corrosion behavior by analysis of fuel samples during a 159-hr run at temperatures above 250°C. At the conclusion of the run, the charge was recovered and found to agree well with the computed inventory, although chemical analyses of high-pressure system samples during operation had indicated a uranium concentration 5 to 10% lower than the amount added would predict. Nickel analyses of the fuel solution pointed to a system corrosion rate of slightly less than 1/2 mpy.

Before the reactor was charged with enriched fuel, the piping and shield were subjected to careful leak tests. To obviate the presence of helium in the piping in case further testing with helium became necessary, the reactor was first pressurized to 500 psig with nitrogen, to which was added 40 curies of Kr-5 as a tracer gas.

The presence of any leaking krypton. This test was inconclusive at the time; however, because of difficulties encountered in purifying the samples for counting. Large samples of the air being tested were stored in gas cylinders; then the piping was vented and repressurized with helium. After an additional waiting period, the sealed volumes were again checked using helium leak detectors sensitive to 1 ppm of helium in air. This test demonstrated that the piping leakage was less than 0. 2 cc/day of helium, with a pressure differential of 15 psi across the leak. These results were subsequently confirmed by krypton data after analytical difficulties were resolved.

With the integrity of the reactor piping established, the seal pans were welded in place on the shield roof, and the roof plugs were locked in place. By pressurizing the shield and flooding the roof with water, leaks in the seal pan welds were located for subsequent repair. The major shield leak was found to be through a 16-in. valve in the ventilating duct. When this was repaired, the total leakage fell from 25 cfm to approximately 0. 5 cfm. The shield was judged sufficiently tight at this point to proceed with the critical experiments, after which repairs were continued. By painstaking individual checking of all shield penetrations and the use of thermosetting resin to seal the metal lips to which the roof seal pans are welded, the leakage was finally reduced to 4 to 4. 5 liters/min at 15 psig.

7-4. 5 Nuclear operation. Fuel charging began on December 24, and criticality was achieved on December 27, 1957, with the core and blanket near room temperature and at a pressure of about 800 psig. Nuclear instrumentation for the test consisted of three fission chambers, viz. , two permanent chambers in the instrument tube outside the reactor pressure vessel and a temporary chamber inside the blanket vessel. An antimony-beryllium neutron source was suspended in the thimble in the center of the core (see -18).

The reactor was brought gradually to the critical condition by the injection of enriched uranium into the fuel solution added to the dump tanks in batches of 100 to 400 g. Fuel feed pumps and purge pumps were operated continuously to provide mixing between the dump tanks and the high-pressure system. After 2060 g of U5 had been added and the temperature of the solution lowered to 29°C, the neutron source was withdrawn. At this point, the fission count rates continued to rise, indicating that criticality had been achieved. By further varying the temperature and concentration of the fuel solution, it was demonstrated that the nuclear reaction could be easily and safely controlled in this manner.

After the initial critical experiment, the neutron source was moved from the core to the blanket thimble, and the reactor was brought to criticality seven times at successively higher temperatures ranging up to 281°C. In each experiment, the reactor temperature was raised above the desired point by supplying steam to the heat exchangers, and a batch of fuel solution was injected into the dump tanks. After steady count rates showed complete mixing of the new fuel, the temperature was slowly lowered until the critical temperature was reached. It was held at this point for about 1/2 hr before proceeding to the next experiment. Figure 7-15 compares the experimental measurements of the HRE-2 critical concentration as a function of temperature with concentrations calculated by various methods. It can be seen that the two-group calculations predicted values about 20% below those observed. The harmonics calculation, which used a convolution of an age and a Yukawa kernel to represent slowing down in D2O, gave quite satisfactory results. The multigroup calculation also gave results in agreement with the experimental data.

The first operation of the reactor at significant power levels took place in February 1958. In April 1958, the power level was raised in steps of 1 MW to the design power level of 5 MW. Operation was exceptionally smooth, and no mechanical difficulties were encountered in the first 500 hours after charging the reactor with U-5. Unfortunately, shortly after reaching full-power operation, a crack developed in the tapered portion of the zirconium core tank, permitting fuel solution to leak into the blanket. After a series of tests to determine the magnitude of the leakage and calculations to determine the behavior of the reactor with fuel in the blanket, it was decided to operate the reactor as a one-region machine (i. e. , identical fuel solution in core and blanket).

As the size of homogeneous reactors increases, the use of control-rod neutron absorption to perform a startup becomes progressively less attractive. For example, to maintain criticality in HRE-2 while heating from 20 to 280°C requires a reactivity increase of more than 25% Ak because of the large negative temperature coefficient. It is much more convenient to provide a means of varying the amount of fuel in the core as required to overcome temperature and power coefficients.

During the initial experimental stage of HRE-2 operation, startup was begun by evaporating heavy water from the dump-tank solutions, condensing, and pumping to the core and blanket circulating loops. The filled loops were then pressurized; circulation was initiated by starting the canned-motor pumps, and the circulating stream was preheated to operating temperature with an auxiliary heat source. The concentrated fuel was then pumped from the dump tanks to achieve criticality.

An alternate procedure involves starting the reactor without preheating by varying the fuel concentration. When sufficient fuel has been added to raise the reactor temperature to its normal operating level, power withdrawal is begun. Temperature adjustments may be made by removing pure solvent to temporary storage tanks or adding pure solvent to the circulating fuel solution.

The time required for startup is determined by the rate at which heating can be permitted. The same limitations apply to homogeneous reactors as to other reactors in this respect. Generally, a heating rate of 100°F/hr is considered reasonable and unlikely to produce excessive stresses. Probably more important, but more difficult to determine, is the temperature difference which exists across heavy walls. Once the temperature limitations are established, the startup rate of fuel addition can be set to match them.

To prevent excessive power surges and the resultant excessive pressures or heating rates, restrictions are typically implemented in the form of electrical interlocks in the control circuit. For instance, a common interlock could prevent the operator from concentrating fuel if instruments indicated an excessive concentration, or it could halt the addition of fuel solution if temperature-measuring devices indicated too high a heating rate. While none of these errors are severe enough to trigger a reactor accident, they do signify inadequate operating technique. If unchecked, they could lead to more serious mistakes that might cause damage despite the inherent stability of an aqueous homogeneous system.

Operation. Except for several preliminary preparations, such as warming up the steam turbine, power extraction is the simplest part of the reactor startup routine. This involves merely turning steam to the turbine, bringing the turbine up to speed, and making the necessary electrical switching changes to distribute the electrical output. Once the generator is synchronized and feeding into a larger power network, there is little for the operator to do except to see that the equipment is checked routinely for proper performance. For HRE-2, this normally takes a crew which consists of a supervisor, an assistant engineer, and non-technical helpers. From time to time, samples of fuel solution are removed from the high-pressure circulating system to analyze for nickel and other unwanted ions. Samples must also be removed from the steam system to show that boiler feedwater treatment is adequate and that oxygen production is not excessive in the steam generators. Radiation levels must be observed to determine whether there are leaks of fuel solution or weak places in the shield structure.

In addition to these routine service functions, the operating crew must also start up and maintain the chemical processing plant associated with the reactor. One engineer and one technician, in addition to those already mentioned for the reactor proper, are required to operate the HRE-2.

The first step in the procedure is cessation of power removal, which involves nothing more than closing the steam throttling valve. This might be accomplished by running the turbine governor down to zero load. Although this action leaves the reactor critical at 280°C and does not completely stop heat generation, the power is limited to the normal heat losses from the system (a few hundred kilowatts for HRE-2).

The second step is to make the reactor subcritical by diluting the fuel.

Scram. A more rapid shutdown, equivalent to an emergency scram in a solid-fuel system, is the “dump. ” In this situation, the reactor is kept circulating for 2 min to permit recombination of the radiolytic gas in solution during which time the steam valves are closed to reduce power output. Then the pressure in excess of the vapor pressure of the core and blanket is vented to make pressure balancing between the core and blanket easier, and the dump valves are opened, permitting the rapid emptying of the core and blanket vessels so that the reactor is shut down within minutes.

Decontamination of equipment: Conventional methods of decontaminating fuel processing plants have proved to be inadequate for a stainless steel homogeneous reactor system, which has been exposed to uranyl sulfate-sulfuric acid-fission product solutions at 250 to 300°C. This was demonstrated with HRE-1, which was decontaminated (without descaling) prior to disassembly (Article 7-3. 13). Since the HRE decontamination was incomplete, laboratory studies were carried out to explore the nature of the contamination and develop methods of decontaminating the stainless steel. It was found that chromous sulfate, a strong reducing agent, would modify the oxide film and permit dissolution in dilute acids. A 0. 4m CrSO4-0. 5 m H2SO4 solution has given excellent removal of the film by modifying and dissolving the oxide corrosion film. Decontamination factors of 5 X 103 were achieved on specimens from in-pile corrosion loops, where the activity was reduced to the induced activity of the structural material by contacting for 4 hr with the chromous sulfate solution at 85°C.

The solution was also tested satisfactorily on four 22-liter uranyl sulfate. They had a very heavy oxide coating, such that in thermal cycles, large flakes broke off the wall and plugged small lines. After a 4-hr contact with the chromous sulfate-sulfuric acid solution at 85°C, the walls of the loop were completely free of all clinging oxide.

7-4. 7 The HRE-2 Mockup. During the design and construction of HRE-2, some of its major pieces of equipment were assembled and operated at design conditions on unenriched uranyl sulfate solution. The purposes of this engineering mockup were: (1) to study the behavior and removal of gases in the high-pressure system, (2) to study fuel-solution stability in a circulating system similar to the HRE-2, (3) to establish a reference corrosion rate for the reactor circulating system, (4) to study the behavior and removal of corrosion- and fission-product solids in the system, and (5) to establish the reliability of components, pointing out weaknesses and possible improvements.

The prototype reactor components tested in the mockup include: (1) a Westinghouse canned-rotor centrifugal pump; (2) an electrically heated steam pressurizer; (3) a centrifugal gas separator; (4) a 1/8-scale heat exchanger similar to the HRE-2 steam generator; (5) a letdown heat exchanger to cool the fluid and gas bled from the high-pressure system; (6) a bellows-sealed letdown valve to throttle the fluid and gas from the high-pressure system; (7) a liquid-level controller that adjusts the letdown-valve position; (8) the dump-tank and condensate system for excess fuel solution and storage of condensate for use as purge to the pressurizer and circulating pump; (9) diaphragm feed pumps to return fuel to the high-pressure system from the dump tanks; (10) an oxygen-feed system to maintain oxidizing conditions in the circulating fuel; and (11) an air-injection system for tests of the effectiveness of the gas-separator unit and letdown system.

In May 1956, a corrosion- and fission-product solids-removal system was installed in the mockup, consisting of a 5-gpm canned-rotor ORNL pump, an assembly of a hydroclone and underflow pot, and two 1/2-in. Fulton Sylphon bellows-sealed air-operated valves separating the system from the main circulating stream. A commercial pulsafeeder was used to inject rare earths containing radioactive tracers and corrosion products. In addition, a through-flow bomb was filled with the required solids and connected into the system. A multichannel gamma counter was used for determining activity levels at the various counting stations. The equipment was removed in November 1956 after demonstrating satisfactory removal of solids from the system.

7-4. 8 The HRE-2 instrument and control system. The control system for a homogeneous reactor such as the HRE-2 differs drastically from that for solid-fuel reactors because control rods and fast electronic circuitry are not necessary for systems with such large temperature coefficients (nearly 0. 3% Δk/°C at 280°C for the HRE-2). 7-4. 9 The HRE-2 instrumentation system.

Functions similar to those performed by control rods in heterogeneous reactors, but without such exacting speed-of-response requirements, are performed by valves which control the concentration of the fuel, which vary the steam-removal rate from the heat exchangers, or which allow the fuel to be discharged to noncritical low-pressure storage tanks. For these reasons, the nuclear control circuits for a homogeneous reactor are designed to limit very rapid changes in fuel concentration and steam-removal rates. Other circuits control the pressures and temperature limits of the circulating liquid fuel, principally to prevent equipment damage.

All critical core- and blanket-system transmitters, except electric level transmitters and thermocouples, are located in two shielded instrument cubicles (5 ft diameter x 15 ft high) located adjacent to, but outside, the main reactor tank. This arrangement was selected to avoid opening the main tank to replace instruments and to provide a location for the control rod drive mechanisms, which are located in a separate shielded room, also used as an instrument and electrical equipment room.

The cell air monitors, which provide an alarm in case of a leak of radioactive vapor from the reactor system, are installed in one of these instrument cubicles. Cell air is circulated through a 2-inch pipe from the reactor tank, past the enclosed monitors, and then back to the cell. The blower is sized so that only 5 seconds is required for cell air to reach the radiation monitors.

Figure 7-16 indicates several key control loops: (a) The pressure of the core system is controlled from sensed pressure by the proportioning of power to the pressurizer electric heaters, and the blanket pressure is similarly controlled by a core-to-blanket differential-pressure signal. (b) The liquid levels in the pressurizers are controlled from sensed levels by pneumatic control of the letdown valves. Pneumatic control actions are derived from transducers which receive signals from electric transmitters. Electric interlock control of the pneumatic signals to final control elements is achieved by the use of solenoid-actuated pilot valves.

Other control loops not illustrated are: (c) The reactor power is controlled by a manual or turbine-governor signal to a valve throttling steam from the core heat exchanger. Because of the large negative temperature coefficient and low heat capacity, this reactor system cannot produce more heat than is being removed, except for very short times. Heat is removed by opening the steam throttling valve, which causes a decrease in the temperature of the fuel leaving the heat exchanger.

(a) As the cooler fuel enters the core, it causes an increase in reactivity that is counteracted by reheating the fuel until it overcomes the excess reactivity. (b) The temperature coefficient of reactivity determines how much the reactivity changes with changes in temperature. (c) The coolant flow rate and power extraction determine the core temperature, while the blanket temperature is controlled by the steam withdrawal valve of the blanket heat exchanger.

Nuclear instrumentation. Neutron level transmitters are two Westinghouse fission chambers and two gamma-compensated ionization chambers designed by the Oak Ridge National Laboratory. Neither type of instrument requires a gas purge, and both are amenable to operation in the water-filled thimbles (-17); which allow the chambers to be positioned or replaced during reactor operation. Varying the distance of the chambers from the reactor core affords a means of sensitivity adjustment, which is needed to accommodate different operating powers.

Neutron flux of approximately 10^10 at 5-MW power to utilize their measuring range of 10°. The lower limit of their range of operation is comparable to the maximum desirable flux for proper operation of the fission chambers. Therefore, it was possible to install the two types of sensing elements in the same area in the reactor cell. At high fluxes, the fission chambers, which are required to follow the neutron flux for five decades during start-up, are withdrawn into a protective boral shield to limit fission-product buildup in the chamber lining.

The fission chamber signals are fed to conventional preamplifiers, A-1 linear amplifiers, logarithmic count-rate meters, and a dual-pen recorder. For initial reactor startup before gamma-neutron reactions provided a sizable neutron source, the fission chamber output was used to drive a low-range pulse counter.

Control panel. Figure 7-18 shows the main control board and console. Here are located only those instruments necessary for the safe operation of the reactor. These are arranged in a "visual aid" form to reduce operational errors and to facilitate the training of operators.

Key measurements are displayed on full-scale recorders in the center section of the panel and include the fuel temperature, a multipoint temperature recorder, the multiarea radiation monitoring recorder, the reactor power, the logarithmic neutron-level, and count-rate meter signals.

The patch panel on the extreme left is a "jumper board," which is a schematic representation of the electrical control circuits. Provision is made for jumping certain individual contacts in the control circuit with a plug. Lights indicate the position (open or closed) of the contact in the system. The board is valuable for making temporary control-circuit alterations necessary for experiments and makes it unnecessary to use jumper wires, which are normally placed behind the panel. If overlooked and not removed, they might introduce a hazardous condition.

Data collection instruments and the transducers that drive the miniature pneumatic slave recorders on the graphic panel are located in an auxiliary instrument gallery beneath the main control room. Also housed in this area are a 548-point thermocouple patch panel, a relay panel, the nuclear instrument amplifiers, and the nuclear instrument power supplies.

Other panels located near their respective equipment elsewhere in the building include the steam control station, the turbine control panel, two sampler control panels, and a control station for the refrigeration system supplying the cold traps. Standard 2-ft-wide modular cabinets and panels are used throughout to facilitate design changes.

(a) The pumping up of fuel to the reactor core, instead of condensate, is prevented by several interlocks, which keep the fuel addition valve closed until the core is full of condensate and has been heated to 200°C. This prevents power surges and consequent pressure increases. (b) For the same reason, the fuel circulating pump is started in reverse to provide a low flow rate as protection against pumping cold fuel too rapidly from the heat exchanger into the core. (c) To avoid dangerous thermal stresses and abrupt reactivity surges, the control circuits do not permit the pumping of cold feedwater into the heat exchangers until the level is above 50%. (d) To give a smooth startup, the fuel injection pump can run only at half-speed until a temperature of 250°C is reached. (e) The fuel feed valve will be closed, and the concentration in the fuel system will be lowered by injecting condensate if the core outlet temperature becomes excessive, if the circulating pump stops, or if the power level exceeds normal. (f) The contents of the high-pressure systems will be automatically emptied to the low-pressure storage tanks through the dump valves on a signal of extremely high pressure or a radiation leak into the steam system. Differential pressure control between the core and blanket systems during dumps is by throttling control of valves from a differential pressure signal.

Inventory systems. To obtain an accurate inventory of the fuel and moderator solutions, the storage and condensate tanks are weighed with pneumatic weigh cells. A pneumatic system was selected primarily because taring can be done remotely by balancing air pressures, and components are less susceptible to radiation damage. Piping to the tanks is kept flexible to compensate for the varying loads which result from thermal expansion.

The volumes of the fuel and blanket high-pressure systems have been accurately measured so that when the pressurizer condensate reservoirs are filled to capacity, the weight of liquid in the high-pressure systems can be computed from the core, blanket, and pressurizer temperatures.

7~4. 9 Remote maintenance. Maintenance of the equipment in the circulating systems of an aqueous homogeneous reactor is difficult because of the intense radioactivity emanating from the surfaces following prolonged operation at high power levels. This problem, more acute than in the case of heterogeneous reactors because fission-product activities and neutrons are not confined to the reactor core, must be successfully resolved in a practical manner if the homogeneous reactor is to be an economical power producer. Practical systems for maintenance and repair must provide adequate personnel shielding to reduce radiations from activated equipment to tolerable biological values while simultaneously providing access to the equipment.

Equipment activation: Of the two principal methods by means of which the equipment is rendered radioactive, activation by fission-product contamination is the more important in the HRE-2. About 30% of the fission products are normally removed from the fuel solution as gases (xenon, krypton, iodine) by stripping with O2, De, and steam. Of the remaining fission products, 56% are estimated to have sufficiently low solubilities to precipitate from the solution as solids. Therefore, so far as activation of equipment is concerned, the rare gases (about 30%) and the soluble products (about 12%), making up 42% of the total, may be considered removed or easily removable from the equipment. Some portion of the remaining 58% will deposit on hot metallic surfaces or be retained in cracks and crevices. It is possible, by statistical analysis, to estimate within a factor of two the specific gamma and beta activity of the fuel solution. Methods for calculating this activity have been published. The initial fuel activity, after prolonged HRE-2 operation, is of the order of 25 curies per milliliter.

Induced activation of structural materials by neutron absorption is also an important contributor to radioactivity during operation of the reactor. During operation, a thermal flux exterior to the equipment items will be present due to neutron leakage from the reactor vessel. Also, delayed neutrons will be emitted in the interior of the piping and equipment from fission products.

In the fuel solution, these neutron fluxes may be estimated, and knowing the surface areas and material constituents of the equipment, the resulting induced activation may be calculated.

The effect of induced activation may be controlled to some extent by attenuating neutron leakage from the reactor through an adequate thermal neutron shield surrounding the reactor vessel. Also, the constituents of the structural materials in the cell may be specified in such a manner that elements of potentially high neutron activation, such as the cobalt normally present in stainless steels, are minimized. Other materials, such as boron, which has a high neutron-capture cross-section and is an alpha emitter rather than a gamma radiator, might be used on equipment surfaces to minimize induced activity.

Radiation dosages. Design criteria followed in the design of shielding, and periods of intense maintenance, it may sometimes be permissible to allow personnel to work in an area of higher than normal radiation, but the total weekly radiation dosage must be held to 300 mr or less. In some instances, it is necessary to work in relays so that no one person receives a higher than permissible weekly dosage.

Proposed maintenance concepts. The concepts which have been proposed for the maintenance of equipment in the HRE-2 have been based on the philosophy of either dry maintenance or underwater maintenance or combinations of the two. In general, it is assumed that the item requiring repair will be replaced with a new item, and the faulty component removed to a shielded hot-cell area for maintenance.

Tests of underwater maintenance procedures proposed for HRE-2 using special tools and equipment have demonstrated the feasibility of removing and replacing equipment. In these tests, it was demonstrated that contamination of the heavy-water fuel solution by shielding water could be prevented by freezing a plug of heavy ice in the pipe before disconnecting equipment. Freeze jackets are placed around piping at flange disconnects for this purpose. Also, in HRE-2, the insulation around piping was designed to avoid the retention of water after draining the flooded equipment.

Piping joints. Removal of equipment in the HRE-2 depends on flanged joints adjacent to the equipment, which may be disconnected and remade with suitably designed tooling. The joints in the HRE-2 use American Standard stainless-steel ring-joint, weld-neck flanges modified to permit leak detection (-13). These flanges are located so that all bolting is accessible from above without disturbing equipment or piping.

Remotely operable tools. Tools used in the HRE-2 maintenance procedures are generally simple, rugged units mounted on long handles. They include manual, air-operated, and water-operated socket wrenches for turning nuts, hooks for lifting, clamps, knives, magnets, etc. Some typical maintenance devices are illustrated in Figs. 7-19 through 7-22 and described as follows: Figure 7-19. Hydraulic pump and cylinder assembly. Figure 7-20. Air hose reel. Figure 7-21. Air impact wrench. Figure 7-22. Manual torque wrench.

The universal high-pressure valve jig shown in Figure 19 is used for manufacturing replacement high-pressure flanges for the HRE-2. By placing brackets in appropriate holes referenced with respect to the 21 high-pressure HRE-2 valves, the position of the flanged pipe ends for any one of the valves may be accurately determined. With this device, the required number of spare valves for the reactor is minimized, and at the same time, any valve that fails can be remotely replaced.

The spinner wrench in -20 is used for removing bolts quickly after they are loosened with a high-torque wrench, for spinning the bolts snug before final tightening, and by use of a right-angle bevel-gear attachment (not shown), for handling bolts in a horizontal position. It has a chain drive offset to fit bolts not accessible by direct drive, such as bolts hidden under pipe fittings and bends.

The flange spreader tool (-21) is required in remote operations to spread low-pressure valve flanges to prevent damage to the ring gasket during removal or insertion of the valves. The tool is shown in place with the flanges spread and the valve assembly moved back on its cell fixture.

Even in the relatively short operating history of HRE-2, the concept of underwater repairs with tools such as those described above has been proved to be completely practical. Soon after the reactor attained significant power, it was found necessary to replace all the electrical power wiring - nearly 4000 ft of wire. This was accomplished in a period of three weeks, with the cell completely flooded. During this period, the fuel circulating pump was removed to recover a set of corrosion samples.

Would have been the total shutdown time if the pump replacement alone had been performed. Also, the core inspection flange was removed, and the core inner surface inspected by means of a periscope. In these three major underwater maintenance operations, no delay or difficulty was experienced.

Detection equipment, namely, 0. 1 cc of helium (STP) per day, allowing for several such minimum leaks, the equivalent loss of liquid at 300°C and at 2000 psig could be as great as 5 cc per day, or a total leakage of approximately 250 curies per day. Because of its volume and surface area, and because of the difficulty in measuring small leakage from very large vessels, the leakage rate for the reactor tank was set at 10 liters/min or less at a test pressure of 15 psi. As indicated in Article 7-4. 4, actual leakages were below this value.

The problem of leakage from reactor vessels and piping can be catalogued according to various mechanisms through which leakage might result as follows: 1. Excessive stresses, 2. Defective materials or workmanship, 3. Corrosion, 4. Nuclear accidents, 5. Hydrogen-oxygen explosions, and 6. Brittle fracture. Each possibility is examined in detail in the discussion which follows.

With which the system was fabricated. This permits an additional factor by the ASA code for pressure piping. The reactor piping arrangement was examined for maximum stresses due to pressure, as well as for hoop and bending stresses resulting from thermal expansion. Equipment was also studied for determining the magnitude of thermal stresses caused by radiation heating and temperature cycling. Therefore, in order to keep the combined thermal and pressure stresses below the maximum allowable working stress, the pressure-vessel wall is approximately 2 in. thicker than would be required otherwise. Heating and cooling rates on the entire system have been limited to 100°F/hr and 55°F/hr, respectively, and the differential temperature across heavy metal walls is kept below 100°F. (The cooling rate is held below the heating rate to minimize the rate of flange contraction).

Cyclic temperature stresses at questionable points in the reactor pressure vessel and steam generators were explored experimentally. Mockups were fabricated for the testing of the pressure vessel nozzle joints and the stainless steel-to-Zircaloy bolted joint inside the pressure vessel. In each cycle, the joints were found to be sound. Several tube joints cracked open during the first 50 cycles. They were repaired, and the heat exchangers were subjected to an additional 10 cycles before final acceptance.

Defective materials or workmanship. All materials for the primary systems of HRE-2 were procured to specifications considerably more rigid than those existing in commercial practice. Optional requirements such as chemical analyses, boiling nitric acid tests, and macroetch tests were exercised in all materials specifications. An additional cost, averaging about 10%, was experienced in the purchase of materials under the more rigid specifications. In some instances, for example with the heat-exchanger tubes, special ultrasonic and magnetic eddy-current flaw detectors were employed to indicate defective parts. Three tubes that might have later failed in operation were thus eliminated. Dye-penetrant tests were applied to tubing bends and to all welds throughout the reactor to detect cracks and pinholes.

Special attention was given to the welding of stainless steel butt joints, of which there are approximately 2000 in the entire reactor. The inert-gas, non-consumable electrode method was used almost entirely. Welds were inspected to considerably higher standards than required by the ASME code.

Corrosion. Although corrosion is an ever-present possibility for leakage, the HRE-2 was designed to reduce attack rates so far as possible by keeping velocities below 20 fps, temperatures in the range of 250 to 300°C, and lining some surface areas with titanium for additional resistance.

Nuclear accidents are likely to be rare in homogeneous reactors because of their large negative temperature coefficient (0.1 to 0.2% Δk/°C). As an example, the worst accident considered in the HRE-2 was one in which all the uranium suddenly collects in the reactor core and results in a reactivity increase of 2. 5% Δk/sec. For this rate, starting at a power of only 0. 4 watts, the maximum pressure in the pressure vessel would be approximately 3900 lb, and the pressure stress in the carbon steel shell would be less than 30,000 psi.

Hydrogen-oxygen explosions. Since radiolytic gases (deuterium and oxygen) are produced continuously in the reactor, they are the source of an ever-present hazard. Explosions may be expected whenever the deuterium-oxygen-steam mixture is more than 15% gas. For detonations, the required gas fraction is greater. The maximum increase in pressure from an adiabatic explosion of hydrogen and oxygen is only a factor of 3 to 8, whereas for a detonation, the factor might be 23 for an undiluted mixture. It is important to note that detonations can occur only in gas channels that are relatively long and straight.

In low-pressure areas of HRE-2, the gas was diluted with steam to keep it noncombustible. Furthermore, a pressure of 500 psi is the basis for the design of low-pressure (atmospheric) equipment. Even for a detonation, the expected peak pressure would be less than the design pressure.

Although an explosion can be tolerated in the high-pressure system with little danger of vessel rupture, a detonation probably could not be. A detonation could occur in the gas separator where the gas channel (the vortex by which the radiolytic gas is collected) is long and straight. It is calculated that a detonation wave traveling longitudinally along the vortex would produce impact pressures of the order of 30,000 psi, but the damage would be limited to the directional vanes inside the separator. Attenuation of the forces by the solution would limit the pressure rise to that resulting from combustion of the gas—10,000 psia, which produces a tolerable wall fiber stress of 35,000 psi. Thus, no serious damage is foreseen from explosions or detonations.

Brittle fracture. It is generally known that ferritic steels are subject to the phenomenon of brittle fracture.

A sudden release of the liquid contents of the fuel and blanket systems, of approximately 30 psi inside the reactor shield. Although it is somewhat difficult to design a large (25,000 cu ft) rectangular container such as the HRE-2 container to withstand a 30-psig pressure, it was even more difficult to design it to withstand heavy missiles. Studies indicated that missile velocities of 50 to 150 fps could be expected. With the HRE-2 vessel, which weighs 16,000 lb, 1600-lb fragments might be expected. Such a mass at 100 fps would lift an unrestrained 5-ft-thick concrete shielding plug nearly 1 ft. For this reason, a blast shield was placed around the vessel.

The blast shield was designed to withstand the 1250-psig pressure which would result from the 300°C liquid, as well as to absorb the energy of the expanding steam. A 1-in. -thick wall made of type-304 stainless steel was found to be capable of absorbing 2. 85 x 10° ft-lb of energy with 2% elongation. The fragments from the pressure vessel would accumulate this much energy in traveling across an annulus of 4. 8 in.

A similar shield made of carbon steel was installed on both fuel and blanket steam generators as a final precaution against an explosion that might damage other equipment and the vapor barrier sufficiently to cause a release of activity. The probability of failure of the steam generator shells would not be affected by the presence of neutron radiation because the generators are located in a low flux region.

The vapor-tight container. If leakage of radioactive solution from the reactor proper occurs through one of the means mentioned above, an all-welded, vapor-tight tank provides a second barrier to the escape of radiation to the atmosphere. Construction details of this tank, which forms the liner for the biological shield, are illustrated in Figure 8. After completion of construction, the tank was given a hydrostatic test at an average pressure of 32 psig, and the welded joints were found to be free of leaks. It was then reopened for further installation of reactor equipment.

7-4. 11 Summary of HRE-2 design and construction experience. Following the completion of HRE-2, personnel associated with the project recommended design improvements which might be applied to good advantage in future homogeneous reactors. These recommendations are summarized in the following paragraphs: 1. The use of a refractory metal fuel element is recommended for future homogeneous reactors. This would eliminate the need for a cladding and simplify the fuel handling system. 2. The use of an aluminum alloy as the moderator material is also recommended. This would provide better thermal conductivity than copper, which was used in HRE-2. 3. A more efficient heat exchanger design should be developed to improve the efficiency of the reactor system. 4. The use of a more robust fuel element design is recommended to improve reliability and reduce maintenance requirements. 5. Improved control rod design is needed to simplify the control system and improve safety margins. 6.

(1) There are many components in the HRE-2 system that must operate together to ensure continuous operation of the reactor. Any failure of one component could lead to a shutdown of the reactor. (2) The control rods are used to absorb neutrons and control the rate of fission within the fuel elements. (3) The coolant is circulated through the core, where it absorbs heat from the fuel elements and carries it away to be dissipated in the steam generator. (4) The moderator slows down the neutrons so that they are more likely to cause fission when they collide with uranium atoms. (5) The fuel elements contain enriched uranium, which undergoes nuclear fission when bombarded by neutrons.

In a reactor, the probability of shutdown is higher than it would be with components operating independently. In future reactors, an attempt should be made to decrease the dependency upon the simultaneous operation of essential components. An example of this is a system that can be operated without continuous letdown from the high-pressure to the low-pressure system, so that failure of the low-pressure system components will not necessarily require shutdown of the entire reactor system.

The reactor cell for the HRE-2 contains many structural components made of carbon steel. Flooding the cell with water and removing radioactive contamination by use of acids will eventually do serious damage to all these carbon steel surfaces.

In laying out equipment and piping, provision should be made for walkways, stairs, and ladders to provide convenient access during construction without having to climb on the process and service piping. These walkways, ladders, and stairs may or may not be removable after completion of construction.

Many items installed inside the reactor cell of the HRE-2 might have been located outside the radioactive area. These include the cold traps, which could be located in one of the shielded waste-system compartments, the space coolers, and a number of other nonradioactive components.

In the HRE-2, the sampler is located adjacent to the cell shield, and it is necessary to remove the sample from the sampler and carry it to the analytical laboratory in a shielded carrier. The risk of contamination can be greatly reduced if the hot laboratory is built around the sampler so that samples may be analyzed without removal from the shield; however, this would add to the cost of the facility.

Access through the containment seal, which consists of welded pans, can be made easier through the use of mechanical seals with organic gaskets.

Control of all operations affecting the reactor should be located in one central control room. This includes the controls for the chemical processing system, as well as those for the reactor system and all main controls for the steam turbine and steam auxiliaries. This does not mean, however, that all instrumentation must be in the control room, but only those things which are necessary to keep the reactor operator informed and to provide him with primary control of the operation.

Decompose under irradiation to release chlorides or fluorides detrimental to the stainless steel piping. Carbon dioxide was not selected because the piping would have to be designed to withstand about 1500 psi. A solution to this problem would be to use copper for all tubing and equipment in contact with the refrigerant; in which case, Freon could be used inside the cell.

7-4. 12 HRE-2 construction costs. These costs are summarized in Table 7-7, including that portion of the costs due to the requirement for preventing the possible escape of radioactive material from the reactor to the building or surroundings.

7-5. 1 Introduction. Homogeneous reactors fueled with uranium oxide dissolved in concentrated aqueous solutions of phosphoric acid have a number of advantages compared with dilute aqueous uranyl solutions for certain power reactor applications. These applications are based on the fact that concentrated phosphoric acid solutions have high thermal stability and low vapor pressures. This makes it possible to operate at relatively high temperatures without creating the excessive pressures encountered with dilute aqueous solutions. These temperatures are high enough to take advantage of the back reaction for recombination of gases produced by radiolytic decomposition and to eliminate the need for an external gas system or an internal catalyst. In addition, the high hydrogen density and the relatively low neutron-absorption cross sections of the phosphoric acid system permit the construction of small, compact reactors with a low inventory of fuel, which may be ideal for remote package power plants. Other advantages include the possibility of continuous removal of fission-product poisons and a strong negative temperature coefficient of reactivity.

Although the advantages of uranium oxide in concentrated phosphoric acid solutions present a strong case for such a fuel system, the disadvantages, though few in number, are ponderous. In fact, one disadvantage, the highly corrosive nature of the phosphoric acid to most metals, may well outweigh all of the advantages. The only metals known to be suitably resistant to phosphoric acid in the concentration and temperature ranges of interest are gold and platinum.

Fuel solution and all structural metals with which it might come in contact are extremely difficult to solve. This problem was not solved in the first experimental reactor to use a phosphoric acid system, the LAPRE-1; however, considerable improvements in fabrication and testing techniques have been developed for use in the construction of LAPRE-2.

Of the wide range of possible combinations of uranium oxide, phosphoric acid, and water, two systems appear to be of special interest. The first, which consists of UO3 dissolved in an aqueous solution containing between 30 and 60 w/o of phosphoric acid and pressurized with an oxygen overpressure, was used for the first Los Alamos Power Reactor Experiment (LAPRE-1). The properties of this solution are given in Chapter 3 and summarized in Table 7-8. The vapor pressure of this solution at the design operating temperature of LAPRE-1 (430°C) is 3600 psi.

The second solution (to be used in LAPRE-2) consists of UO2 dissolved in a 95 wt% phosphoric acid and pressurized with a hydrogen overpressure. As seen from Table 7-1, the vapor pressure of this solution at 450°C is only about 800 psi. Because of its reducing properties, the corrosive behavior of this solution is such that anything below hydrogen in the electromotive series is only slowly attacked. Since the attack rate is proportional to the position of the metals in the series, possible materials in decreasing order of usefulness are platinum, gold, carbon, silver, and copper. Although neither silver nor copper is attacked at a rapid rate, both metals undergo mass transfer, and suitable means for inhibiting this must be found before they can be considered practical for lining the reactor.

7-5. 2 Description of LAPRE-1. The first experimental reactor, LAPRE-1, was housed in a cell at the Los Alamos site, which had been built previously to handle highly radioactive materials. The cell was modified by supplementing the shielding with additional concrete on one side and lead on the other sides and ceiling. A stainless-steel wall was also put across the reactor end of the cell to permit filling with water for a neutron shield. Equipment such as the solution transfer pump and sampling system located on the wall of the cell. Figure 7-23 shows a plan view of the LAPRE-1 reactor area.

Figure 7-24 shows an artist's sketch of LAPRE-1 in which the essential features of the reactor are indicated. As will be seen from this sketch, the 15-in. -ID cylindrical reactor contains a critical zone above the cooling coils and a reservoir region below. This latter region, which contains a hollow cylinder of boron to prevent criticality, provided a storage place for excess fuel and avoided the necessity for transferring the highly radioactive fuel solution in and out of the reactor as its temperature changed.

Large negative temperature coefficient of reactivity made it impossible to compensate for the excess reactivity of the cold critical reactor, and it was not considered practical to change the fuel concentration as is done in the HRE-2. In the LAPRE-1, shim control was achieved by means of the thermal expansion of the fuel. This was accomplished by initially filling the reactor with the cold phosphoric acid fuel solution to a level about 7 to 8 in. above the cooling coils. At this level, the reactor would become critical on removal of the control rods; the solution would heat up, expand, and gradually fill the critical zone. On cooling, the reverse process took place, making the reactor self-compensating. The reactor vessel was so designed that at 430°C, the operating temperature, the fluid level would reach a point just above the flow baffle.

To 240°C by using electrical heaters located around the exterior of the vessel. This was done to minimize the positive reactivity change resulting from starting up the fuel circulating pump, which caused a rapid injection of lower temperature fuel solution from the reservoir into the core.

Heat removal from LAPRE-1 was accomplished by circulating the fuel solution at 600 gpm over the cooling coils using the centrifugal sealed rotor pump shown in Figure 24. The 12-gpm feed-water stream, heated to 800°F in passing through the cooling coils, was simply discharged to the atmosphere through a quick-closing throttling valve and steam silencer as a means of dumping heat. The possibility of fission products escaping through the steam discharge line was prevented by installing a 70-sec holdup line, suitably monitored for radioactivity, between the reactor and throttling valve.

Obtained at room temperature in terms of control-rod position at delayed critical versus volume of fuel injected into the system, and results were interpreted in terms of a simplified calculational model to obtain control rod worths. For the five control rods, four located on a 37%-in. radius and one central rod, measurements yielded a total worth of 6. 3%. The latter results were in good agreement with period measurements at cold critical.

With the reactor filled to a predetermined level at room temperature, initial heating of the system was achieved by means of electrical heaters disposed around the outside of the vessel. Heat was applied until a core temperature of 240°C was attained; then heating by nuclear power was initiated. Only during the forced convection phase of the operation was a uniform temperature distribution established in the fuel solution prior to starting the circulator.

Data were obtained during the course of the experiment in terms of control rod positions versus core temperature at delayed critical. For the operation without the circulator, thermocouples located at various points in the system provided data from which average core and reservoir temperatures could be estimated. Above this point, a further increase in height did not contribute to the reactivity; hence, the system was solely governed by the temperature coefficient of reactivity.

A maximum temperature of 390°C at an operating power of about 150 kW was achieved in the experiment. No steam data were obtained during the test because of a failure in the heat-exchanger assembly after a number of hours of operation. Inspection of the assembly after a cooling-off period indicated that a rupture in the gold cladding of two of the lead-in tubes was responsible for the failure.

7-5. 4 Description of LAPRE-2. The second power reactor experiment, LAPRE-2, was constructed in an underground steel tank 50 inches in diameter and 20 feet long located at a site approximately 100 feet from LAPRE-1. A sketch of the reactor is shown in Figure-25. Because of the lower vapor pressure of the LAPRE-2 fuel solution, the design and method of construction of the reactor vessel have a simple autoclave shape with relatively thin (5/8-inch) walls. This compares with the 3-inch-thick vessel required for the core, which has the advantage of providing a noncritical region for excess liquid in case of overfilling. Cooling is accomplished by natural convection circulation of the fuel solution over the cooling coils. Fuel circulation is aided by an inverted platinum cone in the core region. A 1-foot-thick graphite reflector surrounds the vessel. The inner 6 inches of this reflector can be moved slowly to adjust the reactivity at varying fuel concentrations.

From a water-cooled copper tank pressurized with hydrogen, the line becomes critical with cold fuel solution. Further additions are made until the desired operating temperature of 430°C is reached. A separate pancake-shaped cooling coil, located just above the main tube bundle, serves as a level indicator. A thermocouple in the discharge of this coil indicates whether there is power removal and thus if the coil is immersed.

All parts of LAPRE-2 are completely clad with fifteen mils of gold to provide 100% protection of the structural metal from the fuel solution. This gold, as well as the platinum and noble metals used in LAPRE-1, is recoverable after conclusion of the reactor experiments.

The 600-psi, 600°F steam produced in the LAPRE-2 is somewhat lower quality than that produced by LAPRE-1 because of the lower operating pressures. However, at a design level of 1. 3 Mw heat, the reactor could produce 250 kW of electricity, which is acceptable for a remote power station.

The reliability of equipment for handling radioactive fuel solutions and suspensions is considerably more important in homogeneous than in heterogeneous reactors because the residual radioactivity of such equipment after the shutdown of the reactor precludes direct maintenance. The possibility of failures of individual components in a homogeneous reactor, moreover, is considerably increased by the corrosive or erosive nature of the media being handled and the temperature fluctuations encountered during startup and shutdown operations. The technical feasibility of circulating-fuel reactors is so dependent on the behavior and reliability of mechanical components that there is little likelihood that large-scale plants will be built before the performance of each piece of equipment has been adequately demonstrated. In this regard, the development of satisfactory valves, feed pumps, mechanical joints, and remote maintenance equipment for large-scale plants appears to be most difficult.

Since suspensions, or slurries, have not been used in either of the homogeneous reactors built by ORNL, the slurry equipment problems have received less attention than corresponding solution problems. Much of the solution technology can be applied to slurries, although additional difficulties such as the settling tendency of slurries, their less ideal fluid-flow behavior, and their erosiveness must be taken into consideration.

Three geometries which satisfy the above requirements have been investigated. The first, straight-through, involves diffusing the inlet flow through screens or perforated plates to achieve slug flow through the sphere. The second, mixed, involves generating a great deal of turbulence and mixing with the inlet jet so that the reactor is very nearly isothermal. The third, rotational, is somewhat between the first two - the fuel is introduced tangentially to the sphere and withdrawn at the center of a vortex, at the north and south poles.

In the straight-through core used in HRE-2, the flow enters upward through a conical diffuser containing perforated plates. The number of perforated plates is determined by the ratio of sphere diameter to inlet-pipe diameter. In general, this ratio will be smaller for a larger reactor, resulting in fewer plates and better performance. The velocity distribution leaving the plates can be made to conform approximately to the flux distribution of the reactor. As a result, the isotherms in the core are horizontal, and the temperature rises smoothly toward the outlet at the top. The gas bubbles rise upward at a velocity greater than that of the liquid and are removed heads. The core tank is cooled by natural convection.

In the mixed core, illustrated in Figure 1, the inlet and outlet are concentric at the top of the sphere. The inlet jet coincides with the vertical axis of the sphere and is broken up when it hits the bottom surface. Except for the cold central jet, the bulk of the core is at outlet temperature. The velocity of eddies is great enough so that the gas bubbles travel along with. The core-tank surface is maintained at a temperature very close to that of the core fluid by the high turbulence.

In the rotational core used in HRE-1, the flow pattern tends to produce isotherms, which are vertical cylinders. These are perturbed by boundary layer mixing at the sphere walls. The temperature generally increases in the direction of the central axis, which is at the outlet temperature. The gas bubbles are centrifuged rapidly into a gas void, which forms at the central axis and from which gas can be removed. The gas void is quite stable in cores up to about 2 ft in diameter, but in larger spheres, the pumping requirements to stabilize the void are excessive. The pressure drop through a rotational core is a function of the particular system but is usually above 5 inlet-velocity heads.

Slurry blanket hydrodynamics. The suspension contained in the blanket vessel must be sufficiently well dispersed to assure that a maximum of the core leakage neutrons are absorbed within the blanket; the neutron reflection from the blanket to the core remains steady, and the transport of fluids through regions of high heat generation is sufficient for heat removal. The primary flow is taken through a jet eductor where the flow rate is amplified and forced through a spherical annulus containing the high heat generation region surrounding the core. It appears that amplification gains of 2. 5 are attainable. The outlet may be located either (1) concentric with the bottom inlet or (2) at the top. Configuration (1) has the advantage of high circulation rates in the region outside the shroud. Configuration (2) has the advantage of better natural circulation in the event of a circulating-pump stoppage.

Reactor pressure vessels. The three principal types of stresses that should be considered in designing the pressure vessels of one- or two-region reactors are: 1) Hoop stress, which is caused by the internal pressure acting on the cylindrical wall of the vessel; 2) Axial stress, which is caused by the weight of the fuel and coolant above the bottom head of the vessel; and 3) Radial stress, which is caused by the temperature gradient across the thickness of the vessel.

Usually, the pressure vessel wall is thin in comparison to the inner radius of the vessel; hence, "thin-wall formulas" for calculating pressure stresses are applicable. For precise calculations, the general equations for vessels with any wall thickness should be used.

Although it may be possible to obtain the heat-production function for the desired cylindrical or spherical geometry, it is simpler and usually sufficiently accurate to obtain the leakage fluxes of gamma rays and neutrons into the pressure shell for the desired geometry and then to assume that the heat-production function in the pressure vessel is the same as it would be in a plate of the same material. The function can usually be described by the sum and difference of several exponentials. For some purposes, a single exponential can be used as a satisfactory approximation. The accuracy of the various methods has yet to be determined. To arrive at a conservative design, reasonable methods indicating the greatest amount of heat generation should be used.

Chapman has shown in an analysis of thermal stresses in spherical reactor vessels that minimum thermal stresses are obtained when the inner and outer vessel wall temperatures are approximately equal. Pressure stresses decrease and thermal stresses increase as shell thickness is increased; a minimum combined stress occurs at an optimum wall thickness. Often, this stress is greater than the permissible design stress; thermal shielding must then be provided between the reactor and pressure vessel to reduce heat production and obtain a reasonable stress.

HRE-2 core and pressure vessel. The HRE-2 reactor-vessel assembly presented a number of special design and fabrication problems. Type-347 stainless steel was used as a cladding material due to its excellent corrosion resistance and high temperature strength.

Steel, the pressure vessel was surrounded by a stainless steel, water-cooled blast shield, which will stop any possible missiles from the reactor vessel.

A special mechanical joint was developed to join the Zircaloy core tank to the stainless steel piping system. A bellows expansion joint was used to permit differential thermal expansion between the core and pressure vessel. Welding procedures were developed for joining Zircaloy and for making the final girth weld in the clad pressure vessel entirely from the outside.

8-2. 2 Circulating pumps. Pumps are required in aqueous homogeneous reactors to circulate solutions and slurries at 250 to 300°C and 2000 psi pressure, at heads of up to 100 psi. The two main considerations for these pumps are that they must be absolutely leak-free and that they must have a long maintenance-free life.

At this time, only hermetically sealed canned-motor centrifugal pumps are considered capable of meeting these requirements. These pumps consist of a centrifugal pump of standard hydraulic design and an electric drive motor built in an integral unit.

To illustrate, the 400A pump used to circulate fuel solution in the HRE-2 is shown in Figure 3. The HRE-2 blanket pump is identical except for having a lower-output impeller. The hydraulic end of the pump is separated from the motor by the thermal barrier, which is used to restrict the transfer of heat and fluid from the scroll into the motor section of the pump. This minimizes thermal and radiation damage to bearings and motor insulation. The thermal barrier is built with sealed air spaces which aid in thermal insulation. A labyrinth seal around the shaft is used to reduce the fuel mixing into the motor. Water-lubricated hydrodynamic journal bearings and pivoted-shoe-type thrust bearings are used to take the radial and thrust loads, respectively. In the HRE-2, contact of the motor and bearings with radioactive solutions is minimized by feeding distilled water continuously into the motor.

The electric drive is a three-phase squirrel-cage induction motor with the stator and rotor sealed in thin stainless-steel cans, which prevent the process fluid from coming into contact with the stator or rotor windings. The cans are supported by the laminations to contain the system pressure of 2000 psi. The motor is enclosed in a heavy pressure vessel, which is designed to hold the full system pressure in the event of a can failure.

In the HRE-2, it is usually desirable to run the fuel pump at reduced capacity during startups in order to limit reactivity changes. This is accomplished by starting the 400A pump in reverse, which gives about one-half of the normal flow. The ability to do this depends on the design of the impeller and the size of the pump. In larger pumps, it is considered better to use a two-speed motor to obtain the reduced-capacity operation. The two-speed motor has an additional advantage in permitting the system to be heated to operating density at reduced speed, thereby reducing the required motor size and power consumption.

The service life of the 400A pump, based on out-of-pile tests with solutions, is expected to be two years or more. The slurry pumps currently being operated have not proved as reliable as the solution pumps, but runs of up to 3800 hours have been obtained. The hydraulic parts of the pump are frequently severely eroded, but there has not been a significant change in the pump output or power requirements during the runs. The pumps will generally continue to run unless a bearing seizes or breaks down. It is expected that improvements in bearings and hydraulic design will make slurry pumps as reliable as solution pumps.

Stators. Pumps have been built with oil-filled stators to improve heat removal from the windings and to balance the pressure across the stator can. These pumps are undesirable for long-term reactor service because the oil is subject to radiation damage and requires frequent replacement. Pressure-balanced stator cans have also proved to be unsatisfactory because of the difficulty in maintaining the proper balance. In pumps of up to 400-gpm capacity, the problem of cooling the stator windings does not seem too severe, and the dry-stator design with the can capable of withstanding the full 2000-psi system pressure seems to be the best and most commonly used type.

Most manufacturers insulate their motors with Class H insulation consisting of Fiberglass cloth impregnated with a silicone varnish binder. This insulation is probably good for several years of operation in circulating-fuel reactors, depending on the radiation level of the pump. Over time, the insulation can be expected to fail because of the decrease in resistivity and dielectric strength. Hydrogen, released from the silicone varnish during irradiation, may also build up enough pressure to rupture the stator case when the system pressure is reduced. The HRE-2 is expected to yield much information on motor life.

Circulating pump of the HRE-2 indicated that the insulation will be subject to failure in approximately five years, assuming that the outside of the motor is protected by a 1-in. Tests are being initiated at the present time to determine the life expectancy more closely by irradiating stators in gamma and gamma-neutron fields.

The ultimate solution to the insulation problem is probably the use of ceramic insulation that would be completely radiation-resistant. However, considerably more development work will be required before this type of insulation becomes usable. There are data available which indicate that silicone-resin-bonded reconstituted mica (Isomica, a trademark name of Mica Insulator Co. ) may have better radiation resistance than Fiberglass and silicone varnish. If this material proves to be better from a radiation damage standpoint, it can probably be incorporated into a pump at a much earlier date than the ceramic insulation.

Bearings. The standard Stellite-vs-Graphitar hydrodynamic bearings have indicated little or no wear in pressurized water systems. Presumably, their performance in aqueous homogeneous systems would be comparable if the motor can could be kept in contact with the water only. In practice, bearing life of 13,000+ hr has been achieved in actual contact with uranyl sulfate solutions; however, continuous wear was observed, indicating that eventually the bearing surfaces will fail.

Laboratory tests in water and tests on small pumps in solutions have shown that aluminum oxide bearings and journals have superior wear resistance compared with the Stellite-vs-Graphitar combination.

There is some doubt whether the hydrodynamic-type bearings currently being used will be suitable for long-life slurry pumps. However, preliminary tests of small pumps with aluminum oxide bearings have shown promise. It is also planned to evaluate the performance of hydrostatic (pressurized-fluid) bearings in dilute slurries.

In some cases, excessive wear has occurred in the thrust-bearing leveling linkages of the 400A-type solution and slurry pumps. In this bearing, the thrust load is supported by a linkage system which uses 1/8- and 1/4-inch diameter pins to transfer the load from link to link. It is uncertain whether this wear at the contact point is caused by high stresses or by fretting corrosion.

The general design of slurry pumps is similar to that used for uranyl sulfate pumps. The properties of the slurry are such that only a power correction for the higher specific gravity is necessary in the hydraulic design of the impeller. The coefficient of rigidity (viscosity) is generally not high enough to require a correction to the head-capacity curve. A most severe problem in slurry pumps is the combination of corrosive and erosive attack on the hydraulic parts.

The primary difference in the design of a slurry impeller is the use of radial balancing ribs on the top impeller shroud in place of the top wear ring on a conventional pump. This is done to balance some of the hydraulic thrust and therefore reduce the load on the thrust bearing.

Thrust imbalance causes high thrust-bearing wear. The balancing vanes eliminate one set of wear rings which are subject to high attack rates and also tend to centrifuge the slurry particles to the outside which aids in preventing the slurry from entering the motor through the labyrinth.

On the pumps currently in use, the damage to hydraulic parts is usually limited to the wear rings, the tips of the impeller vanes, and to the volute "cut water," which is the point adjacent to the pump discharge where the volute curve starts. The attack at these points can be reduced by proper material choice and by using the proper design of the flow passages. The best materials that have been found for the hydraulic parts are Zircaloy-2 and titanium, with Zircaloy being better in laboratory corrosion tests. There are no test results for pumps using Zircaloy parts at this time, but vacuum-cast parts have been obtained and placed into service.

The wear rings of the present pumps are being redesigned to provide smooth throttling surfaces rather than the serrated type presently in use. The smooth surfaces should reduce the turbulence and corrosion considerably, with a very small increase in flow through the rings. One service test has shown that the damage to this type of wear ring is decreased considerably. A test is being planned to determine whether radial vanes on the lower impeller shroud, similar to the balancing vanes discussed earlier, will reduce the attack rate on the lower wear rings. The radial vanes will reduce the pressure drop across the wear rings and may reduce the concentration of slurry flowing through them by centrifugal action.

It is uncertain whether a volute-type scroll or a diffuser-type scroll is preferable. The diffuser has numerous points which could be eroded, but the flow around these points should be smoother than that at the cut-water and may not cause excessive damage.

The surface finish on the hydraulic parts is also very critical, and the surface variation should be held to 65 microinches or less. This is especially evident at areas where the impeller surfaces have been ground during the dynamic-balancing operation. If these areas are not properly finished, the scratches will be severely attacked.

Thermal barriers. In pressurized water pumps, the primary function of the thermal barrier is to retard the transmission of heat into the motor. In solution and slurry pumps, another function, that of preventing fluid mixing from pump to motor, is of critical importance.

Outer edge of the barrier: In the 400A pump, the mixing rate at the shaft labyrinth seal has been reduced to 3 cc/hr by redesign of the seal and by the use of a 5-gph purge flow through the motor. Further improvements in shaft seals are being attempted.

Through this joint into the motor. Any small leak was rapidly enlarged by corrosion until excessive motor temperatures were reached. The problem was solved by seal-welding the joint. However, it would have been preferable if the joint had originally been designed for welding.

From a maintenance standpoint, a top-maintenance pump appears to be advantageous. Direct maintenance practices can be used to bolt and unbolt the main flange. The pump casing is a permanent part of the piping system. A top-maintenance pump being developed for the HRE-3 is illustrated in Figure 4.

In a top-mounted pump, a mechanical thermal-barrier joint cannot be avoided since the barrier must be removable from the casing. The joint must be loaded using the top closure bolts, and the entire mechanical system must have some flexibility to compensate for differential thermal expansion of the long motor. A venting system, shown in Figure 4, is used to eliminate the pressure drop across the thermal-barrier gasket so that there will not be significant leakage even if the joint is not perfectly tight. In this case, the purge flow should be effective in preventing leakage of process fluid into the motor.

8-2. 3 Steam generators. The performance of steam generators required for homogeneous reactor service, measured in terms of undetectable leak-tightness during long-term operation, considerably exceeds that of similar units in conventional plants. Unfortunately, no method has yet been developed of remotely locating and repairing leaks in a radioactive heat exchanger without removing the entire unit. Failure of the steam generator in a homogeneous power reactor, therefore, would lead to excessive shutdown time and must be avoided if at all possible.

Heat exchangers used in HRE-2 steam generators rely on careful welding and inspecting of tube-to-tube-sheet joints, as well as extensive thermal-cycle tests carried out prior to actual operation in the reactor. In addition, thermal gradients that would lead to excessive stresses during reactor startup and shutdown are held within specified limits. Although units fabricated for HRE-2 have been tested with advanced inspection methods available for both materials and workmanship and met initial leaktightness specifications, only through operation of the reactor will it be possible to judge the adequacy of these precautions.

Table 8-1 summarizes the steam generators fabricated by the Foster Wheeler Company. In fabricating these steam generators, all-welded construction was used on components that were to be exposed to the process solution. Interpass leakage is controlled by the use of a gold gasket. Considerable attention was given to obtaining the highest quality tubing, which was inspected by ultrasonic and magnetic flaw detectors capable of detecting imperfections as small as 0. 002 in. Following the bending and annealing operations, each tube was inspected for surface defects with a liquid penetrant and subjected to a 4000-psi hydrostatic test. After passing all these tests, the tubes were rolled into the tube sheet and welded by an inert-gas-shielded tungsten-arc process. Quality-control welds were made periodically during the tube-joint welding and were subsequently examined by radiographic and metallographic methods.

After fabrication, the units were subjected to 50 primary-side thermal cycles covering temperature changes more severe than those likely to be encountered in subsequent operation. The units were then helium leak-tested at atmospheric pressure with mass spectrometer equipment capable of detecting leakage lower than 0. 1 cc of helium at STP per day. Leaks were repaired, and the thermal cycle test and leak test were repeated until no leakage was detectable.

The HRE-2 steam generators were thermal cycled with diphenyl as the heating medium. After the test, extensive carbon deposits were found in the tubes. After considerable difficulty, the deposits were removed by high-temperature flushing with oxygenated water and uranyl sulfate solution. Future thermal-cycle tests will be made with steam as the heating medium.

The tube-to-tube-sheet joint is the most damage-sensitive portion of the steam generator. The primary side is subject to corrosive fuels, and the secondary side is subject to crevice corrosion and stress-corrosion cracking. Primary-side corrosion is controlled satisfactorily by maintaining velocities below 15 fps and minimizing high-velocity turbulence in the headers. Secondary-side corrosion is limited by strict control of boiler-water chemistry, particularly chloride content. One method which has been proposed for eliminating the stress-corrosion problem is the use of composite tubing such as stainless steel-Inconel, where the two materials are exposed only to fuel solution and boiler water, respectively.

Another problem in the operation of steam generators in a radioactive environment is the generation of radiolytic oxygen in the boiler water. This oxygen is stripped very rapidly by the steam, which contains about 2 ppm of oxygen. Hydrogen is released at the same time. The corrosivity of this mixture is not yet known, but it can be controlled by the use of inhibitors and by proper selection of materials for use in thin metal sections where pitting attack is undesirable.

HRE-2 spare steam generator. The steam generator shown in -6 was constructed as a possible replacement in case of failure of an HRE-2 steam generator. Although the overall geometry of this unit, fabricated by the Babcock & Wilcox Company, conforms to the space requirements of the present steam generators, the design was changed to minimize the possibility of stress-corrosion cracking of the tubes on the shell side by eliminating crevices in contact with boiler water.

The required length for heat transfer surface. Each tube is brought out through the shell of the exchanger and then all the tubes are collected in the inlet and outlet headers. Thermal sleeves are utilized at every connection of the stainless tubes to the carbon-steel shell wall. Their function is to prevent high thermal stresses in the tubes by distributing the temperature gradient between the shell and tubes along the length of the thermal sleeves. The normal crevice between tubes and tube sheet, which is the site of possible corrosion failures, is eliminated. Each sleeve consists of an austenitic type-347 stainless-steel section which is welded to the tube on one end and to a carbon-steel section of the sleeve on the other.

Large heat exchangers. The Foster Wheeler Corporation has prepared preliminary designs of 50- and 300-MW heat exchangers. Both single-drum integral units and units with separate steam drums were considered in the 50-MW size; only two-drum units were considered in the 300-MW size. Two-drum units, in general, give operational characteristics superior to those of integral units but require more shielded volume and reactor space for installation. The two-drum unit has more stable steam generation at power and provides greater assurance of high steam quality. The major problems introduced by increasing size are higher tube-sheet thermal stress and increased difficulty in the manufacture of large forgings.

The 50-MW design employs approximately 2,200 tubes 3/8 inch in diameter (5,960 ft of heat-transfer area), while the 300-MW design uses approximately 11,400 tubes of the same size (32,000 ft). Most designs have stainless steel clad on steel for tube sheets and heads, and steel for steam shells.

Mechanical pressurization, where pressure is maintained with a pump and relief valve; this system is most satisfactory except that it is difficult to relieve sudden large volume changes following a reactivity change. This system, therefore, has been limited to nonnuclear test loops.

Solution pressurizers. Solution steam pressurizers must satisfy rather strict chemical criteria. Stainless-steel surfaces in contact with solutions must not exceed temperatures at which heavy-liquid-phase solutions form, giving rise to rapid corrosion. Undesirable reduction of uranium must be avoided by the presence of some dissolved oxygen. The vapor-phase concentration of deuterium should be maintained below the explosive limit. One solution to these problems, used in the HRE-2, is the generation of steam from distilled water rather than from fuel solution. Another solution is the boiling of solutions in corrosion-resistant titanium. A third solution is the use of fission-product heating rather than external heating to reach the desired temperature.

Gas pressurizers using O2 gas are attractive from the solution-stability standpoint. Care must be exercised to prevent excessive amounts of dissolved oxygen appearing as bubbles in the circulating reactor stream. This can be accomplished either by continuous letdown of fuel solution or by the use of a mixed steam-gas pressurizer, where gas supplies only a portion of the desired overpressure.

Heat may be supplied to pressurizers by several methods. Electrical heating of pipes, used in the HRE-2, is very convenient but makes control of surface temperature difficult. Heating media such as steam, Dowtherm, liquid metals, etc. , simplify the temperature control problem but introduce costly auxiliaries. Fission-product heating is simple but rather difficult to regulate. Since the heating problem is so complex, the selection of an optimum system for a specific application is quite difficult.

HRE-2 pressurizer. Several design configurations were studied for steam-pressurizing the HRE-2 core system. Both an integral type unit (-7) incorporating a steam generator and fuel surge volume within the same vessel, and a two-unit system utilizing separate steam generator and surge-volume vessels were considered. The basis of both systems was the vaporization of a stream of "clean purge water," pumped from the reactor low-pressure system, to obtain the required steam overpressure.

In determining the internal configuration of the unit, it was necessary to establish a second basic design criterion. Owing to the nature of the system selected, continuous operation of the purge pump is essential to maintaining steam overpressure. Since this type of pump may fail, it was decided that sufficient water should be stored in the steam generator to maintain full operating pressure for at least 1 hr after a purge-pump failure.

A general description of the basic design and system operation follows: The low-pressure condensate, pumped to loop operating pressure by a diaphragm pump, passes through the letdown heat exchanger, where it is preheated to about 280°C, and then enters the lower header of the steam generator, as shown in Figure 7. Clamshell heaters are attached to four pipes inclined upward at 55 degrees. Heat-load calculations indicate that 32 kW are required under rapid-startup load conditions; however, at steady state, the heat load becomes 12. 4 kW. Part of the purge water entering the heater legs (40 lb/hr) is vaporized to provide the desired steam overpressure. The remainder enters a storage pool in the main pressurizer drum. Natural recirculation of this water occurs through two downcomers.

The storage-pool level is maintained constant by allowing excess purge water to be removed through a series of 1/8-inch orifice holes located in the bottom of the tank. An overflow is provided as an additional safety feature in case the orifice holes become plugged. A method of increasing the surge volume, without changing the size of the orifice holes, is to use a larger diameter overflow pipe.

The clamshell heaters are carefully machined to fit the heater pipes and strongly clamped to promote contact. There are eight separate Calrod heaters in each clamshell, so that the failure of a few heater elements will not affect the pressurizer greatly.

Vapor-phase deuterium is kept under control during normal operation by preventing any way for it to enter the pressurizer. If a small amount of gas does enter the pressurizer, it will be dissolved in purge water overflowing into the reactor system; a large amount of gas would be vented.

Slurry pressurizers. The physical problems of slurry pressurizers are similar to those of solution pressurizers. The chemical problems are fortunately not present. The pressurizer may be designed to promote settling of solids so that pure supernatant water is available as a working fluid. It is necessary, however, that the pressurizer be designed to prevent accumulation of cakes or sludges. This is usually accomplished by flowing all or part of the circulating stream through the bottom of the pressurizer. This must be done carefully in steam pressurizers to prevent mixing of cool circulating fluid with the heated pressurizer fluid above.

In the solution or slurry gas pressurizer (b), a jet is used to contact fuel, which contains a liquid-phase catalyst, with pressurizer vapor. This maintains the vapor at a low DE concentration. The high-velocity regions in this system should be constructed of special wear-resistant inserts, such as titanium or zirconium.

The boiling-solution pressurizer (c) has a fuel storage tank where the solution just out of the reactor is heated by its own fission-product decay, and dissolved D2 recombines nearly quantitatively. Additional heating is supplied if necessary by condensing Dowtherm. The mixture of steam and fuel solution is separated; the steam flows into the pressurizer, and the fuel is cooled to a chemically acceptable temperature before re-entering the circulating system. The fuel storage tank, Dowtherm heater, steam separator, and solution cooler are made of titanium. High-strength alloy Ti-110-AT is preferred to commercially pure titanium to increase the strength of these parts.

8-2. 5 Piping and welded joints. The various codes dealing with pressure piping have proved very satisfactory for determining the strength required for reactor piping. Pipes are sized on the basis of experimentally determined maximum velocities for low corrosion and/or erosion rates. The austenitic stainless steels are used for most piping applications.

Because the piping system of a homogeneous reactor must be absolutely leak-tight throughout its service life, care is exercised in selecting pipe of the highest obtainable quality. The chemical composition and corrosion resistance are checked. Rigid cleanliness is maintained during fabrication to prevent undesirable contaminants.

The design of solution piping systems must eliminate stagnant lines where oxygen depletion may cause solution instability and plugging. Slurry piping systems should be designed to prevent settling, which can cause plugging or make decontamination very difficult.

Equipment must be located where it will be accessible for maintenance, and the piping adjacent to such equipment must be placed so that it can be disconnected and reassembled remotely. These requirements may result in a piping system of excessive length with resultant high fluid holdup and pressure drop. The final design, therefore, must be a compromise between the various conflicting requirements of flexibility, maintenance, holdup, and pressure loss in the line.

Methods of piping analysis and evaluation as presented by Hanson and Jahsman may be used for analyzing the piping layouts in homogeneous reactor systems. An application of the Kellogg method was used by Lundin to analyze stresses in the HRE-2 system.

Welded joints are recommended for reactor piping over mechanical joints because welds provide equal strength and corrosion resistance to the base metal. Pipe and fittings are designed to utilize full-penetration butt welds throughout the piping system; this ensures that there are no crevices present in areas where process fluids will contact the weld. Inspections of these welds are conducted thoroughly to ensure that penetration is complete and that there are no defects that could lead to crevice corrosion and leaks.

The first 1/8 in. on the process side is deposited by use of bare-wire filler metal and inert tungsten-arc welding techniques. The ferrite content of the deposit is controlled to minimize the possibility of cracking. This deposit is inspected visually and with penetrant. If the weld thus far contains any defects, they are removed by grinding or other means before proceeding with the next step. The remaining 1/8 in. The final 1/8 in.

No visible defects, it is radiographed to ensure freedom from all defects. The balance of the weld is then deposited from either bare or coated wire. The completed weld is inspected again with dye penetrant and radiography. A small number of inclusions or porosity are permitted in the final layers which contact air.

Although welding techniques for clean piping are very satisfactory, remote welding procedures for repair of contaminated reactor systems are only in the development stage. It is desirable to develop methods for remote cutting, positioning, welding, and inspection of joints, particularly in large pipes. Possession of these techniques would greatly increase the maintainability of circulating fuel reactors.

Remotely welding pipe has not yet been developed; equipment, which must be removable from the system for replacement or maintenance, must be connected to the system with mechanical joints. Several types of mechanical joints applicable to pressure systems have been described in the literature, but most have been eliminated from consideration for homogeneous reactor service because their reliability with respect to leaktightness following thermal cycling has not been adequately demonstrated.

Welding-neck flanges and ring-joint gaskets, as described in ASA Standard B16. 20-1956, were used in the HRE-2 and are considered to be the most reliable closure for reactor piping systems to date. Since there are two sealing surfaces in this type of joint, it is ideal for leak-detector purge systems described below, which prevent even minute leakage of contaminated fluids into the shield.

To enforce proper dimensions for HRE-2 gaskets and grooves, special master rings and grooves were manufactured to measure dimensions to acceptable tolerances. It was convenient to obtain manufacturing tolerances that permitted greater accuracy in fit-up and assured uniform contact between the ring-joint gasket and the grooves of both mating flanges. Soft oval or octagonal type-304 ELC stainless steel rings are used.

The bolting of flanged joints presents a serious problem because the bolts, under thermal cycling, loosen up after only a very few cycles, thus threatening the integrity of the joint. Whereas the flange bolts of a conventional pressure piping system may be retightened after a few cycles, this becomes impractical in a homogeneous reactor system after the reactor has gone critical. In the HRE-2, it was found desirable to initially stress the low-alloy steel flange bolts to an average loading of 45,000 psi, as indicated by a torque wrench. After about three thermal cycles, this bolt loading fell to an asymptotic value of approximately 30,000 psi, which was found to be adequate to maintain the integrity of the joint indefinitely throughout further operations. No retightening of the bolts was found to be necessary. Some deformation of flange grooves and ring-joint gaskets was found as a result of these high loadings. However, with the use of flanges and rings machined to the close tolerances noted above, there was no leakage even after test joints had been opened and reassembled ten to a hundred times.

Although bolt torque measurements are usually considered very approximate indications of load, special techniques were developed that gave reproducibility to within +10%. Bolts were lubricated with molybdenum sulfide, and nuts were tightened several times against test blocks, which approximated the flange spacing. Nut-and-bolt combinations were accepted for use after reproducible compressive stresses were produced in the test blocks for given torques.

Bolts may be loaded more precisely with the use of pin extensometers. In this technique, a pin is spot-welded into one end of a hole drilled axially through the bolt centerline. A depth gauge measures quite precisely the amount of extension or compression of the bolt under load.

Because mechanical joints may be expected to leak, some provision must be made to supply pressure greater than the reactor system pressure to the undersides of the ring-joint grooves. By this means, leaks may be detected by observations of a drop in pressure in the auxiliary system. At the same time, inleakage of a nonradioactive fluid to the reactor system in the event of a leak prevents radioactive spills. In the case of the HRE-2, D20 is supplied to the sealed annuli formed in the gasket grooves at a pressure approximately 500 psi greater than that in the reactor system. A hole is drilled through one flange at each pipe joint to the annulus of the ring groove; the ring-joint gasket is also drilled to interconnect the annuli of the two flanges. Heavy-wall, 1/4-in. -OD stainless-steel tubing connects each flange pair with a header and pressurizer in the control area. ORNL experience has indicated that water is more satisfactory as a leak-detector fluid than gas because its pressure change is a more sensitive leak indication and because its surface tension reduces the magnitude of small leaks.

Vickers-Anderson joints. From a remote-maintenance point of view, a flange requiring as few bolts as possible is desirable. Adaptation of the Vickers-Anderson type closure appears to be a possible approach to the problem, since it obtains uniform circumferential tightening with only two bolts. In this type of joint, two split clamshell pieces are pressed together with the two bolts. The clamshells bear on conical flange faces, which transform the tangential bolt forces into forces parallel with the axis of the bolt holes.

Usually, a pressure-seal type of gasket is used with the above type of closure because it is difficult to exert sufficient axial load to seat a ring-joint gasket. Unfortunately, the present leak detector concept is not applicable to such a gasket.

Bi-metallic joints. A two-region reactor may have the problem of obtaining a leak-tight low differential pressure mechanical joint between the two regions. In the HRE-2, the regions are separated by a zirconium vessel that must be joined to stainless-steel piping. At this time, welding and brazing techniques for joining the two materials are unsatisfactory. Conventional flanges are not satisfactory because of the large difference in thermal coefficients of expansion for the two materials. A solution to the problem for the HRE-2 was obtained by using a titanium cylindrical bi-metallic joint.

Sleeve gasket with gold inserts for sealing, shown in -10. The gasket, which consists of four concentric rings, flexes radially to absorb thermal expansion. The gold-capped surfaces of the gasket that make the seal are not permitted to rotate or slide relative to the flanges. The joint is loaded with titanium-alloy bolts.

A ring joint for connecting stainless steel and titanium piping at temperatures up to 650°F has also been developed for possible use with a titanium letdown heat exchanger in the HRE-2. The different thermal coefficients of expansion of the two materials are bridged by the use of a stainless-steel clad carbon-steel flange in the stainless half of the joint. An HRE type of leak detector is placed in the clad flange.

8-2. 7 Gas separators. The problem of removing relatively small amounts of gas from a stream of liquid is usually solved by using a settling tank, which permits bubbles of gas to rise to a free surface. In applications in which the amount of liquid holdup is critical, this approach has the serious drawback of requiring too much liquid. However, a chamber which imparts centrifugal force to the liquid and “forces the gas to a free surface before the liquid leaves the chamber offers a possible solution. Of the several types of separators which can be used, one of the most promising is the pipeline or axial gas separator (-11) used in the HRE-2.

A model of the gas separator was built, and runs were made to test vanes and volutes of different types for energy conversion and recovery, and for gas removal efficiency. It was found possible to control the size of the gas void by design of the takeoff nozzle. A separator utilizing vanes was selected for the HRE-2 on the basis of ease of fabrication and because high-efficiency recovery vanes could be designed. Titanium was used as a construction material because of its excellent corrosion resistance under highly turbulent conditions.

Pressure distribution: The pressure drop of the liquid stream through a well-designed gas separator can be approximated by assuming an efficiency of conversion of pressure to velocity in the rotation system of 90% and a recovery efficiency of 80%. Frictional drop in the vortex will be about three times that which would be predicted if the absolute velocity of the vortex near the wall were in axial flow. The ΔP across the HRE-2 separator is five inlet-velocity heads or 5 psi.

Length of separator: The length is typically chosen to ensure the bubble travels from the periphery to the central void while moving axially through the separator. Approximately two pipe diameters are needed for the HRE-2 separator; however, larger separators exhibit an increased length-to-diameter ratio.

Vortex stability. The degree of rotation for stable operation is such that the centrifugal forces on a bubble are greater than the gravitational forces. The dimensionless group expressing the ratio of these forces is V:/Vgr, where V is tangential velocity (ft/sec), g is 32. 2 ft/sec, and r is radius (ft). For a stable vortex, this ratio must be greater than 1. For best results, it should be greater than 4.

Nozzle. It is advantageous to have a high stability number. The nozzle should be paraboloid facing the stream and have a small takeoff port. Tests of the HRE-2 separator indicate that entrainment can be limited to 0. 1 gpm at liquid and gas throughputs of 400 gpm and 4 gpm, respectively. Tests of a 5000-gpm separator with 2% gas gave 1 gpm of liquid entrainment, minimum.

Although gas has been removed from slurries in an axial separator, the design criteria are not known. The primary difficulty lies in the interaction between small solid particles and bubbles, which may foam. The rates of bubble rise in slurries have not been measured.

To keep the fuel solution well mixed, it was desired that the solution be agitated by recirculation through the tank at a high rate. The recirculation rate is such that the frictional loss in the vaporizing circuit is equal to the hydrostatic driving force on the vaporizing fluid. For the HRE-2 evaporator, a ratio of 176 lb of liquid circulating for every pound of steam generated was obtained.

Slurry storage tanks. Three approaches are being pursued in the development of slurry drain and storage tanks for reactor use: mechanically agitated tanks, agitation by steam-sparging the tank, and agitation by surface boiling and consequent vapor transport through the tank.

The development of a mechanically agitated tank addresses the challenges associated with acquiring the required reactor-grade mechanical components such as motors, seals, drive shafts, bearings, and agitators. These issues are interconnected with the circulating pump challenges that have been previously examined. A conceptual design of a mechanically agitated tank, as proposed by Westinghouse, is illustrated in Figure 12(a).

8-3. 2 Entrainment separator. From the results of a literature survey and from experimental work, the separator in -13 was designed for the HRE-2.

The HRE-2 design incorporates three modes of entrainment removal: centrifugal separation, corrugated plates, and wire-mesh demister elements. The centrifugal-flow inlet and corrugated plates precede the wire mesh and remove the main portion of the liquid and the larger particles of entrained moisture in the letdown from the gas separator. The wire mesh also serves to keep the uranium reaching the recombiner below the maximum desirable limit of 1 ppm.

8-3. 3 Recombiners. For safety as well as economic reasons, it is desirable to recombine, either at high pressure or at low pressure, the H2 and O2 which are formed by the decomposition of water in the fuel solution. In the HRE-2, only low-pressure recombination has been used effectively.

For the catalytic combination of Dz and Oz, platinum black has proved to be the most satisfactory catalyst. It has been supported on alumina pellets and on stainless steel wire mesh. The platinum adheres better to the alumina pellets, but the wire mesh is less liable to mechanical damage.

Design of the catalytic recombiners. The space-velocity method is a very convenient basis for recombiner design. Space velocity is defined as the cubic feet of gas-vapor mixture fed (STP) per cubic foot of catalyst bed per hour. The maximum allowable space velocity for 100% recombination is approximately 4. 2 x 10^5 hr-1 at atmospheric pressure. However, the packed bed should be shaped to ensure against channeling and to get a low pressure drop. inside diameter and 93-in. outside diameter.

The controlling mechanisms for catalytic reaction rates are outlined by Hougen and Watson. One of the important steps is the mass transfer of the reactant gases to the catalytic surface. Most of the homogeneous reactor recombination work at ORNL has been done in the range controlled by mass transfer, at temperatures of 250 to 500°C.

However, experiments conducted at 50 psi indicated lower mass-transfer coefficients than expected based on established mass-transfer correlations. This is explained by poor bed configuration, channeling, and entrance and exit effects. Tests run at 500 and 1000 psi have shown values about 60% of the theoretical.

Flame recombiners. In a flame recombiner, the H₂ (or D₂) and O₂ are actually ignited and burned to form water. The HRE-1 recombiner was of this type. It consisted of a combustion chamber of 10-in. pipe 33 ft long jacketed by a 12-in. pipe through which cooling water was circulated. The combustible mixture of H₂ and O₂ was introduced through a many-holed nozzle upon which a spark impinged from two spark plugs located along the periphery of the nozzle. The spark impulse was produced by a magnet, with an ignition transformer on standby. The cooling water removed 70% of the heat of combustion at the design capacity of 15 scfm of 2H₂+ O₂. The remainder of the heat was removed in the after-condenser. The condensed products of combustion were returned by gravity to the dump tanks, and the excess O₂ and fission-product gases were passed into the off-gas system to the cold traps and charcoal adsorbers.

Natural-circulation recombiner. For some applications, it may be desirable to have a catalytic recombiner that will operate satisfactorily without a pump or evaporator to circulate diluent to keep the gases below the explosive limit. Electric heaters or steam coils installed below the catalyst start the circulation of the diluent and keep the catalyst dry. A cooling coil located in the annular space around the top of the chimney completes the convective driving circuit.

High-pressure recombination.

Recombination rates were quite satisfactory. However, stress-corrosion cracking was a significant problem in operating the stainless-steel loop. Originally, the chloride content of the loop was high (50 ppm) and was thought to be the cause of the stress corrosion. However, after the chloride concentration was lowered to less than 1 ppm, stress corrosion still occurred in the superheated region of the loop. It was established that entrained caustic was a contributing factor.

The cracking problem was solved by substituting Inconel for austenitic steel, which would be suitable in a slurry reactor system but not in a uranyl-sulfate system. One of the ferritic stainless steels might be suitable for the latter application.

8-3. 4 Condenser. A condenser is required in aqueous low-pressure systems: (1) to condense the steam produced in the storage tank-evaporator, which is a source of distilled water; (2) to remove the heat of recombination; and (3) to cool the reactor contents during and after an emergency drain.

All stainless-steel shell-and-tube condensers of conventional design have been used in this application. The quality of construction from the standpoint of leaktightness should approach that of the main steam generators. However, since the service conditions in the condenser are relatively mild, its life should be indefinite if it passes acceptance tests. The condenser used in the HRE-2 is illustrated in Figure 14.

The cold traps may be refrigerated either by a direct-expansion system or by circulation of a chilled secondary fluid. The secondary type system offers advantages of eliminating the expansion valve from the shielded area and simpler defrosting procedures when using a warm supply of the secondary refrigerant. Use of a primary system eliminates the heat exchanger and circulating pump and sacrifices about 10°F temperature difference needed in the heat exchanger, thus affording slightly better coefficients of performance for the refrigeration system.

The HRE-2 cold traps are double-pipe stainless-steel heat exchangers. The flow of refrigerant is countercurrent, with the traps pitched to drain the D2O when defrosting. The insulation is in the form of sealed cans of Santo-Cel (SiO2) fitted around the traps; this material has markedly better resistance to radiation damage than the more commonly used low-temperature insulating materials. Cold traps are used in pairs so that icing and defrosting can be conducted simultaneously.

The major heat load on the HRE-2 cold traps was estimated to be the internal heat generation due to radioactivity in the off-gases. For the double-pipe design selected, increasing the heat-transfer surface also increases the mass of metal and the heat generation, so that the size must be optimized. Overall heat-transfer coefficients in the HRE-2 cold traps, using Amsco as the secondary refrigerant, were calculated to be in the range of 30 to 35 Btu/(hr)(ft)(°F). Velocities of the gas stream were kept quite low, less than 5 fpm. Design velocities of the chilled coolant through the annulus were from 1 to 2 fps.

8-3. 6 Charcoal adsorbers. The oxygen off-gas from a homogeneous reactor contains the krypton and xenon fission products, which are let down with the radiolytic gas. It is desired to discharge the oxygen to the atmosphere, but the permissible rare-gas discharge is limited by health physics considerations. Charcoal adsorbers are used to hold up krypton and xenon sufficiently to permit their decay to stable or slightly radioactive daughters.

The HRE-2 charcoal beds were designed on the basis of adsorption equilibrium data of krypton and xenon from the literature, with a safety factor of six to compensate for the lack of experimental data on such beds immersed in a water-cooled underground concrete tank. In the HRE-1, 13. 9 ft of charcoal were used for a design flow rate of 470 ce/min. The HRE-1 beds operated successfully.

8-3. 7 Feed pumps. High-pressure low-capacity pumps are required to feed solutions, slurries, and water into aqueous homogeneous reactor systems. In the HRE-2, which operates at 2000 psi, the requirements are for from 0 to 1. 5 gpm of fuel solution, 0. 25 gpm of purge water to the pressurizer, and 0.

The types of pumps which could possibly be made to meet these requirements are the piston or plunger pump, the multistage centrifugal pump, the turbine regenerative pump, and the hydraulically actuated diaphragm pump. The piston and plunger pumps are handicapped because most packing materials are subject to radiation damage and because there is no absolutely leakproof sliding seal. There is no known commercial centrifugal pump available in this high-head, low-capacity range, and the development of such a pump appears difficult. The regenerative turbine pump has a more suitable head-capacity range, but again there is no existing multistage pump in the range desired. The hydraulically driven diaphragm pump, as shown in -16, was selected for the HRE-2 because it offers the following advantages: 1. It has a high degree of reliability and maintainability due to its simple design and few moving parts. 2. It is capable of handling a wide range of fluids including water, steam, air, hydrocarbons, and corrosive liquids. 3. It can be operated in either direction, which allows for the use of only one pump per system. 4. It has a low noise level due to its diaphragm construction. 5. It is compact and lightweight, making it suitable for installation in small spaces.

Construction. The HRE-2 duplex feed pump consists of three main components: the drive unit, the pulsator assembly, and the diaphragm heads. The drive unit and pulsator assembly are commercial products built by Scott & Williams, Inc. The drive unit consists of a high-pressure positive-displacement oil pump and a slide valve, which alternately supplies oil to one pulsator and then the other at 78 strokes/min. While one pulsator is being supplied with oil from the pump, the other is being vented back to the oil reservoir tank. During this venting period, the elasticity of the rubber pulsator forces the oil back to the tank and provides the energy for the suction stroke of the diaphragm head. Reciprocating oil pumps are used to drive smaller purge pumps on the HRE-2. The oil pulses are transferred to the diaphragm head by the column of D20 filling the intermediate system (-16).

The diaphragm head consists of a stainless steel diaphragm 0. 031 in. thick operating between two heavy flanges, which have carefully machined diaphragm cavities. The pumped fluid enters the pump through a 3/4-in. pipe, passes up through the screen tube, and oscillates in and out of the diaphragm cavity through rows of holes in the contoured surface of the flange. The driving and pumping flanges are identical except that the driving flange has only the top pipe connection since the actuating column of D2O needs only to oscillate. The screen tube is self-cleaning since the flow through it is oscillating. The two flanges are clamped rigidly together by means of heavy girth welds, which become highly stressed because of shrinkage during fabrication.

The pump is equipped with all-welded, double-ball, gravity-operated suction, and discharge check valves. The 1-inch balls operate in close-fitting cages (0. 010-inch diametral clearance), which maintain the alignment of the ball and seat and restrict the ball lift to 0. 125 inches.

Operation: The pump output can be varied from 0 to 2 gpm at 2000 psi discharge pressure by changing either speed or displacement of the drive. The pump performance is essentially independent of suction head and temperature, so long as cavitation does not occur.

To obtain proper operation of the pump, the amount of water in the intermediate system between the rubber pulsator and the diaphragm must be adjusted to ensure that the diaphragm does not bottom solidly against either contoured face of the head. This procedure, called phasing, is accomplished manually by adding or venting water as required through the phasing system shown in Fig. 16.

Fairly wide range of phasing in which the pump will operate properly, since only one-third of the displacement volume in the head is used.

The volume between the check valves is large compared with the volume of the stroke, so that the pump is subject to gas-binding. An operational error or a leaking discharge check valve that permits oxygenated solution to flow back into the pump may inject sufficient gas so that the head will not resume pumping against a high discharge pressure. A method of venting the gas must, therefore, be provided.

Deep, annealed stainless Type-347 diaphragm with no screening suffered early failure due to irregular contour machining and dents caused by the trapping of dirt particles between the contour face and the diaphragm. To reduce the overall diaphragm stress level and to reduce or eliminate localized stress risers, the contour depth was reduced to 0. 010 in. , the machining procedure was changed to produce a smooth, continuous contour, and 40-mesh screens were installed. These changes increased the average diaphragm life to about four and a half months. However, some failures occurred in as little as two months. An intensive program was initiated to develop a head that would function consistently for one year or more.

The first objective of the program was to reduce or eliminate stress risers caused by dirt particles. Substitution of 100-mesh screen tubes for the 40-mesh screens reduced denting observed on test diaphragms by an order of magnitude. A sintered stainless-steel porous tube with 20-micron openings is being evaluated at the present time in an experimental pump to reduce the problem further.

A second objective was to investigate possible improvements in contour in order to minimize diaphragm stress for the desired volumetric displacement. Theoretical and experimental stress analyses showed that the original contour was nearly optimum, and it was retained.

A third objective was to determine the nature of the diaphragm motion and improve it if necessary. A special spring-loaded magnetic instrument was built to indicate diaphragm position while operating. Three such indicators were installed in a standard head and recorded simultaneously on a fast multichannel instrument. It was observed that the diaphragm was displaced in a wave motion starting at the top of the head, producing a sharp bend at the bottom where most failures occurred. It was observed also that there was considerable flutter in the diaphragm, so that it was being flexed more frequently than anticipated.

The fourth point of the program involved determining the endurance limit of annealed 347 stainless steel and other possible diaphragm materials in fuel solution. A literature review indicated that in a corrosive environment, there may be no endurance limit as such, but that the curve of stress versus the number of cycles would continue its downward slope indefinitely. Standard reverse bending sheet specimens of each material were operated at 2000 cycles/min in environments of air, distilled water, and fuel solution. Surprisingly, it was found that hardened materials suffered a drastic reduction in the endurance limit in the fuel solution but not in water, whereas the annealed psi, respectively, in air, water, and fuel. None of these media produce appreciable corrosive attack on any of the materials tested.

Check-valve materials. Stellite balls and seats have been operated in fuel solutions for more than 10,000 hours with no sign of damage. It was rather surprising when, during preoperational testing of the HRE-2, four sets of valves failed in oxygenated distilled water in about 500 hours. Further testing showed that preconditioning by operation in uranyl sulfate made Stellite suitable for oxygenated-water use.

HRE-2 fuel pumps now contain Stellite Star J balls and Stellite No. 3 seats. Check valves are pre-run in the fuel solution before being welded to the pump heads.

Welding. Considerable difficulty has been experienced in the design of welds subject to cyclic pressure stresses. Extreme conservatism with regard to metal thickness is helpful in eliminating fatigue failure of welds. Nozzles welded to pump heads have heavy sections at the weld. Full-penetration welds are used throughout, and butt welds are used if possible. The inside surfaces of welds are machined smooth when they are accessible.

Sizing the vertical leg so as to maintain low oscillatory velocities, a stable slurry-water interface forms, permitting the diaphragm head to operate in relatively pure water while slurry pumps through the check valves. A venting system is necessary. Such a pump has been operated satisfactorily at low pressure and will be tested at high pressure.

The second method uses a diaphragm head having a contoured driving flange, a recessed cavity in the pumping flange, and an arrangement that permits the diaphragm to operate only from the driving contour to center. This arrangement precludes the possibility of slurry being trapped between the diaphragm and contour, leading to undesirable diaphragm deflection patterns. Such a pump head has been built and will be tested.

8-3. 8 Valves. Valves are key components in reactor systems, since they are the means by which process gas and liquid streams are controlled. In the HRE-2 system, which has no control rods, temperature and reactivity are controlled by valves that control the concentration of the fuel solution, and the power is controlled by valves that control the rate of steam removal from the heat exchangers. Dump valves perform an emergency scram and normal drain function by controlling the flow of fuel solution to low-pressure storage tanks. Other valves perform pressure control functions, allow noncondensable gases to be bled from the system, or are used to isolate equipment.

Actuators. The problem of radiation damage to hydraulic fluids, elastomers, or electrical insulations is avoided by utilizing pneumatically powered metallic bellows for remote actuation of the valves. The actuator is a simple linear device which can be controlled with standard pneumatic controllers or regulators. The bellows may also be stacked to multiply the forces available. In the HRE-2, pneumatic actuators develop up to 5440 lbs of force.

An actuator capable of developing a thrust of about 12,000 lb was cycled four times per minute at a stroke of 1/2 in. and a pressure of 80 psig for 265,000 cycles before developing a small leak in the stem sealing bellows. Two or three bellows-spring assemblies from these units have been attached to a common shaft and connected in parallel to a source of air pressure in preliminary tests of an even more powerful actuator.

Valve designs used in HRE-2. The valve designs used on the HRE-2 are all quite similar. Figure 8-17(a) illustrates the "letdown valve," which is typical. This valve throttles a mixture of cooled gas and liquid from the 2000-psi high-pressure system to the low-pressure storage tanks. The flow is introduced under the seat to keep the bellows on the low-pressure side of the valve from being overstressed by the pressure drop across the valve.

Side of the throttling orifice and thus under less strain. A seat integral with the valve body is used to avoid the difficult problem of leakage around removable seats. Stellite No. 6 and type 17-4 PH stainless steel plugs have been used, since these very hard materials are corrosion-resistant in uranyl sulfate solutions below 100°C and resist erosion due to flow impingement. Bellows seal assembly is in two sections, welded together, because the bellows length needed for the 1/2-in. stroke cannot be manufactured in a single section at this time. An average bellows life of 50,000 5/8-in. strokes has been obtained at 500 psi with this assembly. The stem is of hexagonal stock and fits in a similarly shaped guide to prevent torque from being applied to the bellows. The leak-detecting tap between the bellows and the secondary graphited-asbestos packing seal affords a means of detecting a bellows leak, while the asbestos gland prevents gross leakage of process fluid in case of bellows failure.

The valve, which was supplied by the Fulton Sylphon Division of Robertshaw-Fulton Controls Corporation, is rated for 2500-psi service with the flow introduced under the seat. However, the downstream pressure is limited. The reversible-action operator, supplied by The Annin Company, has a 50-in effective area. It is rated for a maximum of 60 psi air operating pressure. The action illustrated is spring-closed, air-to-open; however, by a simple interchange of parts, the actuator operation can be reversed. The actuating bellows is made from type-321 stainless steel and was formed by the Stainless Steel Products Company. The stem guide bushing is made from hardened tool steel.

The only two process valves in the HRE-2, which operate with full system pressure on the bellows seal, are those used to isolate the reactor from the chemical plant. The bellows used here, supplied by FultonSylphon, are rated at 2000 psi and 300°C.

The low-pressure HRE-2 valves are novel in that ring-joint grooves are integral with the valve body, as illustrated in Figure 17(b). Long bolts at the corners of the valve body hold the companion flanges, making the valve replaceable with the disassembly of only one set of bolts.

In slurry service, metallic trim, such as those above, have been satisfactory for low-pressure valves but unsatisfactory for long life in high-pressure service. Ceramic materials appear promising, but little experience has been obtained to date.

A gold-gasketed valve has been developed for tight shutoff of gases. The gasket is placed into a groove machined in the valve plug, which mates with a tongue machined into the seat. This type of trim has also given excellent results in one hot uranyl-sulfate loop application.

Slurry service valves. In addition to the erosiveness of slurries, other problems are introduced by their tendency to settle out in the primary bellows seal or at stem guiding surfaces, thus interfering with valve action. This may be avoided by purging slurry from the bellows compartment with distilled water.

Special gas-metering valve: An ORNL-developed differential thermoexpansion metering valve is utilized to regulate the flow of oxygen gas to the HRE-2 high-pressure system. The required flow is very small and is difficult to control by conventional mechanical positioning methods. The valve shown in -18 utilizes the difference in thermal coefficient of expansion of tantalum and stainless steel to effect flow control. The tantalum plug is used to avoid any possibility of an ignition reaction between the oxygen gas and the metal, the temperature of which for a flow of 2000 std. cc/min with a 400 psi differential can reach 300°C. The design incorporates all-welded construction and is covered with a waterproof protective housing. The resistance heating element and thermocouple are duplicated to ensure continuity of service.

8-3. 9 Sampling equipment. Operation of an aqueous homogeneous reactor requires that numerous samples be taken in maintaining control of the chemical composition of the solutions. Because of the radioactivity associated with these fluids, standard sampling equipment must be modified or entirely new apparatus must be devised for taking the samples.

Samples of liquid and suspended solids will be taken from the high- and low-pressure systems of the HRE-2. Solution from the high-pressure system is reduced in temperature and pressure from 300°C and 2000 psi to approximately 80°C and 1 atm by a cooler and throttling valve before being directed to a filter press for dewatering.

Figure 8-19(a) shows the general assembly of the sampling facility. Virtually all the mechanism is suspended from a shield plug. Personnel shielding is provided by a 2-ft depth of lead shot and water in the plug. The loading tube is sealed by a plug valve to maintain a slight vacuum in the housing. Threaded backup rods extending through the plug are employed to adjust the position of the sample collector.

Employed to make the final connections with reactor piping after the plug assembly is lowered into its housing. Each sampling facility contains two isolation chambers: one for isolating samples from the high-pressure system and the other for obtaining samples from the low-pressure system.

When a sample is being taken, solution from the desired system is allowed to flow through its isolation chamber until a representative sample is obtained. The isolation chamber is then valved off. An evacuated sample flask is placed in the holder and lowered through the loading tube to the transfer mechanism. The assembly is then indexed under the proper isolation chamber, where the flask holder is raised by an air cylinder until contact is made between the isolation-chamber nozzle and the inverse cone of the carrier head (19b). Further lifting of the flask holder causes the hypodermic needle to puncture the rubber diaphragm. The sample is then discharged into the flask by opening the valve on the chamber. When the sample is in the flask, the procedures are reversed, and the flask holder is removed into a shielded carrier for transport to the analytical laboratory.

A third sampling station for the HRE-2, identical to the fuel and blanket facilities except for larger passages and a modified isolation chamber, is employed for sampling a fuel stream in the chemical processing facility. This stream has the order of 50 times the solids concentration of the other streams being sampled.

The unique feature of the design deals with the flow geometry of the letdown stream. To promote efficient flow of the two-phase mixture through the letdown valve, it is necessary to prevent flow separation of the two phases. This is done by utilizing the annulus of the exchanger, with weld-bead spacers every 3 in. to promote turbulence.

During the transit from reactor operating temperature to 100°C in the letdown heat exchanger, fuel solution must go through the temperature range 175 to 225°C, at which stainless-steel corrosion resistance passes through a minimum. This suggests that after several years, leakage would occur between the feed and letdown streams. This problem can be circumvented by the substitution of titanium for stainless steel.

8-3. 11 Freeze plugs. Several reactor installations have employed freeze plugs on liquid-carrying process lines to assure absolute leaktight shutoff. Lines up to 4 in. in diameter have been frozen with a simple wrap-around coil of copper tubing when there was no flow in the pipe other than the convective currents set up by the freezing process. It is conceivable that leaktightness in very large lines might be achieved by refrigerating the passages of valves to freeze a relatively small amount of liquid at the valve seat. This freezing technique is most helpful in reducing the spread of contamination during maintenance.

The most efficient freeze-jacket design is one which provides an annular space around the process pipe and allows direct contact of the refrigerant with the pipe. This is generally considered undesirable, however, from the standpoint that if process fluid should leak into the refrigerant, activity would be carried outside the shielded area. Tubing 5/16 inches in diameter has been used on 1/4- to 1/2-inch standard pipe up to 4 inches. Clamp-on, or clamshell, types of freeze jackets were developed for the HRE-2 for temporarily freezing certain lines.

Freezing times of a few minutes for 1/2-inch and smaller lines and up to several hours for 3- and 4-inch sizes have been observed when the refrigerant temperature is in the -20 to -40°F range and with flows through the jacket of 3 to 5 gpm. Insulation outside the freeze jacket materially aids in the ability to freeze lines with particularly high heat load, such as those subjected to gamma heating.

A two-stage primary mechanical refrigeration system is employed in the HRE-2. Refrigerants commonly used in such a system are the halogenated hydrocarbons, provided that the primary refrigerant remains outside the reactor shield. Breakdown of this series of refrigerants under radiation has been observed to have the serious effects of forming phosgene gas and insoluble tarry polymers; thus, creating conditions corrosive to stainless steel. Carbon dioxide is probably the best refrigerant for use in an irradiated direct-expansion system, but it must be used at high pressure.

Choice of a secondary refrigerant to be circulated through radioactive equipment is difficult because it must meet several desirable properties such as having a low freezing point, suitable viscosity, low vapor pressure, non-corrosiveness, non-toxicity, and non-flammability. In addition, the fluid should also be resistant to radiation damage, not contain chloride ions which might promote stress-corrosion cracking of stainless steels, and not evaporate to insoluble residues. Miscibility with water would be advantageous if underwater maintenance techniques are employed, in that if some refrigerant escapes, there is less impairment of vision and a film is not left on equipment when the water is drained.

In addition to the primary refrigeration system used to maintain a central supply of chilled Amsco, it was useful for short-term maintenance operations at the HRE-2 to have also a portable rig, consisting of an insulated tank and circulating pump. Chilling was accomplished by floating blocks of CO2 ice directly in the liquid secondary refrigerant; temperatures of about -75°F were maintained with a circulation rate of about 4 gpm and with an ice consumption rate of 75 to 100 lb/hr.

8-4. 2 Oxygen injection equipment. Oxygen is needed in the high-pressure fuel system to maintain the chemical stability of the uranyl-sulfate solution and to reduce corrosion of the stainless steel container. This oxygen is injected into the fuel system through a small nozzle located near the top of the fuel element.

Gen may be introduced most conveniently into the fuel feed stream at either the suction or discharge of the feed pump. As a result of operational experience, high-pressure injection has been found to be more flexible and to give better feed pump performance.

The oxygen system requires a high-pressure gas supply and a metering device. The first supply used in the HRE-2 was a converter-manufactured compressor may be desirable to recirculate contaminated oxygen and is being investigated. Metering is accomplished with a thermal valve (described earlier) controlled by a capillary flowmeter.

Oxygen converter. The HRE-2 oxygen generator is designed to convert liquid oxygen to the gaseous state and deliver it to the fuel and blanket high-pressure systems at pressures up to 3000 psig. The capacity of the generator is 0. 47 ft³, or 30 lb of oxygen, when 90% filled with liquid. This will permit delivery of approximately 21 lb of oxygen gas at 3000 psig and 70°F.

Oxygen compressors: High-pressure, low-capacity laboratory-type oxygen compressors have recently become commercially available. Pressure Products Industries of Hatboro, PA produces a compressor with a stainless-steel diaphragm hydraulically actuated in a contoured chamber by a reciprocating drive. A single-stage machine capable of compressing approximately 0. 8 scfm of O2 from 500 psi to 2500 psi has been purchased and placed in service in the HRT mockup. Despite some difficulties with the hydraulic plunger packing, it has been generally satisfactory.

The instrumentation and control systems for aqueous homogeneous reactors are similar to those used in modern high-pressure steam power and chemical plants, but with some significant differences due to the unique requirements of nuclear reactor operation. While problems attendant on radiation damage to insulations, the difficulty of performing maintenance or replacement operations, and the requirement for absolute leaktightness and very high reliability of components necessary for safety and plant operability have required considerable development of special components, the basic principles of instrumentation and controls remain similar to those used in other process industries.

Electric. Advantages for electric transmission under these conditions include the ease of readjusting system zeros and spans from the control room and the ability to sense motion from weld-sealed transmitters without the use of flexure seals, such as bellows and torque tubes. The speed of information transmission, the ease of switching signals, and the ability of the sensing elements to operate over wide temperature ranges may also be important. Disadvantages of the electrical system include the possible radiation damage to insulations and the present unavailability of a cheap, reliable linear power actuator for control valves.

Pneumatic. Advantages of a pneumatic system include utilization of all-metallic radiation-resistant construction for transmitters and valve actuators by use of metallic bellows, bourdon tubes, and convoluted diaphragms. The advantages of high state of commercial development, low cost, reliability, miniaturization, and ease of paralleling of receiving elements are considerable. A disadvantage of the pneumatic system is the tubing transmission line, which affords a path out of radiation enclosure for contaminated fluids or vapors in case of release of radioactivity coupled with a line break.

HRE-2 system. A combined electric-pneumatic system (described in Article 7-4. 8) is used in HRE-2. In the control room, electric signals from primary variable sensing elements (temperature, flow, liquid level, pressure, etc. ) are converted by transducers to pneumatic signals, and these are used to actuate miniature pneumatic display instruments and pneumatic valves in the reactor. The escape of radioactivity through air lines is prevented by the automatic closure of "block valves within the vapor-contained area, on a signal of the release of radiation. Radiation damage to primary elements is avoided by the use of inorganic electrical insulations such as glass, ceramics, mica, magnesium oxide, and magnesium silicate. Electric control actions are derived from the pneumatic signals by pressure switches. These switches are simple devices in which diaphragm deflection opens or closes an electric circuit.

Knowledge of liquid levels in reactor systems and loops is critical for maintaining the proper balance of liquid and vapor in pressurizers and storage tanks. It is also desired to be able to maintain accurate inventories of the hazardous and valuable fluids that are contained.

There are a large number of liquid-level sensing devices in use, since no one device has been developed which satisfies all the criteria of precision, rapid response, insensitivity to temperature and pressure, and utility of its signal for control functions. Devices which have been used at ORNL are described in the following paragraphs.

A 5-inch-long displacer suspended by two helical springs (-20). An extension rod above the springs positions a magnetic piston in the center of a differential transformer. Troublesome vibration of the float is damped by the action of the field from permanent magnets on a one-turn copper ring. The only non-welded closure is the ring-joint flange, which makes the unit easily replaceable.

The differential transformer is a compact, highly sensitive linear device commercially available.

Float transmitters of this type have also been built with cantilever springs, with floats up to 47 in. long, and with hydraulic damping vanes attached to the bottom of the float in lieu of the magnetic damping. They have given excellent service in continuous control applications. However, the displacement transmitter is quite sensitive to fluid densities, and the springs exhibit some changes in properties with temperature.

Hollow spherical floats, lighter than water, have also been used at pressures below 600 psi. Magnetrol, Inc. makes a unit in which float position is transmitted magnetically.

Differential-Pressure Cells. D/P cells have been used successfully in HRE-1 and in loops as level transmitters. The variable liquid leg is compared to a reference level maintained by condensation or liquid addition. Since the density of water is temperature-dependent, the temperature of the primary system and the lines to the D/P cell must be known for accurate level measurement.

Weigh Systems. For obtaining an accurate inventory of HRE-2 storage tanks, they are weighed with pneumatic weigh cells. This was found to be the only feasible method of measuring the quantity of liquid in long, horizontal storage tanks. Piping to the tanks is kept flexible by Tank Cleaning. This removes any accumulated sludge and sediment from the bottom of the tank, as well as any scale or corrosion products that may have formed on the walls. Tank Venting. These valves open automatically if the pressure in the tank exceeds a predetermined limit, preventing an overpressure condition that could cause damage to the tank or surrounding equipment. Tank Insulation. This reduces heat loss from the liquid in the tank, which helps to maintain its temperature within a desired range.

The use of horizontal L and U bends. A pneumatic system is selected primarily because taring can be done remotely with balancing air pressures, and components are less susceptible to radiation damage. The pneumatic load cells, which are supplied by the A. H. Emery Corporation, have an accuracy of 1/10%; however, when used in a system with solid pipe connections to the weighed vessels, an accuracy of 1% of full load results.

Heated Thermocouple Wells. Heated thermocouple wells have been used for liquid-level alarm or control. The thermocouple junction is normally held a few degrees above the vapor temperature. As the liquid level surrounds the probe, the increased heat transmission to the fluid from the probe lowers the thermocouple signal output. Several wells must be used for control purposes. This system gives a rather sluggish response.

Capacitance Probe. An aluminum oxide capacitance probe, manufactured by Fielden Instrument Division, has been recently received by ORNL but has not yet been evaluated. This instrument senses the dielectric constant of the medium it contacts. Its ceramic-to-metal seal is rated at 2000 psi and 636°F. This type of instrument may prove useful in water or steam environments where conventional probes are not practical.

Fluid Damping Transmitters. The Dynatrol transmitter, manufactured by Automation Products, Inc. , is an interesting possibility for use as a fluid damping transmitter. It contains a vane exposed to the process system and vibrated through a pressure housing by alternating current excitation of a solenoid. The degree of damping, which is dependent on the area of the vane covered with liquid, is measured by a second sensing coil. No test experience with this transmitter is yet available.

Unusually difficult level-sensing problems arise when it is desired to measure or control the true level of a slurry or boiling liquid. Most proven devices are density-sensitive, and the mean density of two-phase systems is usually unknown. Of the level transmitter types cited above, none appears adequate for continuous-range indication. For spot indication, float, capacitance, and Dynatrol transmitters are promising.

Pressure and differential-pressure measurement. Bourdon tubes of weld-sealed 347 stainless steel are used for pressure transmission in the HRE-2. Most suitable for reactor use are units contained within secondary pressure housings, such as the 2500-psi pressure transmitter shown in -21. Baldwin cells have been widely used for accurate pressure measurement.

Pressure transmitters are typically integrated into the steam or water sections of aqueous homogeneous systems to minimize the risk of clogging or other harm. In cases where connecting a D/P cell to a slurry system is essential, the pipe connection is routinely flushed with 10 to 30 cc/min of water. Additionally, large vertical piping connections with the transmitter positioned above the main piping have been utilized. Flush-mounted diaphragm transmitters are currently under development for slurry applications.

Flow transmitters. Flow measurements are made in high-pressure lines by sensing the pressure drop across a calibrated orifice or venturi, or by the transmitting variable-area type of flowmeter. The latter meter resembles a Rotameter with float position transmitted electrically.

Another system for metering and controlling small liquid and gas flows in the HRE-2 is illustrated in Figure 22. The pressure drop across the metering capillary is measured by the differential-pressure transmitter, and the output signal is calibrated in terms of flow.

Temperature measurement. The most commonly used method of temperature detection in the HRE-2 is the thermocouple measurement of vessel and pipe wall temperatures. Couples are spot-welded directly to the wall and then covered with insulation. When faster response is desired, thermocouples are spring-loaded into thin thermowells. Chromel-Alumel wire is generally used because its resistance to corrosive attack by moisture is better than that of iron-constantan alloys.

Thermocouple wire insulated by compressed magnesium oxide powder and housed in various alloy tubes is available from the Thermo Electric Company. Another commonly used wire supplied by the Claud 8. Gordon Company is insulated as follows: each strand is coated with phenol formaldehyde varnish and Fiberglass-impregnated with a silicone alkyd copolymer, and the entire wire is Fiberglass-impregnated with a silicone alkyd copolymer.

Gamma radiation measurement. Gamma monitors for detecting process leaks, manufactured by the Victoreen Instrument Company, consist of a simple one-tube, three-decade logarithmic amplifier sealed within the chamber head and a remote-contact-making meter and multipoint recorder. These detectors can be remotely calibrated by exposing a radioactive source upon the actuation of a solenoid-operated shielding shutter.

Duplicated and control action is initiated only upon a simultaneous signal from both channels to minimize false "scrams. " However, a signal from either channel is annunciated. For monitoring control areas for personnel protection, more stable and accurate vibrating-condenser types of electrometers are used.

A high-level gamma ionization chamber developed at ORNL is used to measure cell ambient radiation levels up to 107 r/hr. This measurement is needed to evaluate the effectiveness of shielding, to assay the rate of radiation damage to reactor components, to measure radiation levels during maintenance operations, and to provide data for future reactor designs. The chamber is of inexpensive construction and is discarded upon failure.

8-5. 4 Electrical wiring and accessories. Copper-clad compressed magnesium oxide spaced and insulated electrical cable is very desirable for service in extremely high-temperature, radioactive, or wet areas because no organic material subject to cracking and outgassing is used in the insulation. A waterproof disconnect, designed to be broken remotely to permit the removal of reactor electrical equipment, is used with this type of cable. The electrical connectors are terminated inside the disconnect with a multiple-header ceramic-to-metal seal, voids being filled with magnesium oxide powder.

Oxide powder. The outside guides are tapered to simplify remote maintenance. Long insulators are used on the connecting terminals to minimize leakage currents after submersion. The cable is available in a varied number of conductors and sizes, from single to seven conductors in a copper sheath, as wire sizes No. 16 AWG to 4/0 AWG, from the General Cable Company. The hermetic end seals are available from the Advanced Vacuum Products Corporation or Permaseal Corporation.

A compression seal designed around an inorganic material, magnesium silicate, is used to seal wires at conduit terminations. These seals are supplied by the Conax Company. A similar device but utilizing a glass-to-metal seal is manufactured by the Stupakoff Ceramic and Manufacturing Company.

For the windings used on the motion-sensing coils of instruments, 30-gauge anodized aluminum wire supplied by the Sigmund Cohn Company is recommended. The only electrical insulation on the wire is that afforded by the oxide film on the aluminum. This wire must be handled carefully to avoid abrasion and is suitable only for low-voltage use. For lower temperatures, the Ceroc magnet wire available from the Sprague Electric Company has been used very successfully.

9-1. 1 The status of large-scale technology. A large number of groups in the national laboratories and in industry have prepared detailed designs of full-scale homogeneous reactors because of the widespread interest in these reactors and the generally accepted conclusion that they have long-term potential for central-station power production and other applications. These designs have, in some cases, been made to compare the economics of power production in homogeneous reactors with other nuclear plants. In other cases, the designs have served as the bases for actual construction proposals. Unfortunately, none of the proposals has yet initiated the construction of a reactor, for it is believed that the gap between the existing technology of small plants and that necessary for a full-scale plant is too great to bridge at the present time. The extensive studies of full-scale plants do, however, constitute a body of information vital to the nuclear industry. It is hoped that the summaries of the large-scale homogeneous reactors given in this chapter will serve as a guide to those contemplating the building of a full-scale nuclear plant.

Underwater maintenance, in which all equipment is installed in a shield that can be filled with water after shutdown of the reactor, so that maintenance operations can be performed from above with special tools and with visibility provided through the water.

In either case, remote opening and closing of flanged joints or remote cutting and rewelding of piping must be used to remove and replace equipment. A solution to the problem of maintaining flanged joints in a leak-tight condition in large sizes has not been attempted, the largest pipe in use today being 48 inches in diameter.

The technology of solution systems is in a more advanced stage of development than that of slurry systems because of the design and operation of two homogeneous reactor experiments and the associated development work. Some of the problems remaining to be solved for large-scale solution reactors include the development of large-scale equipment such as pumps, valves, feed pumps, and heat exchangers; radiation corrosion of materials used in the reactor core; high-pressure recombination of hydrogen and oxygen; and reduction of the number of vital components upon which reactor operation depends. Instruments for measuring temperature in high radiation fields and control of inventory and level are some of the major instrumentation problems for which better solutions are needed.

The achievement of a successful aqueous homogeneous thorium breeder requires a high-pressure thorium-oxide slurry system. Development work has been underway for several years to determine the characteristics of such a system and to develop ways of handling slurries. The technology is not yet advanced to the point where a large-scale breeder reactor of this type can be built and operated.

Extrapolation of small-scale technology to large-scale design presents several problems of uncertain magnitude, especially in the design of equipment for handling slurries of thorium oxide such as are specified for one- or two-region breeder reactors. The problems of maintenance of slurry systems are essentially the same as for solutions but are complicated by the erosive nature of the slurry, its relatively high shear strength, and its tendency to cake or settle in regions of low turbulence.

9-1. 2 Summary of design studies. The design studies described in this chapter were made by the national laboratories of the Atomic Energy Commission and by various industrial study groups for the purpose of determining the technological and economic feasibility of aqueous homogeneous reactor systems as applied to central station power, research reactors, and the production of plutonium. In general, the design criteria used in the studies conform as closely as possible to known technology in order to minimize the scope of new developments required to ensure the success of the proposals. In all the studies, the importance of over-all safety and reliability of the reactor complex and individual reactor components has been emphasized. Also, considerable attention has been devoted to the maintenance aspects of the designs.

9-2. 1 Relation of plant layout to remote maintenance methods. In laying out a homogeneous reactor plant, the designers must simultaneously consider all aspects of the design, including the requirements for remote maintenance. It is usual to start with the high-pressure reactor system (the reactor vessel, circulating pump, steam generator, and surge chamber and pressurizer) since there exists a natural relationship between these items in elevation. The layout will depend primarily on whether a one-region reactor or two-region reactor is involved since in the latter case special provision for removing the inner core may be necessary. If it is feasible to construct the reactor vessel and core tank as an integral all-welded unit, the layout of the system will be considerably simplified.

Circulating pumps are vulnerable from the standpoint of long-term reliability, and extreme care must be given to their placement and anchorage in the system layout. Installations and designs to date place the circulating pumps in a position following the steam generator and the gas separator and low in the cell in order to provide as low a temperature and least gas binding conditions as possible. These pumps, however, will operate at an overpressure considerably in excess of saturation pressure, and if gas binding does not prohibit, it may be desirable to place the circulating pumps at a position more accessible for maintenance.

Philosophy being considered uses many small steam generators in order to permit easier removal and replacement when necessary. One difficulty with this scheme will be the problem of finding leaky tubes.

The steam generators are usually one of the bulkiest items of equipment installed in the plant and hence will largely determine the size of the containment vessel and amount of shielding. Their location should be such that some heat-removal capacity can be obtained by natural convection circulation in the event of failure of the circulating pump.

In considering the layout of the surge chamber, which is normally also the pressurizer, connecting piping must be as short as possible, and the diameter of the piping should be large for safe control of the reactor. If a steam generator is used to provide high-pressure D2O or H2O vapor, it should be separated from the surge chamber and preferably placed in a location separate from the reactor compartment to facilitate maintenance.

9-2. 2 Importance of specifications. To ensure that materials such as type-347 stainless steel, titanium, and zirconium alloys meet the qualifications required for homogeneous systems, very rigid specifications covering strength, corrosion-resisting properties, impact resistance, etc. , must be prepared. To ensure leak-tight integrity, specifications describing acceptable weld joints and welding procedures are issued. Such specifications will also describe the welder qualifications required. Since it is imperative that the main process piping system shall be absolutely clean and purged of any material which may poison the reactor or accelerate corrosion, cleaning procedures are a necessary part of the specifications.

9-2. 3 Approach to an optimum piping system. The cost of the piping system is one of the major items of expense, and its selection and arrangement constitute one of the major items of design. However, the pipe diameters are generally determined on a maximum-velocity basis, determined by corrosion rates rather than from economic considerations. The weight classification (i. e. , pipe wall thickness) is selected on the basis of pressure, temperature, and corrosion rate for the proposed service life of the reactor system using the appropriate design stresses from the ASME Code for the particular metal used. Other factors influencing piping layouts are (a) provision for drainage, (b) provision for expansion, (c) accessibility and convenience of operation, (d) provision for support, and (e) the thickness of insulation.

For special anchors needed to control expansion in accordance with the design plan. The efficiency of the piping system layout depends largely on the ability of the designer to visualize the overall situation and to select the best arrangement. The design of a piping system for minimum holdup may be relegated to secondary importance compared with the ease of maintainability of the systems.

Piping joints for homogeneous reactor systems must be capable of assembly and disassembly by remote methods and must have essentially zero leakage. The first requirement implies some type of mechanical joint such as used on the HRE-1 and HRE-2. However, such a system requires a reliable and easily manipulatable remote cutting and welding machine not yet developed.

9-2. 4 Shielding problems in a large-scale plant. Poor shield design can lead to excessive cost and reduced accessibility for maintenance. Practical shield designs are developed through the use of methods in the literature with particular attention to factors pertaining to the shield layout, such as the arrangement of the piping and heat exchanger system, materials selection, radioactivity of the shutdown system, effect of radiation streaming through openings, and the effect of the geometry of the radiation sources.

A number of proposed designs of large-scale homogeneous reactors use a compartmentalized type of shield. This consists of a primary shield surrounding the reactor pressure vessel to attenuate the neutron flux and reduce the radioactivity of auxiliary equipment, and a secondary shield surrounding the coolant system. From a shielding standpoint, the most highly radioactive sources should be located near the center of the compartment; components of lower source strength should be arranged progressively outward, and equipment with little radioactivity should be located to serve a dual purpose as shielding material where possible. High-intensity sources containing primary coolant, which are poorly located from a shielding standpoint, may be partially shadow-shielded. Equipment requiring little or no maintenance and which can provide shielding should be located around the outside of the secondary shield. Considerable weight can be saved by contouring the secondary (coolant) shield (i. e. , varying its thickness over the surface) to give closer conformance with the specified permissible dose pattern.

With respect to sample lines which penetrate the coolant shield and contain radioactive materials of short half-lives, the transport time from the primary coolant system to the outside of the shield should be made as long as practical to take advantage of the decay of the coolant activity.

9-2. 5 Containment. Because of the possibility of the release of highly radioactive fuel solution from a homogeneous reactor, such systems are now being designed to go within a containment vessel or to use doubly contained piping. The containment vessel must be designed to hold the pressure resulting from the expansion of the fluid and vapor contents of the equipment. Such pressures may be of the order of 50 psi. Although the best shape of a containment vessel is either a cylinder or a sphere, such configurations present problems with respect to remote maintenance.

9-2. 6 Steam power cycles for homogeneous reactors. Separately fired superheating equipment, using conventional fuels, may be expedient in some particular circumstances of plant size, load factors, and fuel costs, but, in general, superheating by this means is not justified. Use of low-pressure saturated steam limits the thermal efficiency obtainable in the heat-power cycle to maximum values in the range of 25 to 30%.

Homogeneous reactor systems circulate a hot reactor fluid to a steam generator at essentially constant temperature. The temperature of the fluid leaving the exchanger is varied with load by changing the temperature difference for heat transfer, by controlling the pressure at which the water boils in the steam generator. Since the steam pressure falls as the turbine control valves open on increased electrical generator loads, the negative temperature coefficient for the reactivity causes the reactor power output to be self-regulating to match the power demand on the plant.

The full-load steam pressure will be in the order of 450 to 600 psia, and the near no-load pressure in excess of 1000 psia. The steam piping and turbine casing must be designed for this maximum pressure rather than the full-load pressure. Design pressures of 1500 psia have been used for the steam systems of the HRE-1 and HRE-2.

Mass flow rates and flow areas affect the cost of governor valves and high-pressure stages for a specific power output. The costly low-pressure stages necessitate more flow area, potentially leading to increased expenses due to additional compounding. In saturated steam turbines, turbine efficiency tends to be lower compared to those using superheated steam due to the higher level of entrained moisture present in the steam.

Flow delay tanks in the steam supply mains are considered necessary to allow time for a stop valve to close in the event radioactivity is detected in the steam flow from the heat exchangers. Heat losses in this equipment tend to increase the moisture in the steam, and a separator may be required at the turbine inlet. The pressure loss in typical separators is about 5% of the inlet pressure, and the leaving quality is about 99%. Some method of moisture removal must be provided during the expansion process, either internally in each of the low-pressure stages or externally in one or more separators located between turbine elements. Studies have indicated that the optimum location for the first stage external moisture separator is at 10% of the throttle pressure.

As with steam power cycles for other reactor types, an emergency bypass will likely be required to send the steam directly to the turbine condenser in the event of loss of turbine load. The condenser must be designed to dispose of the full output energy of the reactor plant. The number of stages of feedwater heating economically justified is probably limited to three or four since the temperature range in the cycle is not great.

Treatment of the water fed to the steam generators is a special problem in that the water should be essentially free of chloride ions to reduce the opportunity for stress-corrosion cracking in stainless steel parts of the system. The water should be deaerated to control corrosion in the steam system, it should be demineralized to reduce the radioactivity pickup of the steam and in the heat exchanger blowdown, and additives may be necessary to control the pH and to scavenge oxygen formed by radiolytic decomposition of the water. Decomposition of these additives under radiation poses problems not yet fully investigated.

Control of the water level in the steam generator involves much the same problems due to steam bubbles that are experienced in conventional boilers, with the added complexity that the steam pressure decreases as the load on the plant increases. Sizing of the ports in the feedwater regulating valves must take this into consideration, and the boiler feed pumps must be designed for the full-load rather than the no-load head requirements.

The desirability of minimizing gas production within the reactor is crucial. Unless the superheat is more than 100°F, a saturated cycle with moisture separation may be as efficient and practical as a cycle using superheated steam, provided that in either case, the moisture in the turbine exhaust is kept the same. It is also possible to superheat at the expense of throttle pressure. While superheat is normally considered to increase thermal efficiency, this is not true if the inlet steam temperature is independent of the amount of superheat. Additionally, the lower pressure associated with throttling results in increased turbine costs. Superheating by means of a conventional plant does not appear economical.

In studies of homogeneous reactors, saturated steam cycles are assumed, in which 12% moisture is permitted in the last stages of the turbine. Thermal efficiencies of such plants are shown in Figure 1 as a function of the steam temperature at the turbine throttle.

Aqueous solution reactor for the Wolverine Electric Cooperative in Hersey was canceled in May 1958 following a review of the design and estimated costs. This review indicated that the cost of generating electricity would be several times as great as that in Wolverine's existing plant.

The fuel solution of highly enriched uranyl sulfate in heavy water is circulated by a canned-motor pump located in the cold leg of the primary loop and pressurized to prevent boiling and cavitation in the pump. The steam generated in the heat exchanger is superheated in a gas-fired superheater, and the superheated steam drives conventional turbogenerating equipment for the production of electricity.

The nuclear reactor plant is designed to permit initial operation at 5 MW with a single superheater-turbogenerator unit. By adding a second unit, the capacity can be increased to 10 MW. Doubling the electrical capacity is thus accomplished without making any changes to the reactor other than adjusting the operating temperatures and uranium concentration.

A pressurizer is connected to the outlet of the heat exchanger to pressurize the system with oxygen to 1900 psia and to provide a location in the primary system for the removal of fission-product and other noncondensable gases. The layout of the primary system is such as to permit heat removal by natural circulation in case of pump failure.

Design data. Pertinent design information for the reactor systems and components is summarized in Table 9-1 and described in the following paragraphs. Unless otherwise noted, all surfaces in contact with the fuel solution are fabricated of type-347 stainless steel.

Equipment and system descriptions: Reactor vessel. The single-region, concentric-inlet, and -outlet pressure vessel designed for 2500 psia incorporate two inner concentric thermal shields to reduce gamma heating effects in the outer pressure vessel. The thermal shields are constructed of type-347 stainless steel and are 1 in. and 2 in.

Primary heat exchanger: The steam generator consists of a horizontal U-shaped shell-and-tube heat exchanger with a separate steam drum. These are interconnected with downcomers and risers to provide natural circulation of the boiling secondary water. Fuel solution is circulated on the tube side of the heat exchanger, and the boiling secondary water is circulated on the shell side. Feedwater is introduced into the liquid region of the steam-separating drum. All components in contact with the secondary water and steam are to be fabricated from conventional boiler steels.

Fuel circulating pump. A single, constant-speed, water-cooled, canned motor-type pump is provided to maintain fuel circulation in the primary loop. The rotating elements are removable through the top of the unit and may be removed without disturbing the piping connections to the stator casing or the pump volute. Regions of high fluid velocity in the pump, including the impeller, are titanium or titanium-lined. A purge flow of condensate is fed into the top end of the pump to reduce erosion and corrosion of bearings, as well as to prolong the life of the motor windings by reducing the radiation dose to the electrical installation. In the event of pump failure, the reactor will undergo a routine shutdown, and the fission-product decay heat will be removed by natural circulation through the steam generator.

Pressurizer: A small sidestream of fuel solution is continuously directed into the pressurizer, where it spills through a distribution header and drips down through an oxygen gas space to the liquid reservoir in the bottom of the vessel. The pressurizer liquid return line is connected to the suction side of the primary-loop circulating pump. Oxygen is added batchwise to the pressurizer to keep the fuel saturated at all times to prevent precipitation of uranium. As fission-product gases accumulate in the pressurizer, they are vented to the off-gas system, also in a batchwise operation.

Containment. The primary coolant system is enclosed in a 40-ft-diameter spherical carbon-steel vessel, lined with 2 ft of concrete, interconnected with a 12-ft-diameter by 50-ft-long stainless-clad vessel housing the dump of the primary cell. Since these vessels provide a net containment volume of approximately 31,000 ft³, the vaporization and release of the reactor contents result in a maximum pressure of approximately 105 psi. Accordingly, the primary-cell containment vessel wall thickness is 15/16 in. A spray system is incorporated in the design to quickly reduce the pressure within the containment vessel by condensing the water vapor present.

Biological shielding. The plant's biological shielding is indicated on the general arrangement drawing (fig. 9-2). The shielding for the primary system, including the reactor core, consists of a 2-ft thickness of ordinary concrete lining the inside of the primary-cell containment vessel and a minimum of 7 ft of concrete surrounding the outside of the vessel, cooled by a series of cooling-water coils located in the 2-ft-thick liner. The top of the primary vessel is shielded with 6 ft of removable blocks of barytes aggregate concrete (average density of approximately 220 lb/ft³) located beneath the removable portion of the containment vessel.

A 2-foot-thick water-cooled heavy aggregate thermal shield is placed around the reactor vessel to reduce the radiation level to approximately that of the remainder of the primary system. The primary coolant pump access pit, located inside the containment vessel, is constructed of 34 feet of barytes aggregate concrete to permit pump removal after the primary cell has been filled with water and the system drained and partially decontaminated.

Around each of the analytical and chemical processing cells, there will be a minimum of 4 ft of ordinary concrete with a maintenance gallery between these facilities for access to and operation of the cells. Each of the two analytical cells will be provided with thick glass windows adequate for shielding. The dump-tank cell will be shielded by a 5-ft thickness of reinforced concrete.

Remote maintenance: Both dry and underwater removal methods are proposed for remote maintenance of radioactive components in this system, following practices similar to those developed for HRE-2. All the equipment cells are provided with stainless steel liners to permit the cells to be filled with ordinary water during maintenance operations. For the removal of the large components, it is necessary to move the container vessel cover through the west end of the building to a temporary storage area. After the primary vessel cover and top shield are removed, the system components are accessible by crane and operations are performed with specially designed long-handled tools.

9-3. 2 Aqueous Homogeneous Research Reactor—feasibility study. A preliminary investigation of the feasibility of an aqueous homogeneous research reactor (HRR) for producing a thermal flux of 5 x 10¹⁰ neutrons/(cm²)(sec) was completed by the Oak Ridge National Laboratory in the spring of 1957. The design considered is illustrative of a homogeneous reactor capable of producing high neutron fluxes for research and power for the production of electricity.

The system operates at solution temperatures of 225 to 275°C and a total system pressure of 1400 psia. Under these conditions, a maximum thermal neutron flux of 6. 5 X 10^5 neutrons/(cm^2 sec) is achieved in a 10-ft-diameter stainless-steel-lined carbon-steel sphere. Approximate power densities are 2 kW/liter at the core wall, 35 kW/liter on average, and 110 kW/liter maximum.

To minimize corrosion of equipment and piping in the external circuit, all flow velocities are held to values below the critical velocities. Estimated corrosion rates are 70 to 80 mpy for the Zircaloy-2 experimental thimbles and about 10 mpy for the stainless-steel liner of the reactor vessel based on a maximum flow velocity of 3 fps.

Fission- and corrosion-product solids, produced at a rate of approximately 20 lb/day under normal reactor operating conditions, are concentrated into 750 liters of fuel solution by means of hydroclones with self-contained underflow pots and removed from the reactor to limit the buildup of fission and corrosion products. This solution is subsequently treated for recovery of uranium and D2O.

The special problems introduced by the heating of the shell from radiation absorption and by the necessity of penetrating the shell for insertion of experimental thimbles. The proposed vessel is fabricated of a carbon-steel base material with a type-347 stainless steel cladding on all surfaces exposed to the fuel solution.

The fuel solution enters the vessel through two 24-inch nozzles, sized for a fluid velocity of 10 to 15 fps, flows upward through the vessel, and exits through two 18-inch nozzle connectors in the top, sized for a fluid velocity of 30 to 40 fps. A diffuser screen, serving also as part of the thermal shield, is placed at the entrance to the reactor vessel.

Heat exchangers (steam generators). Six heat exchangers of 83. 3 MW capacity each are required to dissipate the 500 MW of heat generated in the reactor. The design of these consists of a lower vaporizing shell connected to a steam drum at a suitable elevation to promote natural circulation by means of risers and downcomers welded to the shells. Specifications are summarized in Table 9-2.

Pressurizer: The pressurizer surge chamber, constructed of 24-inch schedule-100 pipe, provides the necessary 1500 liters of surge volume. Space limitations and accessibility problems make this separation desirable.

System design: Two 17,650-gpm pumps are mounted on the outlet pipes of the heat exchanger to circulate the reactor solution around the primary circuit. Saturated steam at 300 psia is generated at a rate of 2. 11 X 10^6 lb/hr and is used to generate 133,000 kW of gross electrical power at a cycle efficiency of 26. 5%. A net power generation of 125,000 kW will be delivered at the station bus bars, with approximately 6% being required for station auxiliaries. Feedwater, consisting of D2O from the condensate tank, is supplied to the steam generator through an economizer by means of a 0. 5-gpm feedwater pump. The reactor does not contain a letdown system for separating and recombining radiolytic gases, since 100% internal recombination will be achieved by means of an internal copper catalyst. Key design parameters are summarized in Table 9-3.

Figure 9-3 is a plan view of the reactor complex, indicating the general relation of the reactor pressure vessel and its auxiliaries to the heat exchangers and circulating pumps. Shielded cubicles around the reactor provide a means for handling the experimental thimbles. The outer diameter of the containment vessel around the cubicles is approximately 60 ft.

A sectional elevation of the reactor complex is shown in Figure 4. The arrangement of the heat exchangers relative to the reactor vessel is such that natural circulation through the system will be promoted in the event of pump failure. The containment vessel for the reactor is a vertical cylindrical tank. Two separate horizontally mounted containment vessels, each 60 feet in diameter, house the heat exchanger equipment. The dump tanks are directly below the heat exchanger containment vessels. Means for limited access to those portions of the dump tank system, which will require periodic maintenance, such as dump valves, are provided.

Unique design features: five horizontal in-pile thimbles spaced equally on the midplane of the reactor opening into cubicles, and one vertical nozzle opening from the top of the reactor are included in the design. Figure 9-5 shows the location of the thimbles relative to the containment vessel and cubicles, and the shield arrangement. As shown by Figure 9-5, piping to the heat exchangers passes through one of the hot-cell working areas. Consequently, this area is not usable for experiments but contains the pressurizer and other items that must be adjacent to the reactor but removed far enough from the reactor cell to permit maintenance.

Maintenance concept. Both dry and underwater removal methods have been investigated for the HRR, but both schemes present difficult design problems. The dry-maintenance philosophy, chosen on an arbitrary basis, has been followed in the layouts presented herein.

Be largely confined to the reactor auxiliary equipment and to the experimental thimbles and equipment. The reactor vessel itself is designed for the life of the system with thickness for the pressure vessel wall and corrosion liner selected accordingly on the basis of existing corrosion data.

The handling equipment in the reactor containment vessel consists of a revolving-type crane with a shielded cab for the operator and provision for remote operation from outside the shielded area using commercial, remotely operated television cameras. Access from above to any part of the area is thus possible, and all flanges and pipe disconnects are faced upward to facilitate removal.

A horizontal traveling crane, also with a shielded control cab and remote-operation control, is provided in each of the containment vessels for the removal of the heat-exchanger equipment. Flanges connecting the circulating pumps and heat exchangers with the main piping are faced horizontally in these installations. All flanges are grouped at one end of the area, and bolts are removed by means of remotely manipulated tools from a shielded cell.

Tracks can be moved horizontally along the track and onto another track section, which can move transversely. From this section, the heat exchanger is moved through a large airlock-type door at the end of the containment vessel to the maintenance area. The circulating pumps are designed so that the pump impeller and motor windings may be removed vertically without removing the pump casing.

During any part of the maintenance procedure, the system is shut down and drained, and the piping and equipment decontaminated as thoroughly as possible. Shut-off valves of a size and type suitable for the piping of the HRR have not been developed.

9-3. 3 The Advanced Engineering Test Reactor. A study was completed in March 1957 by Aeronutronic Systems, Inc. to select a reactor system for an advanced engineering test reactor (AETR), with seven major loop facilities providing a thermal-neutron flux >2 x 10^5 neutrons/(cm2) (sec) [6]. To obtain the required flux level while keeping the power density low, only heavy water-moderated reactors were considered. Comparisons of two heterogeneous and one homogeneous type, and comparison of single and multiple reactor installations, led to the conclusion that a single homogeneous reactor provides the greatest flexibility and is the most economical system for research at high neutron fluxes. The core would consist of 367 fuel elements arranged in a hexagonal lattice pattern. Each element would be a graphite-moderated, enriched uranium alloy slug containing 149 fuel pins with a diameter of 0. 5 inch and length of 12 inches. The fuel pins would be arranged in a circular array within the graphite moderator.

The coolant would be heavy water flowing through a primary loop surrounding the core, with heat being removed by a secondary loop containing light water. The AETR reference design includes seven major loop facilities: 1) a primary heavy water pump and heat exchanger; 2) a primary heavy water circulation system; 3) a secondary heavy water pump and heat exchanger; 4) a secondary heavy water circulation system; 5) a light water cooling tower; 6) a light water storage tank; and 7) a control room. The reactor would be located in a shielded building, with the primary loop located outside the building and the secondary loop located inside. The facility would be operated by a staff of 10 to 20 scientists and engineers under the direction of an operating contractor.

Description of reactor. The 500-MW reactor consists of a large core operating at moderate temperature and pressure and containing a D2O solution of 10% enriched uranyl sulfate (10 g total U/liter). The reactor design, which was based upon the design and operational experience of the HRE-1 and HRE-2 and upon a design study for a homogeneous research reactor by ORNL, features continuous fission-product removal and fuel addition to maintain the total contained excess reactivity at an essentially constant level. In the center, or loop region, the unperturbed thermal-neutron flux is approximately 6 X 10^5 neutrons/(cm^2) (sec).

The reactor vessel is a spherical, stainless steel container with an internal diameter of 8 ft and a wall thickness of 3/4 in. , contained in a cylindrical pressure vessel with balanced pressures inside and out. The design is such that the test loop and coolant circuit tubes emerging through the lid of the pressure vessel can be disconnected; the packing glands at the bottom of the pressure vessel removed, and the entire reactor core vessel can be lifted out of the main container. The thin walls of the core vessel give it a low gross weight, enabling it to be lifted conveniently.

Westinghouse Electric Corporation joined forces in November 1954 to survey various reactor types for power generation. The results of the survey indicated the potential of the aqueous homogeneous reactor to be exceedingly encouraging and led to the formal establishment of the Pennsylvania Advanced Reactor Project in August 1955 to study the technical and economic feasibility of a large aqueous homogeneous reactor plant for central service application having an electrical output of at least 150,000 kW.

Two reactor plant reference designs were completed, and preliminary equipment layouts and cost estimates of these two plants were prepared. In the first design, it was proposed to use overhead dry maintenance with the equipment housed in a vertical cylinder 124 ft in diameter and 175 ft long. By incorporating shutoff valves in the system, any one of the four main coolant loops could be isolated in case of an equipment failure to permit the remainder of the plant to continue operation.

Figures 9-6 and 9-7 show a plan and cross-sectional elevation of Reference Design 1A. In this design, a mixed-oxide slurry of a concentration of about 260 g/kg of D2O, corresponding to a solids concentration of approximately 3% by volume, is circulated through the reactor vessel. The reactor vessel is located in the center of the loop, and the slurry branches into four parallel identical loops.

Each loop contains a circulating pump, a gas separator, and a steam generator. The system is pressurized with 2000 psia steam generated in a D2O steam generator connected to a surge chamber mounted in close-coupled position to the reactor vessel. The major portion of radiolytic gases is recombined internally; the remainder (~10%) is left unrecombined in order to purge the system of xenon and other gaseous fission products. These gases are removed from the main stream by a pipeline gas separator to a catalytic-type recombiner. The recombined heavy water is used to wash the primary pump bearings and as makeup water to the steam generator.

A small bleed stream is concentrated in the slurry letdown system and delivered to a chemical processing plant where the uranium and thorium are recovered by a Thorex solvent extraction process. The chemical plant is designed for a small throughput and low overall decontamination factors. Although the rates of flow to the auxiliary systems are small compared with the 18,000,000 lb/hr rate of circulation in the primary system, these auxiliary systems contribute the major part of the complexity of the plant and a large fraction of its cost.

The reactor vessel is shielded separately; however, the four primary coolant loops are contained in one large compartment with no shielding between the separate loops. Auxiliary equipment is contained in separate compartments, with the equipment being segregated according to the type and level of radioactivity after shutdown. In addition, like pieces of equipment have been grouped to permit the use of relatively permanent maintenance facilities designed into that particular area. Personnel access corridors are provided to permit limited access to certain areas inside the vapor container during full power operation of the reactor.

Dry maintenance operations are accomplished primarily through the use of a 100-ton, shielded-cab crane, which traverses the length of the reactor container. Since the cab can be occupied during operation, the crane serves as a remote tool for handling heavy shield blocks and removing and replacing equipment. The design is based on an all-welded piping system, and removal of any item requires a remote cutting and welding machine.

Because of the vulnerability of the circulating pumps and steam generators, special modifications are provided to permit these items to be repaired in place. A maintenance facility for repair of the primary circulating pumps is shown in Figure 8. This consists of two mechanical master-slave manipulators inserted through the shielding wall adjacent to the pump, and a mechanical arm which may be placed on two retractable rails cantilevered from the shielding wall. Visibility is obtained by a glass shielding.

Window located beneath the manipulators. The window is designed to be an effective shield only during plant shutdown, and will be covered by iron shutters during plant operation to provide neutron and thermal shielding. A second shielding wall is located behind the work area to make up for the thin wall at this point.

The pump is provided with flanged joints with bolts and all other connections at the top for easy accessibility. The low-pressure cooling water connections are easily disconnected with the manipulators. The high-pressure purge line and vent lines, however, must be disconnected through flanges or by cutting and rewelding. The large flange bolts on the pump are provided with centrally drilled holes into which electric resistance heaters can be inserted with the mechanical master-slave manipulator. A lifting fixture is then lowered from the overhead crane and attached to the pump flange and pump internals, which are then pulled from the pump volute casing. The pump is reinstalled in reverse order.

The steam generator shown in Figure 9 uses inverted vertical U-tubes and has an integral steam separator. The unit is 6 ft in diameter and has an overall length of about 40 ft. Because of its physical size and cost, it is not considered practical to use the spare-part replacement philosophy for this component. Instead, the design of the steam generator and the overall plant layout is such that remote maintenance in place is possible without requiring a prohibitively long shutdown of the plant.

The facility consists of a manipulator unit mounted on a horizontal rack, which drives the unit through the shielding wall into access holes in the steam generator head. The manipulator is used to carry and position a detector for locating a leaky tube and the necessary tools for plugging and welding the tube. The faulty tube is prepared for welding by a specially designed grinding machine positioned and supported by the manipulator. The grinder will automatically shape the tube for a plug, and the seal weld will be made with an automatic welder. This equipment can be moved from one cell to another as needed; thus, all four steam generator tube sheets can be maintained by semi-remote methods.

9-4. 2 Large-scale aqueous plutonium-power reactors. Studies of the feasibility and economics of producing plutonium in homogeneous reactors fueled with slightly enriched uranium as UO2SO4 in D2O were carried out by the Oak Ridge National Laboratory, by the Argonne National Laboratory, and by others. The studies were all based on one-region converters constructed of stainless steel utilizing spherical pressure vessels ranging in size from 15 to 24 ft in diameter. The design and operating characteristics of typical reactors considered in the studies are summarized in Table 9-5.

The general conclusion reached was that aqueous homogeneous reactors are potentially very low-cost plutonium producers; however, considerable development work remains before large-scale reactors can be constructed. The major problem is due to the corrosiveness of the relatively concentrated uranyl sulfate solutions used in such reactors, which requires that all the equipment in contact with high-temperature fuel be made of titanium, or carbon-steel lined, or clad with titanium. The development of suitably strong titanium alloys, bonding methods, or satisfactory steel-titanium joints has not yet proceeded sufficiently to consider the construction of full-scale plutonium producers. Alternate approaches, such as the addition of Li3SO4 to reduce the corrosiveness of stainless steel by the fuel solution (see Chap. 5), show promise but also require further development.

Oak Ridge National Laboratory one-region power reactor studies. A description of the design of a typical large-scale plant with a capacity of approximately 316 net MW of electricity.

The uranium-plutonium or thorium-uranium fuel is pumped at 130,000 gpm through a 15- to 20-ft-diameter core, where the temperature is increased from 213 to 250°C. Slurry leaving the core flows through four large gas separators, where De and O2 are separated and diluted with helium, O2, and D2O vapor, and then to eight 160-MW heat exchangers.

Gas and entrained liquid from the separators pass through four parallel circuits into high-pressure storage tanks, where the entrained liquid is removed to be returned to the reactor. The Dz and Og are recombined on a platinized alumina catalyst and cooled in 17 MW, tubular heat exchangers, which condense the 76 gpm of excess D2O.

The slurry fuel is expected to contain 100 to 300 g/liter of uranium as either oxide or phosphate, and thorium as either oxide or hydroxide suspended in D2O. Estimates of gas generation rates have been based on the use of UOs platelet particles 1 micron thick and approximately 1 to 5 microns on a side. The Gp,o value was taken as 1. 3 molecules of D2O disintegrated per 100 eV of energy dissipated in the slurry, postulating that 80% of the fission fragments escape from the oxide particles. It is possible that much lower G-values will be obtained in representative experiments and that the size of the gas system can thereby be reduced considerably.

A 15-ft-diameter sphere operated at 1000 psi and 250°C requires a 43-in. -thick wall to keep the combined pressure and thermal stress below 15,000 psi. Carbon steel, clad with stainless steel, is specified as the material of construction for the vessel. The thermal shield may be stainless steel or stainless-clad carbon steel, depending on which would be the less costly. The weight of the vessel and thermal shield is 150 tons, while 75 tons of slurry containing 200 g U/liter are required to fill the vessel.

The Nuclear Power Group conducted a study on power stations varying in size from 94 to 1080 megawatts of net electrical generating capacity. The plants analyzed utilized a two-region Th-U reactor. While various plants with different electrical capacities were examined, the focus was on a plant with a net electrical capacity of 180 MwE. The relevant operating conditions of this particular plant are detailed in Table 9-6.

The reactor consists of a 6-ft-diameter spherical core surrounded by a 2-ft-thick blanket, enclosed in an 11 ft 4 in. ID stainless-clad carbon steel pressure vessel with a wall thickness of approximately 6 in. The pressure vessel has a bolted head to permit removal of the concentric-flow core tank if necessary. The fuel solution enters the core through a 24-in. inner pipe and exits through an annulus of equivalent area between two concentric pipes forming the inlet and outlet connections for the core tank. One mechanical joint is required to attach the zirconium core tank to the stainless steel outlet pipe. The slurry enters the blanket through a 24-in. connection in the bottom of the pressure vessel and exits through three 14-in. connections located near the top of the vessel.

Thermal shield: The 4-inch-thick thermal shield, designed to protect the pressure vessel from excessive radiation, consists of two 2-inch-thick stainless steel plates.

Vessel closure. The bolted head closure utilizes two Flexitallic gaskets (asbestos encased in stainless steel), having a low-pressure leak off between gaskets. The internal diameter of the closure is slightly greater than 6 ft to allow for the core tank removal. Similar bolted joints are provided in the inlet and outlet piping connections to the core as well as in the core tank dump line.

Steam generators: Six steam generator units, each consisting of two heat exchangers connected to a common steam drum, are required – three for the core system and three for the blanket heat removal. By using U-bend tubes in the exchangers, the need for an expansion joint in the shell or in the connection to a floating tube sheet is eliminated. This adds reliability to the unit, as any expansion joint subject to even infrequent work is a potential and likely source of trouble.

Utilizing the compartmentalized concept in heat exchangers offers added reliability, ease of fabrication, and a means by which maintenance of the units becomes practical. The individual "bottles," consisting of 19 U-tubes attached to their tube sheets in eccentric pipe reducers by rolling and welding, can be fabricated and tested as units before installation. Drilling of the exchanger head for insertion of the 2-in. inlet and outlet pipes to the "bottles" presents no unusual fabrication problems.

Although the goal is theoretically "leakproof" heat exchangers, provisions are incorporated for maintenance. This has been done in the compartmentalized concept. Should a leak occur, it is practical to seal off the "bottle in which the leak occurs by plugging the 2-in. inlet and outlet pipe connections," rather than remove an entire heat exchanger.

Primary circulating pumps. The hermetically sealed motor, centrifugal pumps required to recirculate the core and blanket fluids are vertical, with the main impeller mounted on the lower end of a shaft on which also is mounted the motor rotor. The motor rotor and bearing chamber are separated from the impeller and volute by means of a labyrinth seal. DO from the high-pressure condensate tank is injected into the bearing chamber and continuously flushed through the labyrinth, thus minimizing corrosion on the rotor and bearing parts. Both the radial and thrust bearings are of the fluid piston type. The drive motors are induction type, suitable for 3-phase 60-cycle 4160-volt power supply. They have impervious liners in the stator bore for hermetic sealing and an outer housing totally enclosing the stator as a second safeguard against loss of system fluid. The motor stator windings are cooled by a liquid passing through tubular conductors installed in the stator. All material in contact with the core solution and D20 is stainless steel, except for the impeller, labyrinth inserts, impeller nut, and wear rings, which are titanium.

Shielding and containment. The reactor plant is housed in a 175-ft diameter steel sphere. Design pressure is 40 psia, which requires a nominal plate thickness of 3/4 in. The sphere is buried to a depth of 50 ft, allowing the reactor vessel to be located below grade for natural ground shielding.

Radioactive components are enclosed by a barytes concrete structure, which serves both as a biological and as a blast shield. The top of this housing is 35 ft above grade elevation. The side walls are 5 ft thick, and the top shield is 6 ft thick except for an 8-ft-thick section directly over the reactor vessel. Compartment walls are provided within the housing to facilitate flooding of individual component sections. The floor and side walls of each of the compartments are lined with 1/8-in. stainless steel plate to permit decontamination. Stepped plugs are provided in the top shield to permit access to the components. The portion of the shielding around the reactor vessel, which is below grade, is 4 ft thick. A slight negative pressure is maintained within the container by continuously discharging a small quantity of air to a stack for dispersal. The quantity of air removed is regulated to control the ambient temperature in the component compartments.

This study indicates that a generating station with a net thermal efficiency of 28. 1% could be constructed for approximately $240 per kilowatt, resulting in capital expenditures of approximately $4. 72 million. These values result in operating costs of approximately 3. 86 cents per kilowatt-hour.

9-5. 2 Single-fluid two-region aqueous homogeneous reactor power plant. Components and plant arrangement have been designed to provide maximum overhead accessibility for maintenance. All components in contact with reactor fuel at high pressure are themselves enclosed in close-fitting high-pressure containment envelopes.

The reactor system is contained in a building 196 feet long, 131 feet wide, and 50 feet high. The equipment is located in a group of gastight cells measuring 196 feet by 131 feet overall. These cells are equipped with pressure-tight concrete lids to facilitate overhead maintenance of the various system components and minimize the radiation shielding required above the floor and outside of the building. All components in the reactor plant have been designed in accordance with this overhead maintenance philosophy.

The basic systems comprising the reactor plant are: 1) A primary system containing the reactor, the main coolant loops, the boiler heat exchangers, the pressurizer, the surge tank, and the standby cooler; 2) the letdown system; 3) the fuel handling and storage system; 4) the off-gas system; and 5) the auxiliary systems containing leak detection and fuel sampling facilities.

The blanket consists of 14 cylindrical assemblies arranged around the periphery of the core region. These assemblies contain thorium-oxide pellet beds which are cooled by fuel flowing from a ring header below the reactor vessel. The fuel follows a zigzag path through the pellets and leaves the assemblies through top outlets, flows through the core region, and out the bottom of the vessel. By this means, the usual core-tank corrosion and replacement problems and slurry handling problems are minimized. By means of devices located at the tops of the tubes extending out of the reactor, the assemblies are periodically rotated to minimize absorption of neutrons by protactinium and equalize the buildup of U235 in the thorium. Replacement of the assemblies is possible through a smaller closure than would be required for a two-region reactor with a single core tank.

The reactor vessel is surrounded by a high-pressure containment vessel, which forms part of the containment system described below.

The boiler heat exchangers are designed so that by removing the head, there is direct access for plugging tubes or for removing entire tube bundles baffled heads and passes through the U-tubes where the steam is generated. The steam-water mixture then leaves the exchangers and flows through a cyclone separator and scrubber to the turbine.

All piping and components holding high-pressure reactor fuel are contained in a close-fitting, pressurized envelope capable of withstanding the total system pressure. These components and piping are further contained in pressure-tight concrete cells, which are vented through rupture disks to a low-pressure gas holder, as shown in Figure 11.

This type of containment permits operation of components for their full service life, reduces or eliminates missile formation and fuel losses, reduces primary system working stresses, and allows equipment arrangement giving maximum access for maintenance.

Reactor. The general characteristics of the reactor are illustrated by -12, which shows the annular arrangement of the Zircaloy-2 blanket assemblies around the core region. The thorium-oxide pellets within these assemblies are cooled by the reactor fuel solution, which is pumped up through the packed beds from the supply header. To reduce the pressure drop across the pebble bed, the solution is introduced through a tapered perforated pipe, the same length as the assemblies, flows into the bed and by means of baffles is directed back to the center outlet pipe, which is concentric with the inlet.

Flanged opening to permit removal of the thorium assemblies. The closure is a double-gasketed bolted cover, having a monitoring or buffer seal connection to the annulus between the gaskets to detect leakage of the fuel solution. The lower-pressure vessel head is penetrated by fourteen 7-in. openings through which fuel flows upward into the blanket assemblies from the toroidal supply header. This head has a 3-ft-diameter fuel outlet. The thermal shielding consists of alternate layers of stainless steel and fuel solution. The total shielding thickness is 8 in. over the cylindrical portion and 12 in. at the head ends of the reactor pressure vessel.

In the design, the tube sheet acts as its shield and is subjected to less intense nuclear radiation, minimizing gamma heating and thermal stress problems. Such a design permits the use of thermal shields, which would also protect the tube sheet from thermal shock due to sudden variations in fuel temperatures. In the event of tube or tube sheet connection failures, it is necessary to remove only the faulty tube bundle and leave the exchanger shell and flanged connections intact. This is achieved by removing the bolted head and tube sheet brace and cutting the seal ring weld at the periphery of the tube sheet. The bundle is then lifted out of the shell by the overhead crane.

Reactor building. The building that houses the reactor plant will be airtight and will serve as a containment for radioactive gases, which may be released during maintenance. The building's air will be monitored and filtered, and it will be vented to the exhaust stack.

Space is provided outside the reactor plant for an off-gas building stack, gas and vapor holders, gas handling building, hot laboratory, and shops, waste handling building, and chemical processing buildings. Both hot components and blanket assemblies are transported from the reactor building to the far end of the bay by a low U-frame traveling crane. At the end of the bay, they are transferred to an overhead crane running perpendicular to the bay and transported to either of the two buildings. With this arrangement, hot materials may be transferred entirely underwater, thereby eliminating the need for bulky shielding and mobile cooling systems.

Maintenance considerations: A study of the problem of maintenance of a large-scale homogeneous reactor indicated the following. It appears impossible to accomplish some repair operations remotely in place and under 20 ft of water. Experience to date tends to indicate that the repair of radioactive equipment may be so difficult that it will be uneconomical to repair anything except such small components as valves and pumps. The larger defective components must be removed from the system and a replacement installed. The repairs, if possible, can then be made in a “hot machine shop after the system is back in operation.

Extensive use of jigs and fixtures in performing maintenance work will be necessary for rapid and safe work. All jigs and fixtures should be designed and constructed before the plant is put into operation. In many cases, it will be advantageous to use the jigs during initial construction to ensure that they function properly.

The estimated annual maintenance cost for a plant of the size considered is approximately $3,300,000, which includes the capital investment in maintenance equipment. This amounts to about 4 mills/kWh at a 60% capacity factor or ~3 mills/kWh at an 80% capacity factor. The 150,000-kW nuclear power plant described is estimated to cost $375.

Started for a two-region multipurpose intermediate-scale homogeneous reactor as an alternative to the single-region reactors previously studied. Several suggested core vessel arrangements for two-region converters were presented. In all designs, the core shape approximates a 4-ft-diameter sphere, and a central thimble is incorporated to permit startup and shutdown with a full core containing the operating concentration of fuel. The major interest in the design of this type of reactor is the possibility of converting thorium into U5 in the blanket region of the reactor.

The first design involved a 1350-MW (heat) power plant containing three reactors. Each of these operated at 450 MW to produce a net of 105 MW of electricity. The design of this plant, which is reviewed in the following paragraphs, is representative of the technology as of September 1953.

In the proposed arrangement, three large cells are provided for the reactors and associated high-pressure equipment, and a fourth is provided for the dump tanks and low-pressure equipment. Each reactor cell is divided into compartments for the reactor, heat exchanger, pumps, and gas circulating systems. Radiation from the cells is reduced to tolerable levels under operating conditions by concrete shielding. The individual compartments have sufficient shielding to permit limited access when equipment is being replaced.

Each reactor consists of a 6-ft-diameter spherical core, operated at a power of 320 MW (100 kW/liter), surrounded by a 2-ft-thick blanket in which sulfate (dissolved in D2O) is circulated through the core at a rate of 30,000 gpm under a pressure of 1000 psia. Fluid enters the core at 213°C and leaves at 250°C. Decomposition of the D2O moderator by fission fragments yields 240 cfm of gas containing 28 mole % De, 14 mole % Og, and 58 mole % D2O.

Liquid leaving the core divides into two parallel circuits, each at 15,000 gpm, which lead into centrifugal gas separators. There, the explosive mixture of deuterium and oxygen is separated from the liquid and diluted below the explosive limit with a recirculated gas stream, which contains oxygen, helium, and D2O. The gas-free liquid circulates through heat exchangers and is returned to the core by canned-motor circulating pumps. Steam is produced in the exchangers at 215 psig and 388°F.

The gas streams from the separators are joined and flow into a high-pressure storage tank, accompanied by about 500 gpm of entrained liquid. After the entrainment is removed in mist separators for return to the liquid system, the Dz and Oz are recombined when the gas passes into a catalyst bed containing platinized alumina pellets. Heat liberated in the recombiner increases the temperature of the gas from 250 to 464°C. The hot gases are cooled to 250°C in a gas condenser, which has a capacity of 20 MW and condenses Dz at a rate of about 89 gpm. The gas is recirculated to the gas separators by an oxygen blower.

Similar gas- and liquid-recirculating systems are used to remove heat from the blanket, which consists of a thorium-oxide slurry in D2O containing 500 to 1000 ppm Th/liter. The slurry is recirculated by means of a 12,400-gpm canned-motor pump through a gas separator and through a 130-MW heat exchanger.

The reactor is pressurized with a mixture of helium and oxygen, which is admitted as required. It is expected that most of the fission-product gases will be retained in the high-pressure gas-circulating systems, with only whatever small, daily letdown is required to adjust the pressures. Calculations for a similar system indicate that enough Xe135 will be transferred into the gas stream to reduce the xenon poisoning in the reactor by a factor of 5 to 10.

The reactor plant consists of a space 80 ft wide, 300 ft long, and 45 ft above ground level. At one end of the structure is located a storage pool for items freshly removed from the shield. A gantry crane services the reactors, and its runway extends a distance beyond the shield for access to the pool and to provide lay-down space for a reactor-shield tank dome. Three cylindrical shield tanks are provided to contain each reactor and components.

In the event of a line rupture or equipment failure resulting in gross leakage of reactor fluids from the reactor system, no radioactive material capable of withstanding 50 psig will be allowed to escape beyond the reactor building. Eight feet of concrete are poured around this tank to a height of 45 ft 6 in. above ground level for biological shielding.

As shown in Figure-13, each of the container buildings has an access hatch. Items such as circulating pumps, pressurizer heater elements, evaporators, etc. , for which the probability of maintenance is high, are grouped on one side of the shield and more or less under this hatch for servicing. No specific procedure for repairing or replacing equipment was developed; however, consideration was given to both wet and dry maintenance methods.

Homogeneous reactor experiment No. 3. In 1957, conceptual design studies of HRE-3, a two-region homogeneous breeder reactor fueled with uranium and thorium, were initiated at the Oak Ridge National Laboratory. This reactor, operating at 60 MW of heat to produce approximately 19 MW of electrical energy, will be designed to provide operational and technical data and to demonstrate the technical feasibility of an intermediate-scale aqueous homogeneous power breeder. The power plant will be a completely integrated facility incorporating (1) the nuclear reactor complex, (2) the electrical generating plant, and (3) the nuclear fuel recycle processing plant. Preliminary design criteria are given in Table 9-10.

As presently conceived, the reactor will be of the two-region type with a heavy-water uranyl-sulfate solution being circulated through the inner (core) region, where 50 MW of heat is produced. The fuel solution and slurry will be circulated through separate steam generators by the use of canned-motor pumps. The fuel heat exchanger will provide, and the slurry heat exchanger will provide 39,100 lb/hr of saturated steam at 450 psia (450°F) at 10-MW blanket power. The blanket and core regions, operating at 1500 psia and 275°C and 280°C average temperatures, respectively, require heat exchanger surfaces that are resistant to corrosion by the circulating fluids.

Respectively, are interconnected in the vapor region. Inasmuch as oxygen is consumed by mechanisms of corrosion and must be added continuously, it is currently favored as the pressurizing medium to provide the overpressure necessary to prevent boiling and bubble formation. Sufficient homogeneous catalysts will be provided in the solution and slurry to recombine all the radiolytic gases formed in the circulating system during operation. In this manner, it will be unnecessary to operate with continuous letdown of slurry and/or solution. Purge water for use in the high-pressure circulating systems will be produced by condensing a portion of the steam contained in the vapor volume of the pressurizer. Advantage is taken of the beta and gamma decay energy to maintain the pressurizers at a slightly higher temperature than the remaining portion of the system.

The electrical generating plant will be essentially of conventional design. The 20-MW turbine will operate at 1800 rpm on 450 psia saturated steam with moisture separation equipment provided. The condensing water requirements are 31,300 gpm, assuming the water enters at 70°F and leaves at 80°F. The generating voltage of 13. 8 kV is sufficient to permit direct connection to an existing distribution system.

The fuel reprocessing for HRE-3 will consist of concentrating insoluble fission and corrosion products in the underflow pots of hydroclone separators, recovery of uranium from the hydroclone underflow by UO2 precipitation, and recovery of D2O by evaporation. The slurry processing operation will consist of D2O recovery by evaporation and packaging the thorium nitrate solution, which will be converted to ThO2 before being returned to the blanket of the reactor.

The maintenance philosophy of the reactor complex has not yet been established. However, it can be said that the reactor system will be designed so that all components and equipment will be capable of being removed and replaced, but with varying degrees of difficulty. The choice of underwater, dry, or combination thereof maintenance techniques has not been made. The major components of HRE-3 are considered to be in the range of sizes which might be used in a large-scale Thorium Breeder Power Plant.

Relation between cost studies and reactor design factors. The power cost associated with a reactor station may be subdivided into fixed charges, operating and maintenance costs, and fuel costs. Fixed charges include interest on investment, depreciation, and taxes. Fuel costs include both variable and fixed chemical processing costs, cost of feed materials, and inventory charges. Because of the uncertainty of these items, it is impossible to determine absolute costs for nuclear power until large nuclear plants have been built and operated.

Aqueous homogeneous reactors have certain features, such as high neutron economy and continuous fission-product removal, which make them appear to be potential economic power producers. However, as with all water-moderated reactors, to attain steam temperatures corresponding to thermal efficiencies of 25 to 30%, circulating aqueous systems require operating pressures between 1000 and 2000 psia. Since thermal efficiency increases relatively slowly with increasing operating pressure, while reactor costs rise relatively sharply above pressures of about 1500 psi, it is unlikely that reactors will be operated at pressures above 2000 psia. In addition, increasing the reactor temperature tends to decrease the breeding ratio, which adversely affects fuel costs.

In order to optimize the design of a homogeneous reactor of a given power output and pressure, it is necessary to know how both the fixed and operating costs vary with the dimensions of the reactor core and pressure vessel. In this regard, one must take into consideration that the maximum diameter of the pressure vessel will be limited by fabrication problems, and the minimum diameter of the core vessel will be limited by corrosion problems. For each combination of core- and pressure-vessel diameters within these limits, there will be a minimum fuel cost resulting from a balance of inventory costs, processing costs, and fuel-feed costs; these latter costs are determined by the breeding ratio, which is a function of fuel concentration and processing rate.

Although the fuel-fluid temperature influences power costs, this is normally limited by the properties of the fuel system or by the above-mentioned pressure limitations rather than by economic considerations. However, the temperature range established on this basis is also close to that which gives minimum fuel costs. In addition, the power level of the reactor is usually assumed to be constant, although it is realized that this is a very important factor influencing the cost of power since plant investment charges per unit power constitute a large fraction of the power cost and change appreciably with power level. The effect of power level on capital costs is discussed in Section 10-8 and on fuel costs in sections as noted.

The operating and maintenance costs, as well as plant investment costs, are a function of reactor type and method of maintenance. However, the exact form of some of the interrelations between design variables is not known at the present time. However, because of the lack of information, most economic studies do not consider such differences but assume investment and maintenance charges to be determined primarily by the reactor power level. The results of such studies are still significant if they are considered in the light of the assumptions used as more cost data are accumulated; the results can be modified as required.

With respect to fuel cycle costs, established Atomic Energy Commission prices for thorium, natural uranium, U3O8, and Pu89, and the schedule of charges for uranium of varying enrichments provide a basis for cost calculations. Charges for various chemical conversion steps and for processing spent fuel in a multipurpose chemical plant have also been announced. Although these charges are applicable to the processing of aqueous fuels, the possibility of including on-site processing facilities as part of the homogeneous reactor complex must also be considered since this would have an effect on the reactor design.

10-1. 2 Parametric cost studies at ORNL. The homogeneous reactor systems considered include one- and two-region reactors, breeders, converters, and burners. Although no one fuel or type of reactor shows a marked advantage in power cost over all the others, the superior fuel utilization of a thorium breeder system suggests that it is potentially the most economical one for power production. Much effort has been devoted to two-region systems primarily because of the relatively high breeding ratio and low fuel inventory obtainable.

Economic evaluations discussed in this chapter are, for the most part, based on a three-reactor station generating a total of 375 MW of electricity, where the required chemical processing facilities are shared by the three reactors. The present choice of reactor dimensions for a given power capability must be based on engineering judgment and the results of fuel cost studies. Based on fuel cost studies, one-region reactors must be large (14- to 15-ft diameter) in order to obtain good neutron economy; two-region systems can have good neutron economy in relatively small sizes (9- to 10-ft overall diameter) but require high concentrations (1000 g/liter) of fertile material in the blanket region. Estimates of near-optimum reactor sizes for different homogeneous systems are based on fuel cost studies in which highly enriched fissionable fuel is valued at $16/g, and inventory charges are 4%. In all cases, it is assumed that the particular fuel system is.

In computing the cost of power, fixed charges on depreciating items such as capital investment, including depreciation, interest, return on investment, insurance, and taxes, are assumed to be 15% per year. Fixed charges on non-depreciating items such as fuel, D20, and fertile materials are assumed to be 4% per year.

10-2. 1 Fuel costs. The fuel costs associated with electrical power produced from reactors include those charges which are due to replacement of conventional fuels with nuclear fuel. The fuel cost is considered to be the sum of the net cost of nuclear-fuel feed inventory charges for fertile material, heavy water, and fuel material losses; variable fuel-processing charges; and fixed charges for fuel processing. Fuel-cost studies are primarily for the purpose of investigating the economic importance of the several parameters. Of these parameters, the most important are core diameter, blanket thickness, fertile-material concentrations in core and blanket, fuel concentration in the blanket, and poison fraction in the core. In studying fuel costs, aqueous homogeneous power reactors are generally assumed to have an 80% load factor and a net thermal-to-electrical efficiency of about 25%. The thermal power level per reactor is considered to be 450 to 500 MW. Thorium (as oxide) is valued at $5/lb with no significant charge for making ThO2-D2O slurry. Heavy water is valued at $28/lb, and highly enriched fissionable uranium at $16/g. The amount of heavy water required is estimated on the basis of the total reactor-system volume and the room-temperature density of heavy water.

5% per year. The volume of the core circulating system is considered as the volume of the core plus an external volume of 1 liter for each 20 kW generated in the core. The cost of natural uranium is assumed to be $40/kg U either as UO3 or UO2-80. The cost of uranium of various enrichments in U-235 is primarily derived from the AEC price schedule or the equations for an ideal gaseous diffusion process. The costs of enrichment and fuel fabrication are factored into the total fuel cycle cost.

Fuel costs are dependent upon the value assigned to plutonium and U3O8. In a power-only economy, the value of these fissionable materials can be no more or less than their fuel value; in these studies, their value was taken to be the same as that for U85, or $16/g. However, if U33 and/or plutonium are assigned different values, the fuel costs can be significantly affected.

The fuel values used in these studies are slightly different from those announced by the AEC. The main difference is associated with the value used for plutonium. However, the effect of various plutonium values on fuel cost is indicated in the section on plutonium producers. The AEC announced prices for nuclear materials are given in Table 10-1.

Since the rate of fuel burnup is small with respect to the inventory of fuel required for criticality, the investment and inventory charge for fuel materials can be appreciable. Unless otherwise specified, inventory charges for uranium, thorium, plutonium, and heavy water are assumed to be 4% of their value per year.

An economic consideration in the design of nuclear power plants is the chemical processing requirement of the spent nuclear fuel. Aqueous homogeneous reactor fuels can be processed by either the Purex or the Thorex process. Both involve solvent extraction and require that the fuels be separated from the D2O for economical processing. The Purex process is used for separating plutonium, uranium, and fission-product poisons, while the Thorex process is used for the separation of thorium, uranium, and fission products. Rather, central processing facilities which serve many reactors are usually assumed to be available.

Note that Eqs. (10-1) and (10-2) take into consideration the effect of throughput of fissionable material as well as fertile material on the variable processing charges in a chemical plant of fixed size. This information is necessary in determining the optimum concentrations of fissionable and fertile material in a reactor of specified dimensions.

The total processing cost in an on-site chemical plant, such as that described above, will be 0.76 mills/kWh plus the variable processing charges and minus the credit for any net fissionable material produced. Thus, the chemical-plant investment costs exert a strong influence on the fuel costs. These costs are lower if a large multipurpose chemical plant is available to handle the fuel instead of the on-site plant. These charges amount to $15,300 per day and apply to a plant having a daily capacity of 1 ton if slightly enriched uranium (less than 3% U235 by weight) is processed or a daily capacity of 88 kg if highly enriched uranium is considered.

Equivalent to $2. 15 per gram of U235 for natural uranium, $0. These values can be compared with those considered previously, namely: $0. 50 per gram of total uranium processed (the enrichment of the uranium in the highly enriched systems is about 50%), and $3. 50 per kilogram of natural or slightly enriched uranium (equivalent to $0. 50 per gram of U235 in natural uranium) plus $1. 00 per gram of plutonium. Thus, in most cases, the AEC total processing charges amount to less than the variable processing charges considered here. In case of a central processing plant, however, it would be necessary to include fuel-shipping charges and charges associated with preparing the processing plant for the specific fuel.

In studying the poisoning effect of fission fragments, three groups of fission-product poisons are considered. The first group consists of gases; the second is composed of nongaseous fission fragments having high microscopic cross sections (greater than 10,000 barns); and the third is made up of nongaseous fission fragments having low microscopic cross sections, which transmute to nuclides having the same low cross section. For processing rates that do not cause excessive variable processing costs, only the third group of poisons is affected by chemical processing. The first group is removed by means other than Thorex or Purex, while the second group attains equilibrium through neutron capture.

In processing U-Pu systems, a 20-day cooling period takes place before processing in a Purex plant. Following complete decontamination, the uranium is permitted to cool for an additional 100 days before being re-enriched in a diffusion plant. This 120-day holdup and also a 30-day feed supply are considered in calculating inventory charges. In processing thoria slurries (core region), the holdup time prior to processing is considered to be 95 days, to permit about 90% of the Pa3 to decay to U3.

In nearly all cases, fuel concentrations required for criticality are obtained using the two-group model, in which all fissions are assumed to occur in the thermal group (see Eqs. 2-7 through 2-10). Resonance capture is assumed to occur only in fertile material and only when neutrons are transferred from the fast to the slow group. For the one-region U-Pu systems, a six-group model is used in the nuclear calculations to allow for the resonance absorptions in uranium and plutonium. Unless otherwise specified, the thermal values for the various etas are 7(U83) = 2. 25.

Knowledge and experience in the design, construction, and operation of nuclear power systems make it difficult to evaluate these costs, and most estimates are based on the expectation that nuclear reactor plants will have lifetimes about as long as those of conventional power plants. A 20-year depreciation rate is assumed for permanent facilities, and a 10-year depreciation rate for all equipment associated with the reactor proper. Preparing a realistic estimate of the cost and the required maintenance of a large homogeneous reactor is particularly difficult, since the equipment must handle large amounts of radioactive material. Little experience has been obtained in manufacturing the required equipment, and generally the costs are based on estimates by manufacturers. These estimated costs of equipment for a specific reactor power are scaled according to the reactor power raised to the 0. 6 power to obtain the variation of investment cost with power level. The annual operating and maintenance charges have been estimated by roughly applying the corresponding charges (based on a percentage of capital investment) in conventional steam plants. These estimates correspond to 3% of the total capital investment per year.

Introduction: Fuel costs are provided for spherical two-region reactors utilizing U233-ThO2-D20 slurry in both the core and blanket regions. Results are also presented for scenarios without thorium in the core and for single-region reactors. In these systems, materials from the core and blanket are presumed to be transferred to a Thorex plant for chemical processing.

Regions and fuel are returned to the core as needed to maintain criticality. The fissionable material produced in excess of that required is considered to be sold. The fuel product is computed to be a mixture of U-233, U-235, and other uranium isotopes, as determined by the isotope equations and the critical equation. The system is assumed to operate under equilibrium conditions. A schematic flowsheet of the chemical processing cycles for a two-region reactor having a solution-type core region is given in Figure 1. The flowsheet for the one-region system would be similar to that for the blanket of the two-region system, except that processed fuel and thoria would be returned to the single region.

In the processing cycle shown in Figure 1, essentially two methods of removing fission-product poisons are considered. One is the removal of precipitated solids by hydraulic cyclones (hydroclones), which removes insoluble fission products from the reactor in a cycle time of about a day.

By processing the fluid in a Thorium processing plant, processing by hydroclones can be done only with suitable fuels. The associated cycle time is so short that fission products removed by this method can be considered to be eliminated from the reactor as soon as they are formed. Thorium processing, although removing all fission products that pass through, is much more costly than hydroclone processing.

The essential difference between the processing cycle shown in -1 and that for solid-fuel reactors is associated with the continuous removal of fission-product gases and of insoluble fission products (in solution reactors). Fuel and fertile material processed by Thorex would undoubtedly be removed from the reactor on a semi-batch basis.

The three groups of fission-product poisons considered previously are not all affected by Thorex processing. Group-1 poisons (the fission-product gases) are assumed to be physically removed before processing, while group-2 poisons (non-gaseous nuclei having high cross sections) are effectively removed by neutron capture within the reactor system (a fraction of these nuclei is of the order of 10,000 barns). The macroscopic cross section of these two groups of poisons is taken as 1. 8% of the fission cross section. Of this, 0. 8% is due to non-gaseous high-cross-section nuclei, while 1% is due to the gaseous high-cross-section nuclei. However, for reactors containing a fuel solution, the non-soluble group-3 poisons are assumed to be removed by hydroclone separation. The charge for hydroclones operating on a one-day cycle is taken as 0. 03 mill/kwh, based upon a charge of $75/day per reactor. In these circumstances, only 25% of the generated group-3 poisons are removed by the Thorex process.

The parameter ranges covered in the spherical reactor calculations are given in Table 10-2. Values used for 73 and resonance escape probability are presently accepted values; however, in a few cases, they were varied in order to estimate how the results are affected by these changes.

Two-region spherical reactors: Concentration of U3 in the blanket and core poison fraction. The optimum values of these variables are found to be largely independent of other parameters; moreover, there is little change in fuel cost with changes in either blanket or poison concentration.

Fuel cost as a function of blanket thickness for various blanket thorium concentrations; Power per reactor = 480 MW (heat), core diameter = 5 ft.

For all slurry-core systems, the optimum poison fraction is about 0. 08, independent of the other design parameters. 07. The lowest fuel cost occurs at a blanket U concentration of about 4. 0 g/kg thorium.

Blanket thickness and blanket thorium concentration. An example of the effects of these parameters on fuel cost is presented in Figure 2 for a slurry-core reactor. The blanket thickness giving the lowest fuel cost lies between 2 and 2. 5 ft. As is expected, higher thorium loadings are desirable if thin blankets are necessary on the basis of other considerations. Systems having low concentrations of thorium in the core require more heavily loaded blankets to minimize fuel costs. For solution cores, still heavier and thicker blankets are desirable, particularly if the core diameters are small.

Core thorium and core diameter: The effects of these variables on fuel costs are shown in Figure 3. These results indicate that based on fuel cost alone, small solution-core reactors with a ThO2 concentration of zero have a slight advantage over slurry reactors. However, the power density at the core wall ranges between 160 and 300 kW/liter for such reactors operating at the specified power level of 480 thermal MW. If larger cores are necessary due to power-density restrictions, the fuel-cost advantage shifts to the slurry core. The slurry-core systems produce higher outputs of generated fuel, although all the reactors depicted have breeding ratios exceeding unity. As demonstrated in Figure 3, the minimum fuel cost is approximately 1. 2 mills/kWh, irrespective of core diameter. The hydroclone installation adds merely 0. 03 mill/kWh in investment cost to the system, while the variable ThOrex processing cost is reduced by two-thirds, leading to the decrease in fuel costs as indicated. Similar compensating effects explain the insensitivity of fuel costs to variations in other design parameters.

Reactor power. The above results are based on the concept of a three-reactor station of 1440-thermal-MW capacity, each reactor producing 125 MW of electricity. The effect of varying power alone is shown in Table 10-4. The fuel cost is found to be a strong function of power capability. The greater part of the change is due to variation in the fixed. Since the total fixed processing cost ($5500/day) is assumed to be independent of throughput, this charge on a mills/kWh basis is inversely proportional to the reactor power.

Nuclear parameters. The values of n(U3) and the resonance escape probability of thorium-oxide slurries are not known with certainty. Therefore, the effects of changes in these parameters on the results were computed to examine the reliability of the nuclear calculations. The fuel cost increases by about 0. 2 mill/kwh if 723 is changed from 2. 25 to 2. 18, and is reduced by about the same amount if the 73 value is taken to be 0. 24 instead of 0. 26. Fuel-cycle analysis. The fuel-cycle analysis was based on a simple model that assumed constant enrichment and burnup throughout the cycle. Fuel-cost analysis. Economic analysis. Conclusions.

The importance of resonance escape probability for thoria-D2O slurries (p°) on fuel cost was studied by using values for (1 — p°), which are 20% higher or lower than a standard value. With a core thorium concentration of about 200 g/liter, the changes in p% have a negligible effect on fuel cost. 05 mill/kWh.

Xenon removal. For most of the cases studied, the contribution of xenon to the poison fraction is assumed to be 0. 01. To achieve this condition, about 80% of the xenon must be removed before neutron capture occurs. Since xenon-removal systems for slurries have not been demonstrated to date, the effect of operating without xenon removal was studied by increasing the xenon poison fraction to 0. 05 (the samarium contribution cost also increased by approximately the same amount). The values in Table 10-5 illustrate this effect by comparing two cases at optimum total poison fraction, but at different xenon poison levels. Thus, the variable part of the core poison fraction (and the core processing rate) remains about the same. The higher fuel cost at the higher xenon level appears to be almost entirely a result of the reduction in breeding ratio.

Between 200 and 275 g/liter. The lowest fuel cost is about 1. 76 mills/kWh (for a 14-ft-diameter reactor containing 270 g Th/liter). In the curve for the 14-ft reactor, the inflection in the neighborhood of 225 g Th/liter is a result of the reactor changing from a breeder to a nonbreeder.

Power and nuclear parameters. The effect of reactor power on the fuel costs of one-region reactors is similar to that mentioned earlier for two-region systems. For example, if the total fuel cost for a three-reactor station is 1. 76 mills/kWh at 125 MW of electric capability per reactor, it would be only 1.

10-3. 4 Cylindrical reactors. The effects of geometry on fuel cost are due to the associated changes in inventory requirements and breeding ratio. Accompanying these effects are changes in the average power densities and the wall power densities within the reactor. Because of corrosion difficulties associated with high power densities, it is desirable to operate with reasonably large reactor volumes. Cylindrical geometry permits reactors to have large volumes without necessitating large reactor diameters.

One-region spherical reactors would have to be large to prevent excessive neutron leakage, resulting in lower power densities (average power densities of about 30 kW/liter). Closure problems concerning maintenance of an inside vessel would not exist. Therefore, there is little incentive to increase reactor volume by employing cylindrical geometry for one-region homogeneous reactors.

For two-region reactors, cylindrical geometry may prove advantageous with respect to feasibility and relative ease of reactor maintenance. However, the associated larger fuel inventories (in comparison to inventories for spherical geometry) will increase fuel costs. 2 mill/kwh greater than does spherical geometry if in either case there were no restrictions on core-wall power density.

Fuel costs in uranium-plutonium systems will depend on whether the plutonium is removed continually or allowed to remain in the reactor. Studies have been made on the basis of either maintaining plutonium uniformly within the reactor or removing the plutonium immediately after its formation by means of hydroclones. In addition, the effect upon fuel costs of adding Li2SO4 to UO2SO4 solutions is shown. The additive serves to suppress two-phase separation of the UO2SO4 solution and permits reactor operation at temperatures higher than would otherwise be possible.

10-4. 1 One-region PuO2-UOs-D2O power reactors. Fuel costs of one-region homogeneous power reactors fueled with PuO2-UO3-D2O higher isotopes are assumed to be removed in the fuel processing step or to have zero absorption cross-section. Although large reactors require feed enrichments equal to or less than that of natural uranium, minimum fuel costs are obtained when the reactor wastes are re-enriched in a diffusion plant. In the reactor system considered, the plutonium produced is fed back as reactor fuel after recovery in a Purex plant. The separated uranium is recycled to a diffusion plant for enrichment. Since in all cases the breeding ratio is less than unity, the additional fuel requirement is met by uranium feed of an enrichment dictated by the operating conditions. As a result of the feedback of plutonium, the concentration of plutonium in the reactor is high enough for resonance absorptions and fissions to have an appreciable effect upon fuel concentrations.

The fuel cycle is shown in Figure 5. Slurry is removed from the reactor at the rate required to maintain a specified poison level. The fuel is separated from the D2O, cooled for 20 days while the neptunium decays, and partially decontaminated in a Purex plant. Part of the fuel is then sent directly to the reactor feed-preparation equipment. The uranium is completely decontaminated, stored for 100 days until the U-37 decays, and sent to the diffusion plant. A 30-day reserve of reactor feed is kept on hand.

Of several hundred grams per liter. The addition of Li2SO4 in molar concentration equal to that of the uranium increases the temperature at which phase separation appears and also acts as a corrosion inhibitor for stainless steel. Because of the high neutron-capture cross-section of natural lithium, high isotopic purity in Li is necessary.

All plutonium is assumed to remain either in solution or uniformly suspended throughout the reactor. The plutonium is returned to the reactor following fuel processing, and steady-state conditions are assumed. The same type of fuel cycle as shown in -5 is considered. The results shown in -6 are for spherical reactors operated at an average temperature of 330°C, producing 1000 MW of thermal energy, and delivering 300 MW of electricity to a power grid. The variable fuel costs given do not include fixed charges for fuel processing; these fixed charges would add about 0. 76 mill/kWh to the fuel costs given.

Inventory charge and $28/lb D20. Table 10-7 gives a breakdown of costs for several reactors near optimum conditions. The Li cost is assumed to be $100/lb; at this value, the effect of lithium cost upon fuel cost is negligible. However, the added Li2SO4 acts as a neutron poison and diluent, which lowers the conversion ratio. These effects increase fuel costs by 0. 2 to 0. 3 mill/kWh over those which would exist if no Li2SO4 were required.

The above results are for equilibrium conditions, with continuous fuel processing. Therefore, any economic advantage associated with batch operation can exist only if fixed charges for fuel processing (or storage) at the end of batch operation are effectively lower than fixed charges associated with continuous processing. Fuel costs are given below for spherical one-region reactors operating on a batch basis, utilizing an initial loading of slightly enriched uranium. In all cases, fuel feed is highly enriched U95. The total reactor power is 480 thermal Mw (125 electrical Mw), and an 0. 8 load factor is considered. Inventory charges are 4% per year, the cost of D2O is $28/lb, and the cost of uranium as a function of enrichment is based on official prices. A summary of the fuel costs is given in Table 10-8 for 6-ft-diameter reactors. More details for two reactors are given in Table 10-9. Credit for plutonium is based on a fuel value of $16/g; it is assumed that plutonium will remain within the reactor. The shipping costs do not include fixed charges on shipping containers.

For these reactors (6-ft diameter), the addition of Li2SO4 (99. 98% Li) (cases 5, 6, and 7) to the fuel solution raises the fuel cost slightly, the maximum increase being about 0.1 mill/kWh. The use of hydrocyclones (cases 8 and 9) for partial poison removal (assuming no plutonium recovery) for these reactors shows an economic advantage, particularly in the "throwaway fuel costs (no uranium or plutonium recovery). " For these latter costs, the removal of fission-product poisons reduces the fuel costs by 0.3. The economic feasibility of hydrocyclones in these circumstances, in a power-only economy, is dependent upon the savings effected by poison removal relative to the costs associated with recovery of the plutonium for fuel for 20-year operation.

10-4. 3 Two-region UO3-PuO2-D2O power reactors. The major advantage associated with two-region reactors is that good neutron economy can be combined with relatively low inventory requirements. None of the uranium-plutonium-fueled aqueous homogeneous reactors have been designed for power production.

In a power converter, the plutonium is extracted from the blanket and fed to the core as fuel material. Natural uranium is fed to the blanket, and the plutonium formed is extracted by Purex processing. By adjusting the concentrations of fissionable materials in the blanket, the net rate of production of plutonium in the blanket is made equal to the consumption in the core. The fuel cycle considered for a two-region reactor is shown in Figure 7.

Purex plant to maintain a constant poison fraction. Uranium from the blanket is also processed through the Purex plant; the rate of processing is governed by the required plutonium feed to the core. Although it is possible to operate the reactors without an enriching plant by using natural-uranium feed to the blanket and discarding the waste, there appears to be a slight cost advantage in operating the reactors in conjunction with an enriching plant.

Table 10-10 gives fuel costs and associated information for a two-region reactor having a core diameter of 6 ft and an overall diameter of 10 ft. The one-region reactors of 12 to 14 ft diameter indicate that two-region U-Pu reactors have fuel costs about 0.2 to 0.

Since plutonium is quite insoluble in UO2SO4-D2O solutions and can be removed by hydroclones, it is possible to produce high-quality plutonium (PuO2 content less than 2%). 50/g for conversion to metal. At this value, it is more economical to recover plutonium than to burn it as fuel. Fuel costs based on the recovery of the plutonium are given here for one- and two-region U-Pu reactors. 46/kWh with no plutonium recovery and $0. 39/kWh with plutonium recovery. For a two-region U-Pu reactor, assuming 20% enrichment in uranium and 15% burnup in the first region and 40% enrichment and 60% burnup in the second region, the fuel cost is $0.

Because of the high credit for plutonium, the fuel costs are negative even if the fixed charges for chemical processing (0. 76 mill/kWh) are included. The total fuel costs obtained are shown as -8. The effect of the Li2SO4 addition is to decrease the conversion ratio because of the relatively high value assigned to plutonium. This causes the Li2SO4 addition (added in the same molal concentration as the UO2SO4) to increase fuel costs by 0. 8 mill/kWh over those if no Li2SO4 were required.

Calculations indicate that batch-type operation of a plutonium producer is undesirable if plutonium has a value of $40/g, as any savings in fuel processing costs using batch-type operation are more than compensated by a loss in product value associated with the decrease in plutonium production.

Two-region reactors. Since the conversion ratio is greater in a two-region reactor, it is expected that a high plutonium value will cause this reactor type to have lower fuel costs (greater fuel credits) than a one-region reactor.

The results of fuel-cost studies for spherical one-region reactors containing dilute, highly enriched UO2SOxz in either D20 or H20 are given in Table 10-12. The noble gases are assumed to be removed continuously. The removal of poisons and corrosion products by hydroclones is considered, but the fuel cost is about the same whether hydroclones are used or not, assuming corrosion rates of about 1 mil/year.

With D2O reactors, it appears that fuel processing can be economically eliminated if the reactor operating cycle is about 10 years and if the spent fuel is disposed of cheaply at the reactor site. Such a procedure with the H2O-moderated reactor is more expensive because of higher uranium inventory. For low fuel-shipping and -processing charges, the fuel costs are nearly independent of the reactor size and moderator, and are about 4 mills/kwh. If fixed charges associated with fuel processing are greater than ~0.5 mill/kwh, it may be more economical to store the fuel than to have it processed.

10-7. 2 Nonsteady-state operating conditions. A comparison of fuel costs is given here for several one-region reactor systems operating under nonsteady-state conditions. The reactors are moderated with either H2O or, in the UO3+ ThOsz system, it is assumed that the initial fuel is U233 and that sufficient U5 is available as feed material.

Cost factors which make only a small contribution to the total fuel cost are fuel processing losses (0. 2% of fuel processed), D2O losses (5% of D2O inventory per year), hydroclone costs ($70/day), 30-day inventory supplies, and shipping charges (it is assumed that the amortization charges for shipping costs are negligible). In all cases, the inventory charges are based on the volume of the reactor vessel plus the volume of the external system.

Only the optimal or near-optimal reactor conditions are given in -9. The optimal conditions refer to the diameter, fuel-processing cycle time, and fertile-material concentration, which give the minimum fuel cost of all the diameters, cycle times, and fertile-material concentrations studied for the particular case.

A value of unity for relative fuel processing implies a charge of $0. 54/g fertile material processed. A value of two implies processing charges twice the above values. Fixed charges for chemical processing are not included in the calculation of fuel cost. A relative poisoning of unity implies representation of the fission-product poisons by two effective nuclei having yields of 0. 11 and 1. 81 atoms/fission and thermal absorption cross-sections. A value of 1/2 implies cross-sections 1/2 the above values, corresponding closely to the values of Walker.

Fuel costs were calculated for both 10 and 25 years of reactor operation. These costs are usually slightly lower after 25 years than after 10 years, but the differences are small, usually between 0 and 0. 1 mill/kWh. Therefore, only results for 10-year operation are given here.

The reactor system and power level influence the fuel cost as indicated in -9. Changing the power level affects optimum reactor conditions significantly. The variations in relative poisons and relative chemical processing considered here did not change fuel costs to a large degree, the individual effects usually being about 0. 1 mill/kWh. The influence of reactor composition on fuel cost is due to the values of 7 for the various fissionable materials and fraction poisons associated with the different systems. Increasing the inventory charge from 4 to 12% increases fuel cost by about 0. 5 mill/kWh for the D2O systems. 1 mill/kWh.

The influences of fuel-processing rate, fuel-processing charge, and fission-product poisoning upon fuel cost are shown in Figure 10 for the UO3-ThO2-D2O system.

The fuel costs given in Figs. 10-9 and 10-10 include no fixed charges for fuel processing; the magnitude of these charges would be dependent upon the number of reactors processed by the processing plant. Increasing the fuel-processing charges decreases the optimum fuel-processing rate. Although fuel would undoubtedly be processed at the end of reactor operation (and this was always assumed in obtaining the results), the permissible unit cost for processing at that time is high compared with the permissible unit cost associated with a high processing rate. If the fixed charges for processing correspond only to that period required to process the fuel (for a given processing-plant capacity), then the optimum processing rate is less than the rate obtained on the basis of fixed charges being independent of fuel processing rate.

The homogeneous reactors that have been built are small and have investment costs of over $1000/electrical kW. The capital costs of large nuclear plants, based largely on paper studies, have been estimated to be 1. 2 to 2 times that of conventional power-cost investments. If capital costs are $400/kW, corresponding fixed charges are 9 mills/kW at 80% load factor and 12 mills/kW at 60% load factor, considering a 15% annual fixed charge. It follows that one of the conditions necessary for low-cost power is a high load factor. The essential problems are to achieve low fuel costs and to obtain reliability and long plant lifetime. To date, little experience has been obtained in operating power reactors; therefore, it is difficult to estimate accurately the lifetime and also the reactor reliability over that lifetime. Although most economic studies are used to measure the relative economic advantage of different types of reactors, this cannot be firmly established so long as the investment and maintenance costs remain uncertain. Consequently, no hard and fast conclusions concerning power costs can be obtained other than what the ultimate power cost might be.

The initial cost of the reactor building and other buildings associated with the plant, as well as the site development costs, are strongly influenced by the philosophy behind the design with regard to such factors as safety and security. Estimates for these costs are usually based on corresponding costs for a large conventional steam power plant. Land costs for nuclear plants are extravagantly high if containment is not assured. The cost of containment vessels has been estimated to be in the range of $10 to $40 per electrical kW. Equipment costs usually assume that the desired equipment has been developed and all development costs paid for. Even so, the depreciation charges on reactor equipment may be considerably higher than those for conventional power plants. Also, the insurance costs for a nuclear plant may be much higher.

Conceptual designs for one- and two-region homogeneous reactors consider stainless steel and stainless-steel-clad carbon steel as materials of construction. Either type of reactor will require pressure vessels, gas separators, steam generators, recombiners, sealed motors, pumps, storage vessels, valves, and piping.

Engineering considerations place limits upon the operating pressure and the size of the pressure shell. A spherical reactor shape is desirable, inasmuch as the neutron leakage and the required shell thickness for a given reactor diameter are thus minimized for a given reactor volume. Fabricators of pressure vessels agree that even though very large shells can be made, the smaller diameter vessels are more feasible. Because of the temperature limitation associated with the pressure limitation, saturated steam at relatively low pressures is generated in the heat exchangers.

Although analyses of the turbine plant indicate that thermal efficiency improves as throttle pressure increases, the reactor system investment costs rise sharply with increased operating pressure. The effect of saturated steam temperature upon turbine plant cost and net station efficiencies is significant.

In estimating reactor plant costs, it is necessary to determine the cost of the various items of equipment. The equipment costs are based on per-pound costs of HRE-2 equipment, cost estimates obtained from the industry, and the assumption that costs are directly proportional to reactor power. The effect of station size upon reactor station costs is estimated in Table 10-15, while the possible effect of technical advances upon capital investment costs is indicated in Table 10-12. In all these estimates, a developed and operable system is postulated.

Because of the high level of radioactivity associated with nuclear plants, maintenance and repair of nuclear systems will have to be done remotely. This type of operation is, in general, more time-consuming and expensive than methods used in maintaining conventional coal-fired power plants. To minimize operating and maintenance (O&M) costs, it will be necessary to design reactor plants so as to simplify maintenance problems; however, construction costs associated with such design will be higher than the costs of building a reactor plant in which O&M costs are not so economically significant.

To be able to inspect, repair, or replace components in a high radiation field, this requires component compartmentalization and accessibility. Operating and maintenance costs cannot be predicted accurately because of the lack of knowledge and experience; however, the information available indicates that O&M costs may run as high as 4 mills/kwh in the first plants constructed. Difficulties associated with predicting O&M costs concern predicting component lifetimes, component repair/discard ratio, maintenance procedures, and downtime required for maintenance. Also, detailed design studies of various maintenance schemes are required before these various schemes can be fully evaluated. Based on present technology and a feasible reactor system, it is estimated that these costs will be 2 to 4 mills/kwh.

As more experience is gained in maintaining plants and in designing for O&M, it is expected that these costs will decrease. Even so, because of the nature of the problems, O&M costs in future plants will probably be 1 to 2 mills/kWh, or about two or three times those associated with a conventional coal-fired plant.

The power cost is the sum of fixed charges on capital investment, fuel costs, and operating and maintenance costs. Figure 10-13 specifies the reactor systems considered, along with typical fuel concentrations and reactor dimensions. Estimates of the power cost for these systems are given in Table 10-16, based on operation at 280°C and a power level of 125 electrical MW (500 thermal MW).

The design power of a reactor plant will markedly influence power costs, primarily because the investment cost per unit power is a function of power level. Table 10-17 indicates the influence of power level on power costs by comparing costs for U85 burner-type reactors having power outputs of 125 and 10 electrical MW, respectively.
