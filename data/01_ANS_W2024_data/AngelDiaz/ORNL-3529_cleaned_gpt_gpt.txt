Major effort on the mechanical and process design of the MSRE continued to be on the revision of drawings to incorporate recent results of development work and to facilitate the fabrication and construction work. An overflow tank for installation beneath the fuel pump bowl in the pump furnace is being designed to replace the overflow line that was to have been installed between the fuel pump and the fuel drain line.

The layout of the instrumentation and control system remains essentially the same as previously reported. One new panel was added, four panels were relocated, and the thermocouple routing was revised. Locations for personnel radiation monitors were established.

Except for those items required by recent revisions, preparation of specifications, and initiation of procurement of process instrument components were completed. Most of these components are now on hand, and delivery of the remainder is expected within the next three months.

Installation is progressing in all areas. Installation of reactor equipment and auxiliaries in the reactor cell, drain tank cell, and coolant cell is approximately 40% complete. Auxiliary equipment outside these cells is being installed by a contractor, and their work is approximately 10% complete.

The test on the prototype cooling bayonets for removing after-heat from the MSRE drain tank was terminated after 2600 temperature cycles (1300 ~ 212°F) because of a leak in the steam system. The test was equivalent to several years of operation in the MSRE. Severe thermal fatigue cracking was found in both Inconel tubes of the bayonet, particularly near the weldments for the centering spacer bars. A prototype bayonet of an improved design was constructed of INOR-8 for further testing.

A prototype drain-tank heater was operated for 2876 hours at 1200°F average temperature without mechanical difficulty. The electrical circuitry that connects the individual heater elements was changed to permit separate control of the upper and lower zones of the heater, thus obtaining a more even temperature distribution.

Measurements in the test loop of the helium purification system indicated complete removal of oxygen, with inlet concentrations of up to 225 ppm. However, a breakthrough occurred at 100 ppm after the titanium bed reached 15% of saturation while operating at 1000°F. Further tests will be run with the bed at 1200°F. An electrolytic oxygen analyzer was tested and found to agree within 10% with the results of mass spectrometer analysis.

The fabrication of the sampler-enricher system mockup and its installation into the engineering test loop was completed, and testing was started. A sample was successfully isolated and removed from the pump bowl and transferred to the Analytical Chemistry Laboratory for analysis. The entire procedure required 3 hours, which is acceptable. The flanged disconnects for use on part of the reactor sample transfer tube were successfully assembled. The motor-operated valves that isolate the sampler from the fuel pump bowl were received, and tests indicated that the leak rates through the valves were acceptable. Final design has started on the fuel loop sampler-enricher.

The Engineering Test Loop (ETL) was placed in operation with fuel salt after two oxide additions and removals by HF treatment had been performed on the flush salt, and after the fuel salt had been treated with HF and H2 in the drain tank. Seventy-two percent of the oxygen from the first addition and eighty percent of the oxygen from the second addition were collected as water in the cold traps of the off-gas line during the treatment of the flush salt. The equivalent of 625 ppm oxygen was removed from the fuel salt during 168 hours of treatment with HF and H2. Examination of the kinetics of the water stripping indicated that continuous treatment with HF was not necessary, since the time-consuming step in the process was the resolution of the precipitated oxide to make it available to the HF. Agitation by bubbling with H2 and helium was sufficient to redissolve the precipitate after the concentration was reduced below saturation by short periods of.

After 2000 hours of operation with fuel salt at 1200°F and with salt in the graphite access joint molten, the loop was drained, cooled, and opened at the access joint to remove samples of solids that were deposited at the liquid-gas interface. The solids, while apparently free of UO2, contained corrosion products and crystals of the salt that was formed by selective freezing of the lithium, beryllium, and zirconium fluoride phases. The apparent corrosion rate was initially higher than that during previous operation with the flush salt; however, by the end of the period, the rate was back to normal.

Study of the xenon distribution throughout the MSRE system was continued, and preliminary results of an experiment to determine the xenon-removal rate at the pump bowl indicated that at reduced salt flow rates, the stripping efficiency was as low as 17%.

Fabrication and testing of the tools for use in maintenance of the reactor system continued, with special emphasis on a freeze flange which had overhead interferences. Testing of an improved version of a general-purpose light for remote illumination was started.

Data from tests with the MSRE prototype pump showed that the diffusion of radioactive gas up the shaft annulus to the region of the shaft seal could be made acceptably low by flowing helium down the annulus and through the pump bowl at rates of 100 to 1000 liters/day, respectively. Flow rates of 3300 liters/day in the annulus and 4600 liters/day through the pump bowl are available in the MSRE.

The pump test was halted after 4700 hours of operation to modify the test facility. It was then resumed to observe the behavior of the flexible mount for supporting the fuel pump, the buoyancy liquid-level indicator, and the MSRE disconnect flange in the pump tank off-gas line, and to continue investigations with the device for measuring the concentration of undissolved gas in the flowing salt.

Endurance tests were continued with the PKP test pump. The test pump has one molten-salt-lubricated journal bearing and is used for the MSRE lubrication stand. The design of a fuel pump to accommodate a larger volume of thermally expanded fuel was initiated.

Six additional months of satisfactory operation were accumulated on a prototype model of a two-level single-point probe for indicating the liquid level in molten-salt systems. Performance is unchanged from that reported previously. The design of the MSRE probe assembly was modified to incorporate a secondary containment barrier.

A temperature scanner system being developed for use on the MSRE was demonstrated on the level test and on the ETL.

Eight MSRE prototype thermocouples continue to perform satisfactorily after 5000 hours of operation on the ETL. Ten similar thermocouples accumulated 5300 hours of satisfactory operation on the MSRE prototype pump test loop.

The analysis of MSRE Reactor is a crucial component in understanding its operational characteristics and safety parameters. By delving into the intricate details of its design and performance metrics, researchers can gain valuable insights into the reactor's behavior under various operational conditions. This analysis encompasses a wide range of factors, including thermal-hydraulics, neutronics, and materials science, all of which play a pivotal role in ensuring the efficient and safe operation of the MSRE Reactor. Through a comprehensive analysis approach, researchers can identify potential areas for optimization and enhancement, leading to advancements in reactor technology and nuclear safety standards.

Predicted control rod worth ranges from 5. 6 to 7. 6% dk/k, depending on the fuel composition. The rods are required to shim only about 1 to 3% dk/k, leaving ample shutdown margin. There is a large uncertainty in shim requirements due to lack of information on the properties determining the xenon removal from the core.

The tube-to-tubesheet joints for the MSRE heat exchanger were successfully brazed using a method previously developed for this purpose. Visual inspection, hydrostatic testing, and ultrasonic testing were performed on this heat exchanger with no evidence of leakage.

The thermal fatigue characteristics of INOR-8 were determined from the conventional Coffin-type test, and a low-cycle fatigue equation was found to describe the plastic strain-fatigue relation. Thermal fatigue data showed good agreement with those previously reported for isothermal.

MSRE moderator bars are being tested to establish the physical and mechanical properties of the material useful to the MSRE. The chemical composition and oxygen content of these bars met specification requirements. Test specimens from these bars were rapidly heated to 1800°F and cooled, with no deleterious effects on the graphite and no propagation of salt-filled cracks. An irradiation program for this material has been started. The use of molten salt to remove oxygen from graphite was demonstrated under conditions similar to those proposed for the MSRE.

Mixtures of Gd2O3 and Al2O3 were successfully cold-pressed and sintered into cylinders to 95% of calculated densities by working with pre-reacted powders. Distortion of the cylinder was minimized by the use of a holding fixture of the same composition.

Continued examinations of parts from earlier irradiations of MSRE fuel and graphite showed that xenon could be recovered from graphite cores even after several months of storage and that, although there was virtually no penetration of the graphite by fuel, uranium and lithium in small amounts were found in the graphite, probably as a result of oxidation-reduction processes associated with the release and recombination of Fp during shutdown.

Although the yield of CF from fissioning fuel containing submerged graphite was too small to be measured with certainty, a possible interpretation was that CF could be expected in the MSRE at 10% of the rate of production of long-lived xenon. Such a rate would be favorably low and would constitute no problem in MSRE operation.

The rate of recombination of Fg with fuel from which Fz had evolved as a result of radiation damage from decay energy was found to depend on the pressure of Fz but to be even more strongly dependent on both the condition of the fuel and the temperature. The behavior of fuel under gamma irradiation resembled that of in-pile capsules in response to decay energy, whereas electron irradiation gave somewhat lower yields of F2, and x-rays even lower. The x-ray experiments showed a noticeable difference in the response of individual components of the fuel.

The fuels for operation in the MSRE correspond closely in LiF and BeF2 proportions to compositions found along the 450°C isotherm that is associated with the LiF-rich region of the LiF-BeF2-ZrF ternary system. This provides the maximum LiF content consistent with a melting point below 450°C, thereby leading to the most favorable physical properties for a given content of quadrivalent fluorides.

Possible alterations in chemical oxidation-reduction potential of the fuel, normally buffered by the small fraction of UF3 formed as UF, come to virtual equilibrium with the containing metal. The UF content of the initial fuel has been set at ~1 mole % rather than the ~0. 15 mole % required for clean criticality. Since this is accomplished by decreased enrichment of UF3, there is a diminished heating effect in the unlikely event that uranium is deposited in the core.

A region of liquid-liquid immiscibility was found in the LiF-BeF2-ZrF system, in composition ranges that melt characteristically to glassy liquids containing BeF2. The miscibility gap includes ZrF concentrations from 25 to 70 mole % and LiF concentrations from 5 to 20 mole %. The exact boundaries, though far removed from regions of interest in reactors, are still under study in quenching experiments.

The structure of a recently discovered fluoride of xenon, XeF2-XeF, has been determined by X-ray diffraction. Conditions favorable for the existence of this addition compound may have occurred at some stage during the decay period following in-pile tests with sealed capsules that evolved xenon and subsequently F2.

Oxide equilibria in fluoride-salt-fuel-salt mixtures have provided additional evidence that there is no appreciable solid solution formation of UO₂ with ZrO₂ when excess oxide ions are scavenged from melts as ZrO₂. Indications in some ranges of a dependence on both concentration and temperature were found for the limiting 2UF₆/UFe₃ concentration ratio required for scavenging oxide as ZrO₂, but the better than 5:1 ratio design value previously specified for the MSRE contains an ample margin as far as operating fuel is concerned.

In connection with sulfur removal during fuel purification procedures, several bench-scale studies were carried out to compare the potential usefulness of alternate methods and to learn more of the detailed mechanisms of sulfur behavior with respect to both removal and corrosion. Relatively little change in current practice involving H2-HF mixtures was indicated, except that an associated use of elemental beryllium as a reducing agent, which should also be effective for other impurities as well, showed some promise of improved overall efficiency.

Among the factors that influence the interfacial behavior of MSRE fluoride melts with respect to graphite, trace amounts of H2O of 10 ppm or less in the atmosphere over sessile drops caused marked spreading or superficial wetting of graphite but no penetration. In comparison with H2O, O2 caused relatively little alteration of the normal non-wetting behavior; neither was saturation with dissolved oxides in the fluoride melt of any consequence in changing the non-wetting behavior.

Rates of removal of reducible impurities from MSRE melts were studied under various conditions. For treatments with H2, both higher flow rates (10 liters of H2 per minute) and higher temperatures had a significant effect in shortening the time required for purification.

Recent measurements on strongly reduced fuels gave unexpectedly low values for the solubility of UF3. The disagreement between these and previous measurements, and other puzzling data that were obtained, suggest that defined equilibrium conditions were not achieved.

A pyrolytic method was developed for determining the fluoride content of the fuel salts and was tested in the hot-cell mock-up. The salt is reacted with moist oxygen at 1000°C in the presence of U3O8 in nickel equipment, and the fluoride that is evolved is trapped in sodium hydroxide. A relative standard deviation of 14% was obtained when nonradioactive salts were analyzed by the use of remote techniques.

An amperometric method was developed for titrating Cr(VI) with ferrous sulfate to analyze for chromium in fuel salts. The precision of bench-type analysis is 1%. Testing of the method in the hot-cell mock-up has begun with nonradioactive samples.

A radio-frequency concentrator was incorporated in the ignition chamber of the modified Leco analyzer that is being used to study the determination of oxygen in fuel salts by inert-gas fusion procedures. Samples of uranium and zirconium oxides in graphite capsules were reduced to carbides within a 5-minute ignition period in the initial tests.

The statistical evaluation of the spectrophotometric method, which uses dimethylglyoxime and potassium persulfate oxidation for the determination of nickel, was completed in the hot-cell mock-up. The relative standard deviation of the method was 2. 84%.

Design of the mechanical systems for the reactor consisted mainly in modifying existing drawings to incorporate recent results of development work and to ease fabrication and construction problems. New design work was started on an overflow tank for the fuel pump, a new fuel pump with a larger bowl, and a strainer for the reactor vessel.

The present design of the fuel pump was based on experience with components that existed early in the 1960s and included enough margin of safety to ensure that a reliable pump could be developed in a short time. As a result, the diameter and overhang of the shaft and the diameter of the bowl were limited to values which, in turn, restricted the free volume in the pump bowl to less than 2 ft. The pump bowl is also a surge tank for the fuel system, and this small volume, although adequate for normal operation, provided very little margin for accommodating abnormal conditions. Initially, an overflow line was included in the design to return excess liquid from the pump bowl to the drain tank. However, the design of the overflow line was considerably more difficult than had been expected, and since its operation presented several uncertainties, an overflow tank was substituted for the line.

The arrangement of the fuel pump and the overflow tank is shown located near the suction line directly below the pump bowl in the pump furnace and is coupled to the pump by a short overflow line. The tank is equipped with bubblers to indicate the liquid level. Liquid can be returned to the fuel system by pressurizing the tank with helium through the bubbler lines or the vent line.

A replacement for the fuel pump is being designed. The design will include a larger pump bowl to eliminate the overflow tank and a float-type liquid-level indicator to substitute for one of the bubbler-type indicators. Experience with the prototype pump indicates that the shaft overhang can be increased sufficiently to provide a fuel expansion volume of about 6 ft without changing the shaft diameter, the seals, the bearings, or the bowl diameter, and without significantly reducing the reliability. The float-type level indicator was developed too late to be included in.

The Molten Salt Reactor Experiment (MSRE) was designed under the assumption that there would be no attrition of graphite in the core, ensuring that no chips of graphite would circulate with the fuel. Upon inspecting the graphite used in the reactor, it was found that some spalling could occur. Therefore, a screen (strainer) was specifically designed to be installed in the reactor vessel to filter out pieces larger than 1/8 inch in diameter from the circulating fuel. The installation process is depicted in Fig. 2. A portion of the screen is welded to the head of the reactor vessel, while the majority of it is integrated into an extension of the plug and control rod thimble assembly that penetrates through the nozzle on the top of the vessel head. This assembly is replaceable, albeit with some level of difficulty, once the reactor has been operated at power.

The system layout. Except for minor revisions, the layout of the instrumentation and controls remains the same, as described in previous reports. One process instrument panel was added in the auxiliary control room. Multipoint temperature recorders with alarm switches, which will monitor the reactor drain-line temperatures, are located in this panel. Two auxiliary control panels serving the lube-oil packages were relocated in the service room to provide more space for other purposes. The two control panels for the helium cover-gas purification system were moved to the west end of the diesel house near the helium supply station. Locations of additional conduits between field-mounted equipment and the nearest wireways were determined. Locations of thermocouple and instrument disconnects within the reactor and drain tank cells remained firm, but the assignment of individual thermocouples to disconnects was considerably revised. These revisions are the result of a continuing review of remote maintenance requirements and the addition of an overflow tank for the fuel pump bowl.

Flow Diagrams: All instrument application diagrams, instrument tabulations, and design drawings were revised in accordance with recent design changes. The diagram of the chemical processing system is not yet approved for construction. Recent changes to the design of the fuel pump bowl cover gas system, the addition of a pump bowl overflow tank, and additional instrumentation dictated by control circuit design will require further revisions to these diagrams.

Simulation of Reactor Fill and Drain Transients. Further studies were made of an analog computer model of the fill and drain system. The fill-system control was designed to fill the reactor in a reasonable time and yet ensure a salt flow rate of no more than 0. 5 cfm when the core is half full, according to the requirements of the postulated fill accident. A capillary restrictor was designed and calibrated for insertion in the helium fill line to so limit the flow under worst-case conditions. A simulation incorporating the characteristics of this capillary indicated that the time required for a normal fill would be approximately 3-1/2 hr.

Recent studies of various means of preventing pressure surges in the pump bowl resulted in the incorporation of a single capillary restrictor in the common bypass line between the pump bowl and the drain tanks. Further investigation of the undesirable results of pressure surges (possible damage to pump-bowl oil seal, reversal of purge-gas flow, and erroneous level instrument indication) led to a compromise between these effects and the retarding of a dump and to a relaxing of the requirements for limiting the surges. It was decided to design the restrictor such that the surge would not affect the pump-bowl level indication so long as the valve in the line to the spare drain tank was open. Table 1. 1 summarizes the drain times for various conditions, where in each case the initial bowl pressure was 5 psig, the initial drain tank (No. 1) pressure was 27 psig, and the bowl purge flow rate was 0. 15 scfm. The freeze valve was assumed to open 5 min after the start of the run, and the drain times shown started when the freeze valve opened.

Control Circuitry Design. The control and safety circuit requirements were studied in great detail. Firm criteria for their design were established, and the preliminary block diagrams were extensively revised. Design of the circuits proceeded in those areas where criteria were available. Schematic drawings of the 12 freeze valve circuits were completed and approved. Block diagrams showing control logic for process fill and drain, coolant salt, containment, freeze valve safety, and auxiliary process control systems have now been approved. Together, these diagrams describe the criteria for control and protection.

Maximum rate time to time for draining Tank 2, draining Tank 1 of pressure drain, 25% complete bypass, bypass vent rise in pump of core drain: open closed open none 15. 2 59. 4, closed open open 15 13. 8 41. 3, closed open closed 15 16. 3 43, closed closed open none 19.

The design of three thermocouple alarm panels, two thermocouple scanner panels, and one main board panel was completed and approved. Minor revisions to two main board panels were also completed. Work on two process radiation monitor panels is nearing completion, and the control-circuit relay cabinet design is underway. The fuel pump level transmitter panel is being redesigned to accommodate the new equipment required by the addition of the pump bowl overflow tank.

Field Installation Design: Drawings of the routing of interconnecting wiring and cables for the annunciator system and for the Foxboro Electronic Control Instrumentation system were completed and approved for construction.

The design of the thermocouple interconnections, including wiring diagrams for the large junction boxes just outside the cells, was extensively revised to incorporate changes resulting from reassignment of thermocouples to disconnects within the reactor and drain cells and addition of in-cell thermocouples.

Design of the thermocouple installation has proved to be more difficult than originally expected. Owing to the requirements of remote maintenance and the compactness of the in-cell reactor system, the location of disconnects and the routing of leads, as well as the disconnect assignment and the point of attachment of each in-cell thermocouple, have had to be carefully selected. Numerous changes in thermocouple location and other drawings were required before the many conflicting requirements were satisfied. The design of this system is now considered to be reasonably firm.

Thermocouple locations in the chemical processing system and the fuel loading and transfer system were determined. The thermocouple tabulation was revised and approved for construction. A proposed design for the two thermocouple wells, one each to be installed immediately upstream and downstream from the coolant salt radiator, was submitted for comment. Calculations indicate that the proposed well is strong enough to withstand the conditions of temperature, pressure, velocity, and vibration existing in the system. The design of the thermocouple scanner system is complete except for the addition of a signal-identification device.

Process and Personnel Radiation Monitors. The number and type of process monitors remain as previously reported. The chemical plant monitors have not been specified. Panel, shield, and detector installation drawings were completed, and all equipment was ordered.

Personnel monitoring instruments remain as previously reported. A drawing showing individual instrument locations was issued. The instruments were ordered, and most have been delivered. The criteria for incorporating the personnel monitors into the building evacuation system are being developed.

The reactor vessel is about 90% complete; final assembly will be done when the graphite core blocks are received in October. After some temporary suspension of work on the control rod thimbles pending the results of development work, drawings are being revised, and fabrication work is being restarted.

Fabrication of the coolant pump bowl was completed, and final machining of the fuel pump bowl is in progress. Work is continuing on the fuel pump cooling shroud. Fabrication of the overflow tank is in progress, and a float-type level indicator unit is being made for it.

The finish machining of the bearing housings for both pumps was completed, and the pump lubricating oil stands are complete except for the installation of the instrumentation. Vessels for three more motors are in various stages of weld repair of laminar defects.

The coolant-salt storage tank furnace, fuel pump furnace, and four salt storage tank furnaces (excluding removable electric heaters) were completed. Fabrication of 12 heater control panels, reactor heaters, and drain tank removable heaters is ongoing.

Procurement was completed for numerous electrical items, including heaters, cable, transformers, thermal insulation, wire, seals, terminal blocks, and other materials. Procurement is approximately 90% complete for all electrical items, except the special pipe heaters.

Procurement is complete for special optical tooling equipment. Vendor fabrication of the large, portable, sliding shield for the maintenance facility is nearing completion. Fabrication was started on the graphite sampler equipment.

Young Radiator Company completed the three space coolers for removing heat from the reactor and drain tank. The two helium preheaters and a leak detector valve cabinet were finished. One stainless steel expansion tank, one stainless steel condensate tank, and other miscellaneous equipment were obtained from vendors. Fabrication of a treated helium surge tank.

Four stainless venturi flow elements for measuring flow in the lubricating oil packages for the salt pumps were delivered. The neutron instrument tube extension for the reactor is complete. The neutron tube harp assembly and six process line detector lead shields are being fabricated.

The fuel transfer tube and positioning jig assembly were completed. The special motorized valves were received from the vendor. Fabrication of the main unit of the sampler-enricher awaits completion of a redesign of some pieces on the basis of results of development tests.

The dismantling and removal of switchgear panels, circuit breakers, etc. in the diesel building west of Building 7503 has begun. Existing wiring and electrical gear to be used in the MSRE are being checked out; this work is approximately 10% complete.

With the exception of some additional instrumentation required by recent revisions and instrumentation for the chemical processing system, preparation of specifications and initiation of procurement of process instrument components were completed. Most of these components are now on hand, and delivery of the others is expected within the next three.

Several orders for components that required special development or procurement effort were completed. The special components include the weld-sealed transmitters and valves for radioactive helium gas service. Freeze-flange and freeze-valve temperature alarm switches were received from the Electro Systems Corporation, and acceptance tests were completed. Vendors' quotations for weld-sealed solenoid valves are being evaluated. Purchase orders have been placed for all components of the thermocouple.

The installation of 149 thermocouples in the radiator assembly was completed. Thermocouple disconnects and multiconductor extension cables in the reactor cell are being installed. Installation of control valves and signal transmitters in the coolant drain cell is also underway.

The drain-tank cooler test was terminated after 2600 cycles between 1300 and 212°F owing to a leak in the steam system. This test is believed to be equivalent to several years of service in the MSRE. Figure 2. 1 shows one of the three Inconel cooling tube assemblies after it was, which were in contact with the carbonate salt on the outside and air on the inside, were in good condition. Two of the three 1-inch-diameter sched-40 pipe cooling tubes that were inserted in the thimbles were cracked, as well as additional severe cracking on this tube at the same elevation but on the opposite side.

1 indicating the severity of the cracking. This cracking was at the same elevation as that shown in Fig. 2, and the resulting jet of water possibly contributed to the damage of the cooling tube. Figure shows how the 1/16-inch spacer bars that centered the cooling tube inside the thimble had cracked. It also shows another crack at a weld point. The thermocouple shown had failed previously, as indicated in the thermocouple test described later in this chapter.

The reflectively insulated heater boxes for the 5-inch pipe were operated as a life test. Data from the beginning and the end of six months of continuous operation at 1400°F are compared in. 7. The increased heat loss is due to a change in the emissivity of the laminations and damage to the silver plating of one of the units, as previously reported. Silver plating of the undamaged heater is in excellent condition. Both units under test appear to be in good condition, with little warping. A contract has been let to the Mirror Insulation Company of Lambertville, New Jersey, for the detailed design and fabrication of similar heaters for the reactor.

The variation in length of the flexible control rod after a scram operation continues to be a problem. The accuracy of the rod position measurement needed for use in the analysis of reactivity data was established as 40.2 inches.

A positive position indicator is being tested, which will detect the passage of the lower end of the rod past a known point. It is a simple air gauge that makes use of the cooling air, which normally flows down the hollow control rod. An air-exhaust nozzle with radial ports is attached to the bottom end of the rod, and a throat (or restrictor) is welded into the guide bar cage at a known point in the thimble. When the nozzle passes through the throat, a clear signal is indicated on the recording of the pressure drop across the rod. By calibrating the synchro indicators of rod position with the pressure signals when a rod is installed, any change in the rod length during operation is indicated as a change in the calibration. Preliminary results show that the error in the indication of the single position is less than 0.1 in.

The prototype rod drive mechanism was received from the Vard Corporation of Pasadena, California, in mid-July. Figure 2.8 shows the complete drive unit together with its housing, and Figure 2. 9 shows the power- and the position-indicator package. One of the position-indicator synchros was found to be electrically grounded internally and was returned to the contractor for replacement.

Construction of the test loop for the helium purification system was completed, and proof testing of the dryer and oxygen-removal unit was started. The loop consists of a molecular sieve dryer for water removal and a high-temperature titanium sponge bed for oxygen removal, plus associated flow, pressure, and temperature controls, and analytical equipment for determining the moisture and oxygen content of the gas stream. The efficiency of the system is checked by introducing helium at known impurity levels and monitoring the effluent gas.

Complete removal (<0. 1 ppm) was obtained with inlet concentrations up to 225 ppm, but after the titanium bed reached 15% of saturation, breakthrough occurred at an inlet concentration of 100 ppm, indicating that a higher operating temperature will be required.

The unit was shut down to repair a leak in the lower flange of the oxygen-removal unit. Examination of the oxygen removal unit, which had been at a temperature for 1500 hr during the test period, showed the condition of the internal parts to be satisfactory.

The oxygen concentrations were measured during the above tests with a Lockwood and McLorie electrolytic oxygen analyzer, model E. Agreement to within 10% has been found with mass spectrometry analysis of samples of helium that contained more than 20 ppm oxygen, and the accuracy at 1 ppm oxygen is expected to be about the same.

Fabrication of the sampler-enricher system mockup and its installation into the Engineering Test Loop (ETL) was completed, and testing was started.

After components were checked out and tested individually, the entire system was used to isolate a sample of the uranium-bearing salt. After a few changes were made, mostly in the control systems, the sampling time should be reduced to about 2 hours.

The cable drive mechanism, as shown in Fig. 11, operated satisfactorily during the test. In one test, the drive mechanism was overloaded to the stalled condition without apparent damage to the motor. Readings on the capsule position indicator were reproducible to less than 1/4 inch. In the fully withdrawn position, the capsule latch properly positioned itself such that it could be operated with the manipulator, except in a few cases in which the latch had been rotated 180° about the cable by hand. In these cases, the latch hung in the rotated position, and the manipulator was needed to pivot it into proper alignment. Minor design modifications will improve this self-aligning mechanism. The latch and attached capsule were inserted and withdrawn into the pump bowl through the transfer tube without difficulty.

The sample capsule was attached to and released from the latch easily with the manipulator and required about 1 minute. The manipulator was also used to guide the sample transport container into place on the jig. Except for leakage at the end seals of the two-ply boots used to exclude oxygen from the manipulator work area, the manipulator was satisfactory. Additional work will be done on the boot seals to eliminate molding flaws.

Capillary flow restrictors are used to control helium flow rates to various parts of the system and to measure helium leak rates through the numerous double-sealing, buffered valves, and closures. By maintaining a constant helium supply pressure to the flow restrictors, the downstream pressure is proportioned to the gas flow through the restrictor. The leak-detector lines are supplied from a common restrictor with a pressure gauge and an alarm to indicate an excessive flow. The sample-removal valve, the operational valve, and the access port have individual flow restrictors and pressure recorders which are used in the control circuit to indicate proper closure. The accuracy of indication obtained with these devices was equivalent to a flow rate of approximately 1 cm of helium (STP) per minute.

Two sets of ring-joint flanges with integral rings were fabricated as parts of the sample transfer tube for the reactor. The assembled sets are shown in Fig. 12. One set was fabricated from forging blanks of 3014 stainless steel, and the other from INOR-8. Helium leak rates of <5 X 10^(-7) cm (STP)/sec were obtained on both sets on the initial assembly. A torque of 40 lb-ft was required to bring the spring clamps into place. The disconnects will be retested after they are welded into place.

Three 1-1/2-in. IPS valves with motor operators, manufactured by the William Powell Company of Cincinnati, Ohio, were received for use as the operational and maintenance valves of the reactor sampler. Acceptance tests performed at the factory gave a total helium leak rate across both gate seals of < 0. 2 cm (STP)/min, with a 40-psi pressure differential supplied through the leak-detector opening. Since the motor operator is larger than the one used in the initial layout, minor redesign of the valve containment box was necessary.

The sampler-enricher is being redesigned for use in the MSRE. Most of the changes involve only a repackaging of various components to reduce the size of the containment access openings and to locate all gas and electrical disconnects outside the containment boxes. The cost of redesign will be partially offset by a reduction in fabrication and maintenance costs.

Following the treatments of the flush salt with HF and H₂ to remove oxide that was introduced by the graphite, two additional treatments were performed to evaluate the oxide-removal and cold trap collection efficiency. Beryllium oxide was added in an amount equal to ~100 ppm oxygen in the salt. The HF treatment began ten days later (the fifth treatment in this tank), and 72% of the added oxygen was collected as water in the cold traps in the off-gas line.

Oxygen was removed from the 162 kg of salt during 168 hours of treatment with a mixture of H₂ and HF. The large total amount of oxide that was removed and the low solubility of oxide in this salt indicate that a large portion was a precipitate.

Figure 2. 13 shows the water collection rates observed during the HF treatment of the fuel salt. Each of two periods of HF treatment was followed by a period of stripping with H2 and He. The kinetics of water stripping is characteristic of a process where the metal oxide (ZrO2) is present as two phases in the salt mix. The active phase is undoubtedly dissolved in the molten salt and reacts rapidly with HF. The inactive phase is probably a solid oxide which dissolves slowly as the salt becomes unsaturated.

Analysis of the data indicates that around 68% of the total oxide was originally in the inactive phase. After the treatment, the salt mixture was stripped by sparging with H2 for 38 hours and with He for 60 hours before it was loaded into the loop.

After the graphite was sampled through the dry box, the graphite access joint was opened to the atmosphere so that the deposit, which remained from the flush-salt operation, could be removed. This was done to provide a clean surface for any subsequent deposition during fuel-salt operation. After the loop was reassembled, it was evacuated at 200°F and then cleaned with flush salt. To prevent contact with the cleaned access joint surface, the flush salt was kept out of the annulus by a continuous bleed of helium into the joint.

The access joint was again operated without a frozen salt seal so that samples might be obtained if any deposit collected due to cold trapping. After the loop was filled with salt, the liquid level in the joint was adjusted to the position and temperature of the previous operation with flush salt, but without the stabilizing benefit of the frozen salt cake at the top of the joint.

For the first 500 to 600 hours of operation, the salt level in the joint rose slowly upward, necessitating periodic additions of gas to maintain the desired level detected by thermocouples. Tests with a helium leak detector showed that this effect was not caused by a loss of the trapped gas due to leakage. The possibility that the loss of gas was due to transport from the joint to the lower pressure of the pump bowl as dissolved gas in the molten salt was tested by introducing argon into the joint annulus. The much lower solubility of argon in molten salt caused the loss of gas to be reduced to an insignificant amount, and the liquid level remained reasonably stable (41/8 in). By cooling the upper portion of the joint with air, the container wall at the liquid-gas interface was maintained at ~1000°F, 200° below the bulk salt temperature.

The loop was drained with cooling air on the upper joint and without additional heat. The joint was examined via the removable dry box facility, and samples of the deposit were removed for analysis. Unlike the previous joint that was exposed to flush salt, the removable plug was completely clear of any deposit or discoloration below the liquid level. At the liquid level, there was a deposit on a portion of the circumference of the plug, with only a discoloration on the remainder. The deposit occurred on the side corresponding to the salt outlet of the graphite container, indicating it to be flow-oriented, as was noted during previous operation. The deposit appeared in definite layers, beginning next to the metal wall with a dark, metallic layer that was covered.

With salt crystal bands of green, clear (white), and orange, the predominant layer contained the white crystals and occurred at the liquid level. This crust formed evidently, to the exclusion of uranium-bearing phases, by selective freezing of the lithium, beryllium, and zirconium phases identified in Table 2. 1. The presence of the 2Li-BeFs, which melts at 850°F, would indicate the temperature to be this low at this location of the joint. This is possible even though the outside wall temperature was recorded at approximately 1000°F because the temperature gradient at this point is very steep. Zirconium oxide was identified petrographically, but no uranium oxide was detected.

Since corrosive attack by trace impurities is directed toward chromium in the container walls, most of the salt samples removed from the loop during operation are routinely analyzed for chromium and iron. Analysis for nickel usually shows less than the limit of quantification (LOQ) parts per million (ppm).

During the fuel-salt operation rather than during the flush-salt operation, if it is assumed that chromium is removed to a uniform depth from both Inconel and INOR-8 surfaces, the increase of 500 ppm during fuel-salt operation shown in Figure 2. 14 represents the removal of chromium to a depth of 0. 7 mil during 2000 hr of operation.

Preliminary studies have shown that the xenon distribution throughout the MSRE system (and the Xe+3° poison level) is strongly dependent on the removal efficiency in the pump bowl (0. 15). Experiments have been planned and are being conducted to determine this removal efficiency.

The initial experiments for measuring removal efficiency were attempted in the MSRE prototype pump testing facility. Since there was no effective means for measuring the concentration of dissolved tracer gas in molten salt, it was necessary to monitor the tracer activity in the pump bowl gas space. The experiments consisted of saturating the system with a tracer gas (Kr5), purging the pump bowl with helium, and monitoring the decay of the tracer concentration in the pump bowl. The insolubility of Kr5 in molten salt prevented determination of the removal efficiency. These results are shown in Fig. 16.

The problems of low solubility of tracer and sensitivity of analysis are reduced by using carbon dioxide in solution in water for the test. The information from the CO2-water experiments will be applied toward the determination of the efficiency of stripping xenon from molten salt. This experimental facility is similar to the prototype pump testing facility in all necessary requirements for conducting a stripping experiment, namely, size and configuration of pump bowl and stripping device. Carbon dioxide is dissolved in the water and is removed by an air purge through the pump.

The main difficulty has been caused by the production of bubbles of air, water vapor, and carbon dioxide in localized low-pressure zones. The presence of bubbles complicates the analysis of the experimental data. However, a low-pressure zone caused by a valve, orifice, or pipe bend is an excellent stripping device and may provide an effective means of xenon control. System modifications and operation with low flow rates were necessary measures taken toward the elimination of bubbles. The first bubble-free results, taken with a flow rate of 850 gpm and a 2.

After a successful demonstration of the freeze flange maintenance procedure, the design of the tools was completed, incorporating the improvements indicated by the demonstration. Special consideration was given to the flange in line 100, which connects the reactor and the fuel pump. Overhead interferences with another salt line on one side of the work area and a pump support beam on the other side require a more complex flange-clamp operator tool.

This tool differs from the others tested in that the applied load is offset from the centerline of the hydraulic cylinder, thus putting a moment on the ram. This effect was reduced by using the outside wall of the cylinder as a bearing surface; no difficulty was encountered after repeated tests. Additional alterations were made to the support mast extension to reduce the problem of engaging the tool onto the clamp. A device was fabricated to permit tilting such masts to a more convenient angle for working under interferences. The pipe alignment tool was also modified to permit working with these overhead interferences.

Test of an improved version of the HRT rod light for remote illumination was started. With this design (shown in Fig. 17), the electrical hookup is entirely mechanical, so there will be no solder to melt off as the lamp heats up. The bulb guard is stronger and provides more mechanical protection. The added expense of fabricating these lights will be offset by the savings in maintenance time.

A tool to handle the thermocouple disconnect was designed with alignment guides to protect the pins of the disconnect during assembly. A prototype heater, including the power lead-in and disconnects, was assembled, and tests indicate that it is a satisfactory arrangement.

High-Temperature Circulation of Molten Salt. The prototype pump was temporarily halted after 4700 hours to modify the test facility. During the run, tests were made to determine the back-diffusion rate of radioactive gas up the shaft annulus against the helium purge, and a program was started to measure the concentration of undissolved gas in the circulating salt.

Diffusion of Radioactive Gas Up the Pump Shaft Annulus. One of the functions of the helium purge down the pump shaft in the MSRE fuel pump is to prevent or minimize the diffusion of radioactive gas from the pump tank into the region of the lower seal and catch basin, where it could cause the oil that leaks past the shaft lower seal to polymerize. The damage to this oil is not important, per se, but gradual blockage of the drain could result in forcing the leakage into the pump shaft annulus and could eventually cause seizure of the shaft.

The radiation tolerance of the oil used with the MSRE pumps is 107 rads/g. With this amount of irradiation, the oil will flow and drain from the catch basin. The permissible source in the catch basin of the MSRE fuel pump for a dose of 107 rads/g of oil with 1-MeV beta radiation is 0. 13 curie. This is based on the conservative assumption that the leakage through the catch basin is 1 g/day and that all the energy of the betas is absorbed by the oil. 1 x 10^74.

Tests were performed on the prototype pump to investigate diffusion of radioactive gas up the pump shaft annulus, which is identical to the annulus in the MSRE fuel pump. The path for the flow of gas through the annulus and the catch basin is shown in Fig. 18.

The results of the diffusion tests on the prototype pump are shown in Table 2. 3. There was no detectable diffusion of Kr5 up the shaft annulus with purge rates as low as 100 liters/day when the concentration catch basin. Thus, the maximum permissible concentration of 3. 1 x 10^7 curie/cm should not be exceeded in the catch basin if the concentration in the pump tank is maintained at less than 11 curies/cm. The concentration of radioactivity in the pump tank is related to the purge flow, as shown in. 19. A purge flow of 3300 liters/day down the shaft annulus and 4600 liters/day total through the pump bowl are available in the MSRE.

Continued High-Temperature Operation. The three modifications made to the test facility at the conclusion of the 4700-hr run included installation of the MSRE fuel pump support (. 20), a buoyancy-type continuous liquid-level indicator in the pump tank, and an MSRE disconnect flange in the pump tank off-gas line. During the modification, fresh salt was added to the system.

The pump support provides for limited movement of the pump along each of three mutually perpendicular axes and was designed to impose relatively small forces and moments on pump suction and discharge nozzles. The pump tank was mounted on the support, and the loop was anchored at one point and supported at two other points with spring hangers. The anchor point was chosen so that the displacements of the pump along one horizontal axis and the vertical axis would be similar to, but smaller than, those which the reactor fuel pump will experience.

Vertical displacement of the pump: The loop pipe anchor was removed, and the pump was lifted with an overhead crane: (1) with the counterbalance springs, which provide for the vertical displacement set at zero force, and (2) with these same springs set to provide for 8600 lb of upward force. The difference in the total forces required to lift the pump in these two tests and the signs of rubbing noted on lifting-link components indicated the existence of unwanted rubbing forces in the components. The support was removed for further inspection and testing and for alterations to remove the cause of sluggish operation in the vertical direction. It was replaced with the rigid supports used previously.

Pump Inspection and Assembly Prior to Current Operation. The pump rotary element was closely inspected following the 1700 hr of operation. There was evidence of oil leakage past the copper ring gasket at the joint between the shield plug and the bearing housing. This leakage had drained down the outside surface of the shield plug and formed a black carbon deposit over the lower two-thirds of the shield plug.

Droplets of fuel were found on the lower end of the shield plug. A small deposit of fuel was found in the lower reaches of the annulus between the shaft and the shield plug. This deposit was probably formed during periods when the purge rates in the shaft annulus were low. The ring-joint gasket groove in the pump tank was discolored along approximately 1 inch of the periphery, possibly indicating a leak. Otherwise, the pump rotary element was found to be in good condition.

The pump was assembled with new preloaded bearings, and the shaft seals were replaced. Shaft deflection and natural frequency measurements were made, indicating that the preloaded bearings increased the shaft stiffness by approximately 15%. The new shaft seals contain bellows assemblies with the Graphitar nose pieces attached by a clear baking varnish.

Cold shakedown of the shaft seals was performed for 100 hours before the installation of the rotary element in the prototype pump loop. There was no measurable leakage from the lower seal; the upper seal leaked at a rate of 4 cm3/day. The pump rotary element, prior to installation in the loop, is shown in Figure 21.

Insulation on the stator and rotor windings was found to be burned and was replaced. The pump rotary element was disassembled, inspected, and reassembled for further endurance tests. The shaft lower seal was replaced with one having the Graphitar nose piece attached to the bellows assembly with clear baking varnish. Cold shakedown will be performed on the rotary element before it is installed in the hot-test facility.

This pump was placed in operation at 1200 rpm, circulating the salt down after 58 hours of operation when high current to the drive motor interrupted the electric power. Disassembly of the pump revealed that the impeller and shaft, respectively, had jammed against the volute and molten salt bearing. It is believed that the incident was caused by the loss of two of the four fulcrum pins, which provide for the angular displacement in the gimbals mount that supports the bearing.

The lubrication pump was shut down after operating 7344 hours at 3550 rpm while circulating turbine-type oil at 160°F and 70 gallons per minute. A short had developed in the insulation in the stator windings of the motor. The motor was rewound twice (it shorted after approximately 1 minute of operation after the first rewind), and the pump was placed back in operation and has operated 250 hours at the above conditions.

Design of a new fuel pump for the MSRE was initiated. It differs from the present design in that the pump-tank volume available for thermal. The hydraulic design of the impeller and volute will not be changed, but its height will be extended to provide the increased expansion volume.

Design drawings for the probes to be installed in the MSRE were completed and approved; however, the design is being revised to incorporate secondary containment of the electrical leads. This secondary barrier is being obtained by the use of ceramic-to-metal hermetic seals on individual leads that penetrate the mounting head.

The probability that the probe would be damaged or ruptured if the salt in the drain tanks were allowed to freeze and were subsequently melted was studied. Results of this study indicate that damage is not likely if the normal precautions necessary to prevent damage to other parts of the system are taken.

Testing of two float-type level indicators, started in February 1962, is continuing. During the 18 months since the start of testing, one differential transformer has been at 1250°F, except for short periods when the temperature was raised to 1300°F or dropped to 1000°F. The other (mounted outside the furnace, but insulated) has operated continuously, with one end at 1000°F and the other at 300°F. Both indicators continue to operate satisfactorily.

A third indicator of similar design, except that a hollow INOR-8 float is used instead of a solid graphite float, was constructed and installed on the MSRE prototype pump test. Testing of this device began on July 26, 1963, and initial performance was satisfactory.

Contingent on satisfactory performance of the pump test loop installation, the ball-float level transmitter has been accepted for use in the MSRE system, and all necessary design drawings have been completed for its installation on the MSRE coolant pump bowl. Since extensive piping revisions would be required, this type of transmitter will not be installed on the MSRE fuel pump bowl unless serious difficulties are experienced with the bubbler level system during pre-critical operation or unless the new pump, which is presently being designed to provide greater expansion volume in the pump bowl, is installed. Studies are being made to determine the feasibility of adapting the present level indicator design to the new pump. The major problem to be resolved is that of increasing the range from 5 to 16 in. The feasibility of installing the float directly in the pump bowl instead of in an outboard chamber is also being investigated.

After the test was discontinued, a report was issued by the loop operator. The report stated that the scanner was a valuable tool for use in operating the loop. It was recommended that some recorders be used in conjunction with the scanner and that a signal marking device be provided to positively identify each thermocouple displayed on the oscilloscope. A signal marking system is being developed. At present, it appears feasible to assemble a satisfactory, low-cost marker system from commercially available modules.

The temperature scanning system has now been accepted for use on the MSRE. The MSRE system will have five 100-point scanner channels and will be flexible enough to permit blocking and transferring of thermocouples to other scanning channels, either individually or in groups of 25. All major components will have plug-in connectors. This feature will greatly reduce downtime in the event of component failure. The design of this system has been completed.

Bayonet Thermocouples. The testing of thermocouples in the drain-tank test facility for endurance under thermal shock in the temperature range 1350 to 200°F was completed. The failure of two more thermocouples at 2630 cycles, plus previously reported failures, left only three of ten thermocouples still functioning. The bayonet tubes to which the thermocouples were attached were removed from the rig and submitted to Metallurgy for examination. It is believed that some of this damage was inflicted during the removal operation.

Thermocouple End Seals. The testing of materials and techniques for use in sealing the ends of mineral-insulated thermocouples and copper-tube-sheathed thermocouple extension cables was continued. Several satisfactory seals were made with this material under laboratory conditions.

The feasibility of using closed-circuit television viewing during remote maintenance operations at the MSRE is being investigated. Methods being considered include single- and two-channel stereo (three-dimensional) viewing and multichannel (one-dimensional) viewing, using two or more cameras located to view the subject from different angles.

Both types of stereo systems were installed and compared in a remote maintenance test facility. Operation of a multichannel one-dimensional system was observed at the Atomics International Santa Susana Site; results to date are inconclusive. Each type of system has certain inherent advantages and disadvantages. The single-channel system, which is manufactured by the Stereotronic Company, has the inherent disadvantage that the horizontal field of view is restricted, and a high lighting level is required to obtain a satisfactory picture. The two-channel stereo system requires more equipment and is therefore more subject to failure. At present, it appears that the two-channel system is more difficult to adjust and may produce more operator fatigue than the Stereotronic system. Evaluations of all three types of systems are continuing.

During this report period, the problem has been the design of the high-temperature INOR-8 diaphragm seal heads to satisfy ORNL requirements for weld quality and minimum material thickness without sacrificing performance characteristics. Major difficulties have been resolved, and design drawings are being prepared for ORNL approval.

As previously reported, one of the two bubblers undergoing developmental testing on the MSRE prototype pump test facility became plugged with salt due to leakage in an improperly installed fitting. Previous efforts to remove this plug had been unsuccessful.

During a recent shutdown of the MSRE prototype pump test loop, the plugged bubbler line was explored with a flexible rod. It was found that the line was open down to the semicircular pipe in the pump bowl and as far along this line as the rod could reach. Since there was no gas flow through this bubbler when pressure was applied, it must be assumed that the dip leg is still plugged. There are two types of dip legs being tested in this pump bowl. One is an open pipe with a V-notch cut in the side of the open end. The other has a closed end with a 1/8-in. -diameter hole in the side of the pipe just above the end. The latter is the one that is plugged. Since the dip leg involved is inaccessible, the cause of plugging cannot be determined until the leg can be inspected when the pump is.

Design of the bubblers for the MSRE fuel pump installation has been revised to use the V-notch construction instead of the 1/8-inch hole. The design of the MSRE coolant pump bubbler could not be changed since fabrication of this pump has been completed.

The nuclear characteristics of the reactor were calculated for a two-region breeder. Salt C contains sufficient U-235 to increase the uranium concentration in the fuel to 0.8 mole%. At this concentration, there should be little concern about the chemical stability of the fuel. Salt C will be used in the first operation of the MSRE.

In the calculation of critical uranium concentrations and flux distributions, the reactor was represented by a multiregion, cylindrical model, similar to one described previously. Critical concentrations were computed with MODRIC, a one-dimensional, multigroup code. Resonance cross sections for the MODRIC calculations were generated for each core composition with the GAM-1 code.

For each region of the reactor model, the two-group constants were employed in calculations with Equipoise-3, a two-dimensional, two-group code, which gave various coefficients of reactivity, reactivity importance functions, neutron lifetime, and absolute neutron fluxes.

The Equipoise-3 program was utilized in the control rod calculations. The cross-section of the core, including the control rods, was represented in x-y geometry as shown in Fig. 1. Dimensions were selected to provide the same transverse geometric buckling in the square core model as in the transparency to neutrons of higher energy. Transmission through the thimbles and across the air gap was computed using a P-1 approximation.

The total worth of the three control rods inserted all the way through the core was calculated for the clean, critical core at 1200°F with fuels A, B, and C. The worth is different for each fuel because of differences in the neutron diffusion properties of the core. The worths of various combinations of fully inserted or fully withdrawn rods were calculated as a function of the distance inserted and reported earlier.

The control rods are required to make the reactor subcritical at times and to compensate for the changes in reactivity that occur during a cycle of startup, power operation, and shutdown.

A loss of delayed neutrons occurs when the fuel circulating pump is started. At the same time, gas is entrained in the circulating fuel by the action of the stripper in the pump bowl. The gas effects in Table 3. 4 assume 2 vol% gas at the pump suction or 1. 2 vol% in the core.

The xenon poisoning depends on the flux, the stripper efficiency, the xenon diffusivity in the graphite, and the fuel-graphite xenon transfer. 5 x 10^7 ft^2/hr, and a mass transfer coefficient of 0. 08 ft/hr. Considering the uncertainties in these values, the xenon effect is expected to be between one-third and twice the values tabulated.

The reactivity effect of Sm-149 and similar high cross-section, long-lived fission products levels off at about 1. 1% Δk/k at high power. If the flux is reduced to zero after high-power operation, the poisoning effect increases because of short-lived precursor decay by 0. 1% Δk/k. The poisoning decreases by the same amount when the power is again raised.

Any of the control rods can be used as a servo-driven regulating rod, while the other two are controlled manually. All three rods are used for shimming, and all can be used for shutdown. In order to provide the maximum shutdown margin, the uranium concentration of the fuel is limited to barely that required for full-power full-poison operation with all rods at the upper limits of their operating ranges. At the upper limits, which are set to avoid the low sensitivities at extreme withdrawal, the rod poison amounts to about 0. 5% 5k/k.

A typical program of rod positions during an operating cycle is shown in Table 3. 5. While the core is being filled, the rods are partially withdrawn to provide rapid shutdown if abnormal conditions should appear. The rods are fully inserted before the pump is started so that no cold slug accident could make the reactor critical. As the reactor is operated at power, the two manually controlled shim rods are kept well above the regulating rod to avoid a reduction in the sensitivity of the regulating rod by shadowing by the other two rods.

The MSRE fuel salt will always contain an inherent source of neutrons. Alpha particles from the uranium interact with the beryllium and fluorine to produce neutrons, and there is also a contribution from spontaneous fission. After high-power operation, the inherent source will be much stronger because of photoneutrons from the beryllium, produced by the fission product gamma rays.

Predicted source strengths are given in Table 3. 6. The spontaneous fission source is mostly from U235, while the U235 alphas are responsible for nearly all the alpha-n source. Thus, these sources differ for each fuel. The photoneutron neutron source depends on the fission product activity and the amount of beryllium in the core, which is about the same for each.

A review of the MSRE biological shielding design was completed. Special attention was given to irregularities in the annular shield around the reactor cell, and it was found that several areas will require additional local shielding. Most of this is required to lower the radiation level in the blower house, where the dose rate is 10 MW.

Operation would be ~140 mrems/hr with no additional shielding. Stacked concrete blocks can be placed conveniently to eliminate the contribution from the reactor cell, but levels in the blower house during 10-MW operation will range up to about 30 mrems/hr from the coolant salt in the radiator and piping. A block wall can be added around the blower house if.

The solid portion of the overhead shield will limit the dose rate to less than 2. 5 mrems/hr, except directly over the core where the estimated dose rate will be 16 mrems/hr. Much higher dose rates could exist over points where gaps between blocks overlap. Polyethylene and steel strips in the gaps and stacked concrete blocks can be used where needed to prevent excessive radiation through the top shield.

After the tubes in the MSRE heat exchanger were welded to the tubesheet at the front face, they were brazed into the tubesheet to increase the strength of the joint and to reduce the probability of a leak. The brazing was done at the Wall-Colmonoy Corporation by a method developed for this purpose and tested on the sample heat exchanger. Preplaced 82 wt% Au-18 wt% Ni brazing alloy was used in ring form.

The tube bundle was sealed in an all-welded retort to minimize the possibility of air leaks, and the system was evacuated and then purged with dry hydrogen (-80 to -65°F dew point) at a rate of 145 cfh. The use of a large, gas-fired pit furnace enabled the entire unit to be heated to brazing temperature, thus minimizing distortion due to differential thermal.

Visual inspection of the completed tube bundle showed that all components were bright, and all visible joints had good fillets. After the tube bundle was welded into its shell, both a helium-leak test and an 800-psi hydrostatic test were conducted. No leakage was found.

Since indications of this type and size had not been observed in the earlier work, there was no metallographic reference to which they could be compared. An attempt is being made to establish such a reference by brazing joints with discontinuities of approximately the right size. This reference should allow a better interpretation of the data and of the braze condition in the heat exchanger.

It has been common practice to assume that the value of a is constant, being 0.5 for all materials. Recent results of tensile tests at elevated temperature and the thermal-fatigue results show a to be related to the strain-hardening exponent n.

Where "n" is determined from the stress-strain relation. The thermal-fatigue characteristics show good agreement with the isothermal-fatigue data available on the alloy. Test results at maximum temperatures of 1300 and 1600°F show no appreciable difference in the Ae or N relation. Relaxation of elastic stress did occur during the hold time, and the plastic-strain value per cycle was therefore increased. As predicted by Eq. 1, the number of cycles was reduced by the increased plastic-strain range.

Equation 1 does not consider the manner in which the plastic strain is produced; thus, the time-dependent effects cannot be shown by this equation. In order to compare the thermal-fatigue behavior of INOR-8 to that of other common reactor materials, the rapid-thermal-cycling conditions were selected.

The range of temperature cycles to failure for INOR, Inconel, and type 304 stainless steel is shown in Figure 3. INOR-8 is shown to be superior to both the other materials by a substantial amount. These tests were performed under similar conditions: the specimen geometry, testing machine, cycle time, environment, and maximum temperature for all tests were nearly identical. Limited data on INOR-8 indicate a displacement of approximately one log cycle for a 40-min hold time at 1300°F. Data showing hold-time effects were not available for all the materials.

Twenty specimens will be irradiated in ORR Experiment 109. The post-irradiation tensile testing will be conducted at room temperature and within the irradiation temperature range. Both the strength and ductility of the irradiated specimens will be compared to the similar properties of the unirradiated control specimens.

Graphite bars (grade CGB) selected from material produced for the MSRE moderator are being evaluated for compliance with specifications and to establish properties data useful to the MSRE. This testing is for the purpose of establishing the general level of the property values and is not part of the quality control called for in the specification. Most of the tests were made on specimens from three graphite bars.

A measure of the tenaciously held oxygen of grade CGB graphite was determined by placing specimens in a closed system, evacuating the system to less than 10^-7 torr at room temperature, and then measuring the STP volume of carbon monoxide evolved from the graphite at 1800°C. The oxygen content of three lots (eight specimens) was determined to be 6 cm^3 of CO (STP) per 100 cm^3 of graphite by this procedure. This was well under the maximum of 30 cm^3 of CO (STP) per 100 cm^3 of graphite permitted by the specification.

Tests were continued to determine if salt-filled cracks in CGB graphite would be propagated by thermal cycling through a temperature range that includes the melting point of the salt. In previous work, the temperature range from the liquidus temperature (930°F) to 1830°F is approximately.

There were no detectable changes in the graphite specimens or their cracks as a result of these high-temperature thermal cycles. They exceeded. The slowest of the high-temperature thermal cycles was more than 200 times faster in reaching 1300°F than the maximum preheating rate.

The effect of neutron irradiation on the mechanical and physical properties of grade CGB graphite is being investigated. Fifty specimens have been irradiated in the ORR to dose levels from 2 to 5 x 10^6 nvt (E > 0. 18 MeV). The irradiation temperatures of the specimens varied with the flux and were from 700 to 1050°F. The effect of this irradiation.

The electrical resistivity of grade CGB graphite was determined at 27°C in the directions perpendicular to and parallel with the extrusion direction (length) of the bar, on control specimens for the irradiation test. The thermal conductivity values were calculated from the electrical resistivity and are compared with those originally estimated for the MSRE graphite. The results are summarized below.

This comparison indicates that the thermal conductivity of the graphite may be better than was originally expected and that the graphite is slightly more anisotropic than expected.

The use of molten NaF-ZrF4-UF4 (50-46-4 mole %) to remove oxygen from a moderately permeable graphite, grade R-0025, was demonstrated under conditions similar to those proposed for purging the MSRE. Work was concentrated on this salt because it appeared to be more effective than the.

In early work, the ratio of the volume of the molten salt to the bulk volume of a graphite crucible was 1:27, and the purging salt was allowed to freeze in the crucible before it was removed. There was some scatter in the results from duplicate tests, presumably due to incomplete removal of the frozen salt and/or to the relatively small quantity used.

The proposed flush-salt operation of the MSRE differs from this method in that the salt will be introduced and removed from the reactor in the molten state; thus, the ratio of the total volume of the molten salt to the bulk volume of the graphite in the reactor will be 1:1. The larger quantity of salt and its removal in the molten state, as proposed for the MSRE, offered more effective conditions for cleaning the graphite than did the conditions of the early laboratory tests.

The purged crucibles were then charged with the oxygen-sensitive LiF-BeFs-UF4 (62-37-1 mole %) salt in an inert atmosphere and held at 1300°F for 4000 hr. This salt readily precipitates uranium dioxide in the presence of oxygen  Radiographic tests did not detect any uranium oxide precipitate forming. Similar tests will be made with R-0025 and (66-34 mole %) as soon as this salt is available.

A study was completed to develop procedures for fabricating thin-walled cylinders of Gd2O3 that contain up to 30 wt% Al2O3. These cylinders are of interest as control rod elements for the MSRE, and their composition was designed to withstand moisture in the atmosphere at temperatures up to 1400°F. The Al2O3 was added to minimize hydrolysis and subsequent deterioration of the Gd2O3.

The formation of a low-temperature-melting compound, identified by X-ray diffraction analysis as the primary perovskite-type phase GdAl03. The distortion was minimized by the use of pre-reacted powder; however, some flaring of the ends of the cylinders still occurred owing to frictional restraint during sintering.

A technique was investigated in which a pressed specimen of pre-reacted material was supported on a similar, but shorter, dummy specimen so that the frictional restraint was sustained by the supporting member. By this, up to 5. 26 g/cm³ were attained, with minor dimensional changes, by thermal cycling the parts between 1635 and 1660°C. However, this technique is not considered practical for making large quantities of the material.

The results of this work indicate that shapes of controlled size and density can be fabricated by the use of standard cold-pressing and sintering techniques if pre-reacted powders are used. Distortion due to frictional restraint of the shrinking parts during the sintering operation can be minimized by the use of supporting members also made of pre-reacted powders.

Assembly ORNL-MTR-47-4, which has been described previously, contained capsules of INOR-8 enclosing graphite and MSRE fuel. In four of the capsules, 1/2-in. diameter cylindrical cores of graphite (5 g) were immersed in 25 g of MSRE-type fuel. After an exposure of about 107° nvt in the MTR, the capsules were punctured, and the cover gas was collected for analyses. Much gaseous F6 was found. In conformance with results from earlier irradiations, in which gaseous Fp must also have been present, there was little if any of the expected xenon from fissioning. This was attributed to the formation of solid compounds such as XeFs, XeF8, and XeF6, which have relatively low vapor pressures.

After the graphite cores were removed from capsules 45 and 12 and examined, they were stored in screw-cap plastic bottles for five months. The necessary manipulations involved many hours of exposure to hot-cell air. On removal from storage, the graphite was heated under vacuum, and the evolved gases were collected for analysis by mass spectrometry. The gas samples were taken following periods of at least 1 hr each at 600, 800, and 1000°C. In the case of capsule 45, the xenon released from the fissioning. A considerable amount of SiF4 (~3 cm) was also in the gas. The source of the silicon, other than what might have come from the stainless steel vacuum tank and lines and from the glass manifold, is not known. 0. 065 cm of xenon was recovered at 600°C along with insignificant amounts at higher temperatures, which again amounted. This time the fluorine appeared as CF4 (~0. 4 cm), and little SiF4 was noted, in contrast with the behavior in the absence of an air leak.

The xenon fluorides should not have remained as such in the graphite during the long exposure to air because of both their sublimation pressure and their reactivity to form the nonvolatile XeOg. The XeOg molecule has a dipole moment and should adsorb on graphite much more readily than the symmetrical XeF; however, the dipole moment of XeOg is probably not large because of the compensating effect of the unshared electrons on the xenon atom at the apex of a triangular pyramid with three oxygens at the base at Xe-O distances of 1. 76 Å and O-Xe-O angles of 103°. Oxygen that might have resulted from the decomposition of XeO3 during the heating was apparently converted to CO.

As recovered from the heating in a stainless steel apparatus, the graphite from capsule 45 was found to be coated with a silvery film resembling, in appearance, some previously encountered surface deposits of chromium and/or iron carbides on graphite. In an attempt to identify the film, the top of the graphite core was placed in a mounting, as for metallographic preparations, and subjected to X-ray analysis. The X-ray pattern resembled that for U0s, which led to the conclusion that the film had been inadvertently removed, and that the X-ray pattern resulted from the presence of uranium in the surface graphite beneath the film. The occurrence of uranium in the graphite was confirmed by chemical analyses.

Because of the repeated cycling through strongly oxidizing and reducing cycles as a consequence of F4 generation during reactor shutdowns, the contents of capsules from assembly ORNL-MTR-47-4 had an uncertain environmental history. As a check on possible alterations, chemical analyses were made of the graphite cores from three irradiated capsules and a control capsule. Large pieces, 0.8 g or larger, in which the surface-to-mass ratio was similar to that of the original, were dissolved in a boiling mixture of sulfuric and nitric acids. The uranium was analyzed by a fluorometric method, the other constituents were analyzed by emission spectra, except for lithium, which was analyzed by.

The analyses presented in Table 5.1 show increasing uranium contents with capsule power, which in turn correlates with the intensity of the ff-equilibrium cycles associated with shutdowns. The unirradiated sample, which had been exposed to a thermal history the same as that of the irradiated samples, did not absorb any appreciable amounts of uranium or lithium. Graphite from capsules 12, 45, and 3A was subjected to bakeout of gases at 1000°C, which may have caused changes in the constituents analyzed, and graphite from capsule 36 was not analyzed because it was involved in an attempt to recover fuel by melting. On a per atom basis, there is more lithium than uranium in the graphite cores, while the other major constituents of the fuel are virtually absent.

Speculations regarding the mechanism by which uranium occurred in the graphite have dealt mainly with two possibilities: (1) Transport of UFe seemed possible as a consequence of the Fo atmosphere, but graphite alone was not regarded as an adequate reducing agent for fixation of UF.

In the cores, strongly reduced salt was probably in brief contact with the graphite during startup periods before the released F's could be re-equilibrated into the melt. Autoradiography of metallographically mounted cross sections of graphite revealed that the radioactivity in the cores was highly concentrated in a narrow band at the surface.

Fission Product Activities in Graphite Exposed to Fissioning Fuel. Analyses by gamma spectrometry of the fission product activities of Ce, Cs, Ru, and Zr found in the graphite were of interest for comparisons of the calculated burnup of the uranium in the graphite with that in the fuel. The conversion of activity to apparent percent burnup, shown in Table 5. 2, gave considerable scatter, much of which was due to transport of the fission species after formation. Cesium activity may have entered the pores of the graphite as xenon gas, and ruthenium activity may have been reduced from the salt phase and deposited on the graphite. The zirconium activity was unreliable because of the low activity level at the time of analysis. Cerium activity showed a rather low but constant value and was probably the most reliable index. The implication was that the averaged fraction of the exposure undergone by uranium in the graphite was one-third to one-sixth that for the fuel or that most of the uranium found in the graphite had been there only during the later exposure cycles in the MTR.

As described earlier, two of the capsules (0. 67 and 0. 34 mole % UF4 fuel, respectively) in the irradiated assembly ORNL-MTR-4-7-5 were like those in the previous irradiation experiment, except that they were provided with gas sampling lines through which capsule gas was swept into evacuated 250-ml collection cylinders after having accumulated in the capsule under a nominally static helium pressure (12 psia). Conditions during the accumulation periods ranged from ambient temperature during shutdowns to temperatures of 815°C at fission power densities of 85 w/em in LiF-BeFs-ZrF4-UF4 (~67-28-4-0. 67 mole %).

Of the 61 samples collected, 33 were obtained from fissioning molten fuel, and of these about 14 from the 0.67 mole% UF6 fuel and 15 from the 0. 34 mole% fuel appeared to be useful. In the digest of results at operating temperatures presented in this section, four samples have been neglected. Although three of these contained measurable amounts of CF4, their history and analyses involved irregularities that were not clear.

The varying radioactivity of the samples, which in many cases necessitated several transfers before introduction of marginally small amounts into the mass spectrometer, led to considerable variation in the sensitivity of analyses. An estimated approximate lower limit for measurement of about 5 ppm of CF had been considered feasible on the basis of calibration trials with the collection apparatus. Most of the samples were analyzed for Fp at K-25 and twice again for CF, and other constituents by different mass spectrometry laboratories (ORNL and Y-12). Noticeably greater sensitivity of measurement was attained on the later reanalyses where radioactivity was no longer a problem. In general, the latest figures were adopted as most representative, although again there were large fluctuations from sample to sample in the amount that could have been present (below the limit of detection) in the 18 samples that gave negative results.

The amount of xenon (long-lived) in a sample served as an internal dosimeter and measured the exposure in terms of the relative amounts of fission energy that were released while the samples accumulated. The amounts of CF4 in a sample were presented as ratios of CF4 to xenon in the same sample for the following reasons: (1) the primary generation of CF4 is probably strongly influenced by the energy, as is, of course, certainly true of xenon; (2) comparison of mass spectrometric peaks on the same sample eliminates many possible discrepancies that might stem from unrecognized differences in sampling; and (3) also a convenient reference factor is available for assessing the chemical effects on fuels of any given loss of fluoride as CF4. The excess of fluoride ions arising from fissioning UF6, because the fission product cation valences for equilibrium with the container do not accommodate the available anions from the fissioned UF4, gives a small increase in oxidizing power of the fuel with increasing burnup. Ordinarily, this oxidation should, in principle, be manifested as a relatively insignificant increase in corrosion product concentration. However, if the moles of CF4 evolved from a fuel were approximately equal to the gram atoms of stable xenon produced during the same interval, the oxidation-reduction level would tend to remain favorably balanced.

The exact ratio for balance varies with conditions of operation but for purposes of estimation can be considered as unity or a little higher. Thus, the cross-hatched bands at the top of Figs. 5. 1 and 5. 2 denote the upper limit of the CF4/Xe ratios below which the removal of CF4 is a corrosion problem of negligible proportions for the MSRE. For higher rates of fluoride removal that could conceivably require occasional re-treatment of the fuel with HF, a chemical margin of tolerance (due to the approach to sufficient reduction to deposit uranium) would be encountered only after an appreciable reduction of UF6 to UF6.

Estimated limits of sensitivity for each of the samples that were given for use as upper limits. The shaded area shows the locus of points corresponding to about 5 ppm CF4, and the open circles correspond to samples for which definite CF4 contents were found. Taking into account both positive and negative samples, if CF4 were present in amounts proportional to xenon production, the quantity was too small to be measured with certainty. On the other hand, there was a possibility that CF4 underwent decomposition and/or reaction with the wall because of the radiation field in the capsule. Thus, the amount present in samples collected over trial extrapolations to zero time, effectively at least, and thus show a possible relative primary rate of generation of CF4 compared to xenon in the vapor space in the capsule. In principle, a curve for CF4 concentration should pass through all open circles and beneath all filled ones, but because of the scatter of the data, the curves remained indeterminate. However, the trial values obtained from the dashed extrapolations were considered representative of the rate of production of CF4 that could have prevailed. Thus, the conclusion would be reached that CF4 was produced in the vapor space at about 6% of the rate of xenon, and that a steady-state concentration at, or just under, 5 ppm CF4 was approached.

A simple basis, though not a rigorous or necessarily correct one, for scaling such results from capsules to a reactor could be the assumption that for a given power density in the fuel, the CF4 production was proportional to the area of the interface between graphite and fuel.

After 2000 hours of irradiation in the MTR at an average thermal-neutron flux of 2 x 10^13 neutrons cm^(-2) sec^(-1), the 47-5 experiment was withdrawn, and valves were attached to the gas sweep lines in preparation for shipment. Within 11-1/2 days after termination of the exposure, the assembly was installed in an ORNL hot cell with pressure-measuring devices attached to both gas-swept capsules. A gas sample withdrawn from the low-power capsule (0. 34 mole % UF4) contained 38% He and 55% F2 by mass spectrometric analysis. It also contained large amounts of tellurium and iodine activities (40 r/hr at contact through a nickel wall).

After the measurement of the room-temperature fluorine evolution rates, the variation of the rate with capsule temperature was studied. Rates were measured at 50, 86, -70, and 2°C, with intermittent room-temperature determinations to provide a norm for comparison. The data for the first 95 days are shown in Fig. 3, together with a calculated fluorine generation curve based on a G value of 0. 04 molecules of Fs per 100 eV of fission product decay energy (calorimetrically-determined data for decay power were used since energy absorbed in the fuel was needed). In Fig. 5. 4, the same data on fluorine liberation are represented in integral form, and as indicated by the points near the origin, there were losses of F₀ from the capsules during shutdowns between reactor cycles; these losses were equivalent to increments of chemical reduction of the fuel. The accumulated effects, shown in terms of the extent of expected reduction of UF₄ to UF₆ in Table 5. 3, caused the fuel (rather early in its history) to be reduced to the point that some disproportionation of UF₆ could have been expected. Appreciable deposition of uranium, particularly in the capsule with higher power density, must have occurred before the exposure.

Further evolution of F₀ after termination led to cumulative losses, in terms of the total fluoride content of the fuel, of 2% and 4% for the low- and high-power capsules respectively (nominal experimental design powers were 35 and 65 W/em³).

Fluorine evolution rates were much less strongly influenced by the degree of reduction of the fuel salt than by the temperature. The chemical reduction indicated in 0. 4 would have, in molten fuel, caused violent chemical changes, such as the precipitation of all of the uranium and some of the other cations as metals.

In order to explore further the nature of the recombination of fluorine with reduced salt at elevated temperatures, several additional variations were made in fluorine pressure as well as capsule temperature. Fluorine pressures from a fraction of 1 psia to 1 atm, and capsule temperatures from 33 to 88°C were studied. A final test was run to determine whether the radiolysis of CF, at 1 atm of pressure by 150-day-cooled fuel salt might be detectable.

The following detailed description explains in part some of the peculiarities and complications in 0.5. Both capsules were evacuated after the 87°C interval that ended on day 95, and fluorine evolution with no added pressure was followed for 15 days at 33°C to furnish a base line. The observations under these conditions were extended over 15 days because the evolution rate continued to rise slowly, in line with previous observations that room-temperature rates were not immediately recovered after the salt had been heated. On heating to 83°C, the 0. 67 mole % UF4 salt rapidly consumed the generated F2, the pressure falling. The 0.34 mole % UF4 capsule slowly dropped to zero, confirming previous behavior. On day 113, the temperature was raised to 68°C, the capsules were evacuated, and 1 psia of fresh F2 was added to each. The initial consumption rate in the 0.39 psia and then decreased. Fluorine was again added to 1 psia, and the consumption rate nearly reproduced the previous gyration. At 1 psia and 88°C, the 0.34 mole % UF4 salt slowly.

The capsules were sampled and evacuated, and 0. 5 atm of F0 was added to each. The more concentrated fuel consumed Fs at approximately twice the 1l-psia rate for three days, then less rapidly as the Fz pressure decreased to 0. 25 atm. A similar doubling of its 1-psia rate occurred in the other capsule.

The capsules were again sampled and evacuated, and a full atmosphere of Fₒ was added to each. Again, the consumption rate in the concentrated fuel did not quite reach the previous maximum rate at 0. 5 atm Fₛ, possibly because salt accessible to Fₛ had become partially saturated. A similar rate decrease was noted in the other capsule.

On day 122, the assembly temperature was reduced to 34°C, leaving slightly less than 1 atm of Fp in each capsule. In both capsules, fluorine generation was rather quickly resumed at rates similar to the initial baseline rates. Curiously, there was now little if any change in rate in 12 days of continued evolution; otherwise, the addition of F to the fluoride-deficient salt apparently had not enhanced subsequent Fo liberation. In fact, the slightly lower rates could perhaps have been considered indicative of a slight back-reaction at 1 atm of Fs at 34°C.

With the F's pressure maintained near 1 atm, the capsule temperature was raised to 54°C. The 0.67 mole % UF capsule began to consume F's slowly. The other capsule exhibited the small burst of Fo often observed after temperature rises, followed by a decrease of generation rate. 34 mole % UF salt showed another small Fp burst and then leveled at a low positive generation rate. The 0.67 mole % UF salt consumed F's at a moderate rate at 74°C, showing an erratic rate behavior. Such irregular behavior is common in gas-solid reactions involving successive formation and rupture of partially protective films. Finally, when the temperature was again raised to 88°C, the consumption rate for the more-reduced salt increased to a value only one-fourth its previous value at 88°C and 1 atm F's and then fell off strongly. This is again suggestive of saturation of the outer surfaces of the fuel salt by Fo. At 88°C, the 0.34 mole % UF salt gave off another slow Fo burst that lasted more than two days before consumption dominated. It appeared that the 0.34 mole % UF capsule was more prone to such bursts at 1 atm of Fp overpressure than at 1 psia overpressure.

The capsules were again sampled, evacuated, and cooled to 38°C. An atmosphere of CF4 was added to both capsules and allowed to remain for four days. The apparent negative rates for both capsules for the first day were probably due to a slight drop in capsule temperature, causing an out of a total pressure of 14.7 psia. For the remaining three days, approximately normal generation rates were observed. Analyses of the CF4 before and after radiolysis were identical except for the expected small Fp concentration from salt radiolysis.

For reasons implicit in the foregoing discussion, exact relations between F's pressure and recombination rates are not derivable from the available data. Qualitatively, however, the initial reaction rate of fluorine with a highly reduced fuel was approximately proportional to fluorine pressure. As the reaction continued, the reaction order fell to 0.5 and less.

Conclusions Pertaining to Reactor Operation: Fluorine generation is expected to be negligibly slow from solid MSRE fuel salt which had been fissioning at 65 w/cm², provided its temperature is maintained above, e. g. , 200°C. The possibility of F₅ release from molten fuel is even more remote, in view of the higher temperature and improved kinetics for fluorine back-reaction in the liquid state.

The net fluorine liberation rate depends on the balance of at least three effects: (1) the primary radiolytic generation rate, which is probably temperature-independent; (2) chemical recombination of fluorine inside the crystals with the reduced radiolytic species, e. g. , Li, Be, S, and U°; and (3) a temperature-dependent diffusion step for the escape of internal F° or Fₛ from the crystal. At low temperatures, the slowing of diffusion would decrease net Fₒ liberation, perhaps simultaneously building up higher internal pressures of Fₛ, which give rise to bursts of released gas when the salt is warmed. At high temperatures, accelerated.

Recombination of Fs with reduced products would result in the observed zero or negative formation rates. Schematically, this results in an overall pattern like that in Fig. 7, but because the onset of the recombination reaction depends on the condition of the fuel and the presence of Fp, the temperature scale in Fig.

The production of fluorine-containing gases in reactor-irradiated MSRE fuel-salt compatibility tests raised the question of whether such behavior arose from the effect of radiation (possibly internal) on the solid salt. One phase of the experiments exploring this problem consisted of exposing such a fuel salt, otherwise unirradiated but in contact with graphite, to gamma irradiation in the 10,000-curie Co60 facility of the ORNL Chemical Technology Division.

The container was equipped with gas tubing and valves, pressure-measuring instruments, and a sampling tank assembly to obtain gas samples. The complete apparatus involved in pressure measurement and gas collection was prefluorinated by K-25 Plant personnel. After the salt was loaded around the graphite, melted, and refrozen in a glove box under a dry inert atmosphere, the lid was welded in place, and the assembly was flushed and filled with purified helium at a pressure slightly above atmospheric.

The salt was exposed in the Co&° facility at ambient temperature (50 to 60°C). For about 600 hr, no significant variation (<0. 3%) in gas pressure was observed (Gr, = 0). After this time, pressure began to rise at a mildly accelerating rate. At hour 1343, the pressure had risen and held there until hour 1724. The pressure changed during this period at 67°C (ambient) until hour 1870.

The increases in pressure due to the evolution of F's are consistent with the observation of radiation damage to LiF and other alkali halides, as summarized by Billington and Crawford. Displacement of fluorine atoms by any of various forms of radiation ultimately leads to the escape of fluorine atoms or molecules from the crystal. Since the return to the vacancies in the solid lattice is probably an extremely slow process for molecular fluorine, the accumulation of a substantial fluorine pressure after an induction period would not be unlikely. Similar effects have evidently been encountered in the reactor-irradiated salts due to fission product activity during the decay period.

250 kV, 3 kVA. All experiments were made with the maximum input to the machines at 250 kVp (GE) or 250 kV (Muller). In spite of the use of direct current in the Muller unit, dosimetry indicated an absorbed dose rate of only 0. 3 relative to that for the GE unit.

Irradiation vessels were fabricated from nickel with diaphragms of energy into the salt. The inside surfaces were well-fluorinated at 150°C before introduction of the salt. The salts were handled only in a helium dry box and were recrystallized by melting in nickel crucibles in order to keep the carbon content as low as possible. Generally, a 75-to 100-g sample of salt was sufficient to form a layer about 0. 75 in. deep over the area of the x-ray beam.

Dosimetry measurements were made with ferrous sulfate. The dosimeter solution (5. 5 liters) was placed just below the irradiation vessel in a container with a solution depth of 8 inches, large enough to intercept the total beam. The amounts of energy absorbed by the test salts were determined by the difference between that energy passing through an empty vessel and that passing through the vessel containing the sample. This dosimeter is satisfactory for use with photon energies as low as 50 kV. However, the depth of the solution was insufficient to stop all the high-energy x-rays.

Out with this salt in helium at 1 atm using the GE machine. A 100-g sample absorbed energy at the rate of 5 x 10^19 eV/min, but, owing to difficulties with the machine, it was not possible to irradiate for long periods of time. The first experiment (135 min, 6. 6 x 10^+ eV absorbed) resulted in the liberation of 267 ppm COFs and 174 ppm CF in 24 ml of helium, as determined by mass spectrometry, and indicated a G value of 0. 006 molecules of Fs liberated per 100 eV of energy absorbed. A second irradiation of the same salt 425 min, 1. The value used for calculating G values was the total found in the CF and other compounds of fluorine. There were no significant differences between the irradiated and as-received salt as determined by carbon and oxygen analyses, x-ray diffraction, and microscopic examination. In both cases, the oxygen content was ~200 ppm, and the carbon content was <300 ppm.

Further irradiations were carried out on another sample of the same fuel-salt mixture with the Muller machine. With an input to the tube of 250 kV at 12 mA, the dose absorbed by the fuel salt was about 1.3 x 10^16 eV/min for a 110-g sample. The salt was loaded into the fluorinated vessel in a helium dry box and was treated with F2 at 150°C until the consumption rate was low. During this fluorination, appreciable amounts of CF4, COF2, and SiF4 were detected. After the fluorination, the vessel was thoroughly purged with helium and left with 1 psig of helium overnight before analysis. Mass spectrometer analysis of the internal gas showed no trace of F2, CF4, or COF2.

The salt was irradiated for 22 hours (1.6 x 10^6 eV absorbed) in helium at 1 atm. Gas analysis showed 280 ppm F2 and 230 ppm CF4, with only traces of COFs and SiF4, in 20 ml of helium. The G value from these data (1077 eV absorbed) gave similar results, with a G value of 0. 00.

The vessel containing the above salt was heated for 16 hours at 250°C at a pressure of 3 to 4 atm to remove any adsorbed gases. Two subsequent tests did yield appreciable quantities of CF4 and COFs. The calculated gas removal from the vessel indicated an oxygen content of about 1800 ppm. If this resulted from in-leakage of air during the heating, it could explain the failure to detect F2 in the gas after irradiation.

A 75 g sample of ZrF was irradiated on the Muller unit (250 kV, 12 mA) for a total of 269 hr (1.4 x 10^7 eV absorbed) without evidence of fluorine evolution. This sample of salt, in its irradiation vessel, was thoroughly fluorinated to remove any carbon, sulfur, or silicon impurities and to convert metal oxides to fluorides after the above exposure. It was then irradiated for 65 hr (3.

A 50 g sample of LiF was irradiated for 333 hours under similar conditions. Owing to the low mass absorption coefficient of LiF, this exposure resulted in absorption of 3 x 10^10 eV. Gas analysis failed to detect liberation of fluorine or gaseous fluorine compounds in the helium cover gas. This LiF was fluorinated in its irradiation vessel and consumed appreciable fluorine before the consumption rate became negligible.

Evidence to date implies that X-ray photons of 250 kV and less can cause radiolysis of metal fluoride mixtures under certain conditions. It appears that the individual component salts may be less susceptible to decomposition than the mixtures, and it is entirely possible that the presence of impurity salts may drastically affect the G value for fluorine.

As mentioned previously, experiments to investigate the effect of beta radiation on fluorine evolution from solid, MSRE-type fused salt have been in progress. These were initiated to establish whether irradiation of the solid salt results in the evolution of fluorine in amounts required to explain the amounts found in in-pile capsule tests. An important objective was the evaluation of Gp as a function of several variables, including irradiation dose, dose rate, and crystal size in the salt. Observations have also been made on the effect of different dose rates on Gp and on changes in crystallite size in the salt as a result of the irradiations. The experiments and results to date are summarized in the following paragraphs.

Experimental. The procedure involved exposing particles of solid fused salt to fast electrons and determining gain or loss of fluorine in the irradiation cell (0. 8) due to the irradiation. The cell was filled to atmospheric pressure with a mixture of known amounts of helium and fluorine (4 to 6% fluorine) prior to irradiation.

Control loss or gain comprised a major part of the experimental work. The addition of a fluorine-helium mixture was adopted as a method of minimizing fluorine loss to the cell and of favoring the formation of a steady state with respect to the amount of fluorine sorbed by the salt. A summary of some other experimental conditions is given in Table 5. 4.

Fluorine analyses were made by spectrophotometric measurement of the amount of iodine formed during the passage of a gas sample through KI solution. A few check analyses of the composition of cell gases by the mass spectrographic method were also obtained.

Provisions were made with auxiliary equipment for (1) evacuation of the cell and connecting lines; (2) fluorination of the system; (3) addition of purified helium; (4) addition of fluorine-helium control samples; and (5) sweeping of gas from the cell through KI solution. The cell was removed from the auxiliary equipment for filling with salt and for irradiations.

Results: The results of the exposures of the cell without salt showed that fluorine was released at a low rate throughout the 12-hour irradiation. The rate increased with dose to a maximum of about 10 µg/hr. The control experiments made at intervals between irradiation experiments showed a continuing loss of fluorine to the cell and/or salt throughout each group of experiments. In the latter case, relative release rates were of primary interest, and these were considered accurate to about ±10%.

A mass spectrographic analysis of the gas contained in a cell after a 1-hr irradiation at 0. 97 Pa showed the following percentage composition: to Os indicates air contamination. This contamination could have occurred during the transfer to the mass spectrograph.

The results of fluorine evolution rate measurements are shown in Figure 9. The filled circles represent the average rate observed during comparison with in-pile capsule data of others. The dose regions in which this value of Gp was obtained from pressure-rise measurements that were made on the capsules in a hot cell beginning about 11 days after termination of in-pile irradiation. When measurements were made on these capsules in-pile during the initial reactor shutdown, the dose reached 2 to 3 x 10^7 eV/g before any pressure change occurred.

The results of these experiments have demonstrated that fluorine is evolved in substantial amounts from solid MSRE fuel under electron irradiation; in this respect, this irradiation system is similar to the in-pile capsule systems and to other out-of-pile irradiation systems which are under investigation.

There were rather large differences between the GRE values observed in this work and those reported for the in-pile capsules from Experiment 47-5. These were largest at the low dose levels. The experimental conditions and materials employed in the two investigations differed, of course, in several respects. Among the factors which differed and which cannot be discounted as possible sources of the difference in results are (1) dose rates, (2) size and method of preparation of solid samples, (3) presence of graphite in contact with the salt in the in-pile capsules, and (4) extent of reduction of the fuel occasioned by previous loss of F-0. Temperature differences, which were small in some experiments, and minor initial differences in fuel composition were probably not responsible for the differences in results. This statement regarding the effect of salt composition is based on considerations of preliminary results of cobalt source irradiations of salt reported by Compere and coworkers. Their test material and that used in the Van de Graaff experiments were taken from the same stock of salt.

Further experiments in which the effects of dose rates are observed throughout longer exposure periods are required to elucidate the dose rate effects in general and, in particular, to establish whether an effect of dose rate exists at the steady state.

Preliminary trials to determine the stability of CF under gamma irradiation have been carried out in prefluorinated cells of nickel. The amounts of fluorine obtained thus far after exposures of up to six weeks are much smaller than those corresponding to G values (0. 1 to 0. 3) in the literature.

As part of the program to provide improved fuels, blankets, and fluid coolant for the Molten-Salt Reactor Program, continuing investigations of the crystallization equilibria in useful fluoride systems have included comprehensive studies not only of liquidus-solidus behavior but also solid-state equilibria and crystal chemistry as well. These studies have led to generalizations with respect to molten-salt phase behavior and crystal chemistry and have provided a basis for meaningful diagnoses of off-performance difficulties encountered in engineering tests.

For some time, the choice of salt systems to be investigated as a solvent for UF and other quadrivalent fluorides of interest to MSRE has been narrowed to LiF-BeF2. Complete phase diagrams, determined either at ORNL or at Mound Laboratory, are now available for nearly all the limiting binary and ternary systems involved in both LiF-BeF2-ThF4-UF4 and NaF-BeF2-ThF4-UF4 equilibria. With one exception, reports in the open literature have now been made on each of the limiting systems.

By 1958, it was apparent that economic development of a reactor technology based on NaF-BeF2 was unlikely in the United States because the inventory requirement was 1.1 to 2 times the amount of U-235 required for the LiF-BeF2 salt, and there was a recognized disadvantage of 0.1 to 0.15 in the regeneration ratio. A typical fuel composition of interest at this time, with a token amount of ThF4, to demonstrate compatibility in breeder systems, was LiF-BeF2-ThF4-UF4 (65-30-4-1 mole %) (mp ~450°C). The secondary coolant composition to be used in conjunction with this fuel was LiF-BeF2 (66-34 mole %).

By 1960, as the conceptual design of the MSRE reached an advanced point, there was increasing concern about the precipitation of UOs by oxide contamination. Accordingly, the fuel composition was revised so that a sufficient amount of ZrF was present to ensure that any oxide precipitation that might occur would be in the form of ZrO rather than UOs. Enough thorium was again retained to demonstrate the mutual compatibility of the proposed fuel for the MSRE. A governing consideration in the choice of this and subsequent compositions was the selection of a maximum LiF.

The content should have a melting point lower than that of the coolant. The equilibrium relations of all mixtures, which could be formed on preparing this composition by adding a liquid mixture of the LiF-UF eutectic to the appropriate LiF-BeF2-ZrF4-ThF4 solvent, were explored in detail to determine the safety of bringing the reactor to criticality by titrating with the LiF-UF mixture. The phase behavior was such that segregation of the three tetrafluorides (ZrF4, ThF4, UF4) presented no serious problem in MSRE operation, but the omission of ThF4, which simplified some aspects of the operation, led to similar but somewhat less complex fuel systems. One of the compositions, characterized by the maximum amount of UF4 required for clean criticality, contains only 0. 15 mole % of UF4. So low a required concentration essentially reduced the equilibrium phase relations to those in the system LiF-BeF2-ZrF4. To provide a larger oxidation-reduction buffer in the fuel and also as additional protection in case of inadvertent precipitation of uranium, a dilution of UO2F2 with UF3Pr was invoked in formulating a fuel with 0. 83 mole % of UF4. With this added safeguard, the fuel composition specified for first operation in the MSRE synthesis of this melt will be carried out in the reactor by addition of.

In the course of determining the liquid-solid relations at low LiF concentrations in the system LiF-BeF2-ZrF4, evidence was obtained that two immiscible liquids are formed above the ZrF4 primary phase field. Such immiscibility is quite rare in molten electrolytes and had not been heretofore encountered in molten fluorides under study in connection with reactor use. While the composition-temperature relations of the two-liquid immiscibility gap have not been established, the two-liquid region apparently extends at least from 25 to 70 mole% of ZrF4 and from 5 to 20 mole% of LiF in its extremities. The monotectic temperature plane below the two-liquid region, at which the equilibrium phases are solid ZrF4 and two liquids, ranges from 786 to 529°C as the ZrF4 concentration changes from 25 to 70 mole%. The physical properties, particularly the viscosity, of these liquids are unattractive from the standpoint of many practical applications.

Data giving evidence of the two-liquid region were obtained on equilibrating mixtures of purified fluorides and quenching from high temperature. Specimens obtained from such experiments contain spheroidal glass fragments along with those of a partially devitrified glass, as shown in.

In 2, two varieties of glass are shown. Liquid immiscibility was not reported in a recent investigation of the system BeF2-ZrF4 in the Russian literature. However, since visual data were not obtained, the immiscible liquids might have been present though not detected. Among the other questionable aspects of the Russian phase diagram are a melting temperature of BeF2 of 793°C rather than the generally accepted 545°C, a solid-state transition of BeF2 at 680°C, and also a regular group of thermal peaks at 578°C. Current work at ORNL is directed toward clarification of the ambiguities connected with the BeF2-ZrF4 phase diagram.

The identifiable phases, from in-pile capsules and from Van de Graaff irradiations, possessed optical properties which were somewhat altered from those of the same phases in unirradiated salt. The LiF in irradiated samples was brown, but the refractive index remained unchanged. The compound 2LiF-BeFs was brownish-purple, and the more intensely colored material had a range of refractive indices. The color change was observable at dose levels too low to cause measurable changes in refractive.

The change in composition of the liquid by evaporation, as evidenced in a series of samples by a decrease in the relative amount of low refractive index material (<1. 393) and the presence of well-crystallized LiF, was attributed to a vapor composition richer in BeF₅ than the fuel. The appearance of the distillate indicated that the composition change was most extensive in the most highly irradiated materials, probably because of the higher temperatures involved.

In a given series, capsules that were most highly irradiated contained the best crystallized material. This may have been caused by a reduced rate of cooling as a result of greater fission product afterheat. However, a similar crystal growth was observed in electron-irradiated samples for which the temperatures remained well below the solidus. This observation was surprising. The effect was not detected in crystals that received x-rays at relatively small doses, such as 102 eV/g. The growth, apparently a consequence of radiation rather than a heat effect, remains unexplained and will require further investigation.

The range of particle sizes found in the in-pile capsules suggests that the surface area of the solids could have differed by an order of magnitude from capsule to capsule. This may favor a recombination of released fluorine, as, for example, in capsule 6 of ORNL MTR-47, which contained very finely divided material and little F's, according to Weaver.

The large proportion of opaque and fine materials, as well as the extensive radiation damage, provides a need for X-ray diffraction data to supplement the petrographic results. This is because, in addition to the identification of phases, knowledge of structural changes in the radiation-damaged materials might have both theoretical and practical interest. For instance, if it were established that fluorine is released selectively from one phase rather than from the entire salt, perhaps a composition for MSR fuels could be selected that would not yield the Fo-generating phase on freezing.

Further studies on the xenon fluorides by X-ray diffraction techniques established the existence of a compound with the formula XeF₄:XeF₂, and its crystal structure was determined. This substance was readily crystallized from vapor containing a mixture of XeF₆ and XeF₄, and crystals of about 1 mm were grown. No other intermediate compound in this binary system could be detected. The compound should have been present at some stage in irradiated MSRE capsules, but too little is known of its chemical behavior to confirm the surmise that XeF₄ or XeF₂ was the species present at the time gas samples were taken from capsules.

The crystal structure consists of an array of discrete XeF5 and XeF3 molecules, whose symmetries and dimensions are the same as in crystals of the component phases. Since contacts between molecules in XeF5-XeF3 are not significantly closer than intermolecular distances in either of the components, the new phase is described as a molecular addition compound.

Investigations of temperature-composition relations in several molten salt systems of potential use in the development of a molten-salt fast breeder reactor were initiated recently. The guiding requirements were (1) that the core and blanket fluids remain as homogeneous fluids at temperatures above 550 to 600°C, (2) that the core fluid, a chloride mixture, contain 35 to 55 at. % of fissionable species, and (4%) that the blanket fluid, a fluoride mixture, contain ~25 at. % of thorium and be capable of dissolving an additional amount (5 to 7 at. %) of uranium and plutonium at operating temperatures. Although several of the binary systems of UCls, UCl4, and PuCl4 with the alkali chlorides or alkaline-earth chlorides are well known, information for somewhat more complicated mixtures of UCl4 and PuCl4 was necessary to obtain the requisite combinations. Accordingly, the behavior within three-component systems is under study. Planned investigations of chloride ternary systems (at ORNL) were preceded by the construction of predicted phase diagrams of the chloride systems of UCls and PuCl4 to facilitate early discovery of optimal compositions for reactor use. The diagrams suggested that the required 35 to 55 at.

The simplest system, which appeared to be capable of providing a range of fluoride melts suitable as blanket fluids and as homogeneous liquids at temperatures above 550 to 600°C, is NaF-KF-ThF4. As the blanket remains in use, the composition could change sufficiently that it effectively necessitates an investigation of the system. NaF-KF-ThF4 showed that the minimum melting eutectic composition is NaF-KF-ThF4 (67-11-22 mole %), melting at 535°C. The contiguous primary phase fields at this invariant point are (NaF. 2ThF4 solid solution, NaF, and NaF+KF+ThF4 solid solution. Substitutional solid solutions are readily formed between NaF-ThF4 and KF-ThF4 solid phases.

It was found that ZrO could be precipitated by adding oxide in the presence of U without detectable UOs precipitation until the ratio [Zr]/[U] in solution fell to about 2. 7 (at 600°C). With further guide additions, both UO2 and ZrO2 were precipitated, with the ratio of [Zr]/[U] remaining nearly constant. This suggested strongly that UOs and ZrO2 were precipitated separately as pure oxides; that is, no (Zr-U)O solid solutions were formed in these systems.

The relation of the separate concentrations of Zr and U in the melt to the estimated oxide ion concentration in the melt was consistent with the simple mass action behavior expected for the above two reactions. This implied that no significant complexing of U or Zr with O2- occurred in the concentration ranges tested earlier.

The recent results were obtained during further exploration of the behavior of UO2 and ZrO2 in equilibrium with Li2BeF4 melts containing UF4 and ZrF4, which were initially directed toward the possibility of oxide solid solution formation. Published phase diagrams are in agreement that a virtually continuous solid solution is formed between UO2 and tetragonal ZrO2 at elevated temperatures (1800°C) and that, although an immiscibility region in the tetragonal solid solution prevails at lower temperatures, tetragonal ZrO2 stabilized by UO2 persists far below the transition of ZrO2 to monoclinic, near 1000°C. Also, in regard to the substitution of U4 for Zr4 in monoclinic ZrO2, these diagrams show, though not with agreement in detail, appreciable regions of solid solution. Such solid solutions have not been manifest in the monoclinic ZrO2 precipitated in the presence of UF4 from MSRE-type melts at operating.

In one of the series of experiments that demonstrated the absence of solid solutions, a weighed quantity of LiBeF (~2.5 kg) melt containing about 1. 3 moles of ZrF4 per kilogram of melt was purified in a nickel container by HF-H2 sparging. Over a period of about 70 days, successive weighed additions of UO2, ZrO2, and UF4 were made. Weighed samples of the melt were withdrawn from time to time with copper filter sticks. Continuous helium sparging was used to provide agitation and to blanket the melt. The results of melt analysis and the estimated solid levels are summarized, wherein the various additions to the melt are labeled A.

Approximately, to that of the MSRE fuel salt, was unchanged over this extended period. In particular, the constancy of the U concentration in the presence of up to 1. 5 moles of ZrOs per kilogram of melt indicated no appreciable take-up of U by ZrOs. At point E, a sample of melt plus solid was taken by means of a dipstick. Microscopic and X-ray examination confirmed the absence of UO₂ in this sample. Along with the finely divided ZrO₂ which had been added, well-formed ZrOs crystals grown from the melt also were found.

At point F, sufficient UF was added to decrease the [Zr4]/[U+] ratio to 2. 2 in the melt. Although based on earlier results, it was expected that UOs precipitation could have intervened under these conditions, the agreement of the analyses with the solid lines in Fig. 3 indicated that no detectable precipitation occurred. The Zr concentration decreased only in accord with the diluting effect of the added UF.

At point G, sufficient UF was added to produce a [Zr+]/[U] ratio of about 1. The subsequent rise in Zr+ concentration and the disappearance of U+ from the melt, shown by the divergence of the dashed lines from the solid lines in Fig. 3, indicated that precipitation of UOs had now occurred by the reverse of reaction (3).

Conformance with this indication was obtained at point H by the addition of a small amount of UOs, which produced no change in the melt composition. At points I and J, still further UOs precipitation was produced by UF additions. After the UF additions at G, I, and J, the [Zr]/[U] ratios solubility ratio of ZrOs to UOs fell with increasing concentration of U and Zr in the melt. Previous results at much lower concentrations of in 4, the effect of temperature on the solubility ratios was small in this concentration range (~1 mole of ZrF2 per kilogram of melt).

At the conclusion of this sequence, the melt was drawn from the nickel vessel through a filter of sintered nickel. The residue on the filter was ground and then washed with water to remove the slightly soluble fluoride salts and the finely divided insoluble material. The residue, examined microscopically, was found to contain principally well-formed, colorless ZrO2 and transparent, red UOs crystals. There was no indication here of (U-Zr)O5 solid solution formation, nor of nucleation of overgrowth of one crystal form on the other.

In a subsequent experiment, the evident variation of the ratio [Zr4]/{U+} as a function of [Zr] when both ZrO and UOs simultaneously saturated the melt was examined further. An LiBeF2 melt, initially free of Zr and U, was purified in the usual way. Additions of UOs and ZrOs followed by UF6 and ZrF4 were made in amounts that were adjusted so that.

Both UOs and ZrOs were expected to be present as solid phases throughout the experiment. The Zr concentration was varied in the range of 0. 007. A mechanical stirrer, which was sealed at the top of the nickel vessel by a Teflon cone seal, provided agitation. In general, equilibration times of several hours to one day were allowed after each addition to the melt or after each temperature change. As a test of the rate of approach to equilibrium, a few samples taken less than 1/2 hr after a composition change were found to be close to the new equilibrium.

The saturation ratios, [Zr]/[Ut], found in these measurements are plotted vs. [ZrT] in 0. 4. Also, the results from the previous series, at [Zr] approximately 1 mole/kg, as well as some earlier data, are included in 0. 4. Although there was an increasing scatter in the data at the lower concentrations of U# and art, there was a consistent trend. The previously reported saturation ratio, [Zr+]/[U4t] = 2.

Below 0. 02 mol of zirconium per kg, the concentration ratio rises sharply with decreasing Zr concentration. The increase is strongly influenced by the temperature. The reason for this variation in the saturation ratio is not known at present.

The saturation limit of U3+ in the presence of increasing oxide ion concentration may fall more rapidly because UO2 is not the saturating phase; for example, a mixed oxide or some new UO2 phase (M, UOy) is formed in which M is Be and/or Li, and y is greater than 2. The possibility of a solid uranium-containing phase in which the activity of UO2 was less than unity gained support from previously reported experiments in which it was found that U3+ could be reduced to very low concentrations in fluoride melts (<4 x 10^-6 mole/kg) by the addition of excess BeO; that is, to concentrations much lower than the estimated U3+ concentration in equilibrium with BeO and UO2 as the saturating solids (~0. 0025 mole/kg).

As the oxide ion concentration in the melt increases, interaction between Zr and O2- to form ZrO2+ or other oxy-complexes could become important. However, as noted previously, this effect should produce significant oxide tolerances in the presence of high Zr concentrations, and none so far has been detected in the concentration ranges involved in MSRE melts.

In future experiments, the effect of excess BeO on the saturation limit in Li2BeF4 will be explored further. In addition, it is planned to vary the oxide ion concentration of Li2BeF4 melts in a known way by means of sparging with a known H2-HF-H2O gas composition. In this way, the variation of [Zr] and [U+] with [O7] can be reexamined to check the possibility of M+-O7 interactions in such melts.

Whatever the explanation, this variation of the saturation ratio ([Zr4+]/[U4+]) with [Zr4+] is an important consideration in the choice of MSRE fuel- and flush-salt compositions. A [Zr]/[U4+] ratio of only 1. Although a flush salt with the composition LiBeF should have a high oxide capacity, at the same time, the saturation limit of U+ is low, and the nature of the controlling mass action behavior is not fully understood. Also noteworthy was the relative ease with which solid UOs reacted and went into solution in these experiments. Whether such nonrefractory behavior would be characteristic of UOs with a different history is uncertain, but that there are at least some conditions under which UOs can be dissolved is of interest in practical operations.

At the conclusion of the second sequence of equilibrations, a sample of the oxides was again obtained by filtration and washing. The photomicrographs in Fig. 5 compare this material with the UOs and ZrOs used in this run as starting materials. The ZrOs, initially <1 µm particle size, was transformed by the equilibration with the fluoride melt to well-developed, colorless monoclinic crystals; some of which were 80 µm long. The UOs was converted from black aggregates of UOs. 15 to well-developed, transparent garnet-red crystals of similar size. The absence of color in the ZrOs suggests that little or no U is present in these crystals.

An X-ray diffraction pattern was made of this mixture using Cu Kα radiation and a 0.25° 2θ/min scanning rate with subsequent fine-tuning for increased precision. Diffraction peaks were produced to approximately 135°. An internal standard of crystalline LiF was used. Within the limits of the method, the lattice constants of the monoclinic ZrO2 and cubic UO2. 009 were not detectably different from the available standards.

It is inferred from these and previous results, which show no evidence of (U-Zr)O2 solid solution formation, that the five published phase diagrams of the ZrO2-UO2 system are considerably in error at temperatures below 1000 to 1100°C. A reinvestigation of the system at lower temperatures, using a suitable fluoride fused salt as an equilibrating medium, would be of considerable interest.

For the present, it appears quite probable that the MSRE fuel will not be subject to uranium deposition as (U-Zr)Os due to oxide contamination. To further confirm this, (U-Zr)Os solid solutions—presently being prepared by UOs-ZrOs reaction at 1750°C—will be equilibrated in LiBeF.

Sulfates are usually present as impurities in molten-salt raw materials. During normal removal by the Ha-HF purification process at the production facility, wherein equipment of copper and nickel is used, there have been instances of severe sulfide corrosion of nickel containers and piping. The study of sulfate behavior in molten fluorides is continuing; therefore, in order to investigate means of reducing the potential corrosion hazards during molten-salt purification and also to assess the possibility of significant sulfide attack on INOR-8 by sulfur impurities which could conceivably remain in the molten salt produced for the MSRE.

Preliminary studies of sulfate removal by the usual HF-H2 purification procedure, as well as sulfate decomposition and solubility, have already been reported. In the present measurements, removal of sulfate from molten LiBeF2 by He, H2, and H2-HF sparging are compared.

Reactions of Sulfate. A large number of reactions are of possible interest in the removal of sulfate ion from molten fluorides, and they lead variously to the formation of SO3, SO2, metal sulfides (by corrosion), S2O2F, and SF compounds.

Since a number of nickel sulfides exist, and often they are nonstoichiometric compounds, the formula NiS is used here and elsewhere in the text to represent whatever nickel sulfide might form. In reactions 7-9 and 13, NiS represents the nickel sulfide with the lowest sulfur content formed at 900 K. Its composition is approximated by the formula Ni₈S₂. The free energies listed in reactions 7, 8, and 13 are based on the PyS/PHS ratios (0. 6) observed by Rosenquist 2%.

Nickel and Copper Corrosion. Penetrating sulfide attack on nickel can occur as a result of a eutectic which is formed between nickel and sulfur (Ni - 33 at. % S), which melts at 645°C. Above this temperature, the liquid formed can apparently penetrate the metal rapidly along the grain.

He finds for solids containing less than 33 at. % S, the equilibrium ratio falls below this curve; no nickel sulfide will be formed, and any that is present will be reduced to the metal. Included in 0. 6 is a curve (calculated from AF for reaction 17) which shows the Py,s/Py ratio required for CuS formation.

From this, it appears that the usual HF-H2S treatment would be most suitable for sulfate removal if the resulting P8/PH ratios do not exceed the levels required for nickel and copper sulfide formation. Severe nickel attack might be avoided by holding the temperature below 645°C, thereby avoiding a liquid eutectic in grain boundaries. The alternative approach is to use a strongly oxidizing gas such as HF or F2 in the hope that SO2 and sulfur oxyfluorides can be driven off rapidly before excessive oxidation of the metal surfaces can occur.

Helium Sparging. Several runs have been made in which small batches (~250 g) of Li2BeF4 were melted and purified by H2O-HF sparging, and then known weights of Li2SO4 were added, and helium sparging was continued over extended periods. Copper-lined nickel containers were used in these experiments. The rate of sulfate removal was followed by periodic sampling of the melt with copper filter sticks, followed by analysis for total.

In a later test, the rate of sulfate removal from the melt was much lower, decreasing to <5 ppm in 5 hr and to <100 ppm in 70 hr. However, in the same run, acidic gases (collected in a KOH scrubber) were given off slowly over a period of many days, showing a decay half-time of about 50 hr. The total amount ultimately collected was equivalent to only about one-third of the sulfate initially present if this gas were SO₂.

These results indicate that the removal of sulfate can occur by several processes, which presumably include copper and nickel sulfide formation as well as SO2 evolution. Even if corrosion could be prevented, the evolution of SO3 appears too slow a process to render inert-gas sparging an attractive removal method.

Hydrogen Reduction. In a subsequent experiment, a purified Li2SBeF4 melt to which Li2S had been added (to 2000 ppm S) was sparged with hydrogen at various flow rates at 600, 700, and 800°C. A nickel container without a copper liner was used. The H2S in the effluent gas was absorbed by ammoniacal CdCl2 scrubbers, which were subsequently analyzed.

The course of this run is shown in Fig. 8. At the beginning of the experiment, the influence of temperature on the removal rate was clearly evident, with the rates being in the approximate ratios 4:7:10 at 600, 700, and 800°C respectively. The increase in removal rate with increasing H2S flow was also evident, particularly during the period from 12 to 20 hr, though the relation is less than a direct proportionality. During this same period (800°C, average H2S flow of 345 cm/min), the sulfur was removed with an approximate half-time of 6 hr. At the end of the run, the container was sectioned lengthwise, and the frozen contents were removed, ground, and sampled. The samples contained 0.0095 mole per kilogram of sulfur, all as sulfide, and 0. Since, with H2S sparging, Ni should not be present to a significant extent in the melt, this nickel was probably present as NiS and NiO solids suspended in the melt. From the material balances for the run (830 mg of sulfur added, 329 mg of sulfur removed as H2S, 149 mg of sulfur found in the frozen melt, 360 mg of sulfur unaccounted for), only 40% of the sulfur added was removed as H2S; the remainder was removed as SO2 or by reaction with the nickel container.

The sectioned container was found to be in good condition. The upper wall of the vessel, which had been exposed to the gas phase, was clean and shiny. Below the surface of the melt, the wall was covered with a light, blackish coating; however, there was no sign of severe penetrating attack. From this, it seems clear that a portion of the 43% of the total sulfur unaccounted for was lost to the walls.

Removal by H2S and HF. Since, even in the presence of hydrogen, some corrosive attack on nickel was evident, yielding nickel sulfides which were not readily reduced by hydrogen, it was decided in the subsequent He-HF sparging experiment to add beryllium metal at the beginning as a means of rapidly reducing sulfate to sulfide. This would prevent the unwanted reduction of sulfate by nickel with resulting nickel corrosion. Once in the form of sulfide, sulfur would present no corrosion hazard under reducing conditions. It would then be removed by HF.

It is clear, however, that these two processes are equivalent to reaction 13 and that, provided the Pyos/PHs ratio is low enough (0. 6), the activity of NiS in the melt will not exceed that required to produce nickel attack. Similar arguments would apply in the case of copper corrosion.

Mole/kg) at 600°C in a nickel container without a copper liner, Li2S0. 4 was added (to 500 ppm, 0. 015 mole/kg). After sparging with helium for 1 hr, a filtered sample was withdrawn and analyzed, giving 390 ppm. A 5% reduction thus was virtually complete, producing a slightly soluble sulfide, presumably BeS or Li2S. At this point, H2S and HF sparging was begun (the course of the run is summarized in Fig. 9). Although it was not possible to resolve the effects of all the variables during the subsequent sparging period, the following observations could be made.

During the initial sparging, the high HF flow rates used for the purpose of oxidizing the unreacted beryllium metal evidently produced excesses of H₂S, which caused some nickel attack. This is indicated by the fact that subsequently, H₂S evolution occurred when only Hp sparging was used. Indeed, the Hp flow seemed to be the most important variable.

The H₂S evolution rate increased with temperature. This is clearly evident at 24 hr, when the temperature was increased from 600 to 700°C. At 68 hr, the increase of temperature to 800°C produced relatively high H₂S evolution rates even though the amount of sulfur remaining was.

Of the 7 millimoles of sulfate added, about 6. 5 were recovered as H2S. A filtered sample of the melt at the end of the run showed 12 ppm S and <5 ppm Se. Nearly all this removal was accomplished in approximately 24 hr, accumulated with H2S flow rates above 60 cm/min.

Although the container has not been examined for evidence of sulfur attack, it is apparent from the good material balance that little corrosion occurred. This may be attributed mainly to the use of beryllium metal reduction of the sulfate. This should allow a more careful study of the separate effects of HS and HF flow rate on the H2S evolution rate.

It was of particular interest that the use of beryllium metal led to nearly complete removal of sulfate without appreciable loss of sulfur to metal corrosion. This could be of value in the fuel production operations, wherein many batches of raw material are processed in a single vessel, and cumulative effects of metal corrosion could possibly be serious. For mixtures in which UF was absent, beryllium metal could be added during the initial meltdown operation, and any excess would remain in the premelting vessel when the molten salt was subsequently transferred to the processing vessel for purification.

The wetting behavior of molten salts on graphite is well understood only for specific systems and usually only if the systems are not complicated by the presence of impurities. For example, MSRE fuels, even with additional fluorides that can occur because of corrosion or fissioning, do not wet graphite in the absence of extraneous impurities. Among the impurities that are known to have a pronounced effect, however, oxygen is outstanding—presumably as combined oxide at the graphite-fuel interface. One of the most sensitive indicators of wetting behavior is the contact angle. In the sense used here, wetting is defined in terms of the contact angle, and 90° marks the transition from wetting to non-wetting.

Experiments with LipBeF at 650°C in nominally pure helium showed an extreme sensitivity of the salt droplet to trace amounts of oxide or moisture at impurity levels so low that accurate measurement became a major problem. The changes in drop behavior were much less drastic and rapid when the amounts of impurities were decreased either by improved purification or by the use of static rather than flowing atmospheres.

For thermodynamic and kinetic reasons, Hs50 is much more reactive toward MSRE melts than Os. In fact, Os reacts with the coolant mainly through intermediary reactions with the container. Less than 10 ppm HsO in a flowing helium atmosphere caused the formation, by hydrolysis, of an oxide scum on drops of LiBeF, and at only slightly higher HsO concentrations, the scum became a shell with sufficient rigidity to prevent further change in droplet shape. Even with 400 ppm Os at 650°C in thoroughly dried helium, changes in contact angle were not detected. No important differences in behavior were noted when moist Hs was substituted for helium; orientation had any detectable effect. Experience in earlier MSRE studies and extrapolation of current results both led to the conclusion that the drops remained unchanged for indefinitely long periods in sufficiently.

In static helium, purified with hot titanium metal sponge, the contact angle, θ, between graphite and either MSRE fuel or coolant was 150°. Error in estimating capillary effects of fuel in graphite, and for many purposes, this is insignificant.

The wetting, such as that shown in Figure 10, when it occurs, takes place on the surface with virtually no permeation of the graphite. The field for the metallographic cross-section illustrated in Figure 11 was chosen to show an exceptional case where the large void near the center of the picture was partially penetrated. Although the failure of the wetting mechanism to continue into graphite pores has not been explained, plugging by oxide and depletion of H2O available from the gas in the pores may play significant roles. In any case, chemisorbed oxygen on the graphite appeared to be of relatively small significance in all the experiments, provided that degassing of the graphite was carried out at 650°C or above. Another point of considerable significance for MSRE operation was that previous saturation of a salt droplet with oxide had little or no effect on the wetting; only when additional oxide was formed on the droplet interface by introduction of moisture did wetting ensue. This is in agreement with a proposed mechanism requiring oxide formation at the three-phase contact for wetting to proceed.

For experiments involving LiBeF2, which was preferred because of its transparency, the precipitated oxide was presumed to be BeO. To confirm that BeO is wetted by LiBeF2, several trials were carried out, with the exception of one, as yet unexplained case; wetting ensued shortly after.

The possibility that protons rather than oxide from H2O served as the surface-active agent was not favored by demonstrations that NH4HF2 and KHF2 did not wet graphite, at least initially. However, KHF2, evolving HF as it melted, developed contact angles of less than 90° in a few minutes.

Over the range 475 to 625°C with a commercial rotational viscometer (Brookfield). The viscometer was calibrated with glycerine-water solutions. Fuel mixture and η = 0. 116 exp (3755/T) for the coolant, where η is the viscosity in centipoises and T is temperature in K.

Structural metal fluorides in molten fluoride fuels or coolants influence the corrosion behavior if present in other than equilibrium amounts, and in large excess, they could conceivably change the pattern of oxide precipitation. Consequently, in the preparation of molten fluoride mixtures for the MSRE and in the subsequent fluoride processing operations, good control of the concentrations of such impurities is important. Accordingly, the rates at which the cations of structural metals can be removed from MSRE-type melts by hydrogen sparging and by using stronger reducing agents, such as beryllium metal and zirconium metal, have been studied. Other objectives of these experiments were to improve fluoride purification techniques and to serve as a guide for fuel processing in the MSRE. Additional studies of the corrosion rates associated with the use of various HF-HP mixtures for oxide removal were planned.

A small amount of Fe° as a tracer had been added. Following dissolution of these materials by hydrofluorination, the rates of removal were determined by analysis of salt samples withdrawn during various conditions of hydrogen sparging. The results shown in 0. 14 indicate the importance of hydrogen flow rate in providing better liquid-gas contact and of the temperature of the melt in which diffusion in the liquid film is probably the controlling process.

Since the reduction rates were controlled by gas-liquid contact conditions that were not well-defined, the small-scale study could not be directly scaled to larger equipment. Accordingly, studies were also made in the large production facility with ~110 kg of the mixture LiF-NaF-ZrF4, weight of iron. Since small-scale experiments demonstrated much faster reduction rates at higher temperatures, the production facility experiments were conducted at a maximum advisable temperature for sustained operations of 700°C. The rates, presented in the form of first-order reaction constants as a function of H2 flow rate in 0. Also, there was little to be gained with flow rates greater than 10 liters/min.

In MSRE melts, an initial iron concentration of 200 to 300 ppm in ~70 kg of LiF-BeFs (66-34 mole %) was used. The melt temperature was again maintained at 700°C. The saving in time at faster flow rates associated with the rate constants shown in 0. 16 demonstrated the.

Reduction of Structural Metals by Beryllium and Zirconium. The use of strong reducing agents such as beryllium or zirconium for removing structural metal impurities from molten salts should, under many circumstances, be more effective than the current technique of hydrogen sparging. However, the use of these elements has frequently led to obscure side effects that must be evaluated before the adoption of strong reducing agents in routine fluoride purification processes, and experiments toward this end have been initiated.

In one experiment, weighed increments of beryllium metal turnings were added to a molten mixture of LiF-BeF2 (66-34 mole %) at 600°C, which initially contained about 800 ppm of iron and approximately 200 ppm of chromium. The analyses of salt samples withdrawn prior to each addition of beryllium are shown in Fig. 17. A reaction period of about 4 hr between additions was assumed to be adequate for complete reaction. The melt was agitated by helium sparging during the entire reaction period. In a similar experiment (Fig. 18), a relatively large concentration (5000 ppm) of chromium was removed from the solution in LiF-BeF2 (66-34 mole %) at 600°C by additions of zirconium metal turnings.

Both of these experiments gave favorable results for the effective removal of structural metal contaminants from molten fluorides, but the apparent stoichiometry of the reacting species was probably complicated by the fact that iron and chromium may be present in both their divalent and trivalent chemical forms. Because of these and other complications related to corrosion and fuel stability, further studies of the effects of elemental beryllium and zirconium are continuing.

In a nickel reaction vessel and treated with anhydrous HF and hydrogen to further ensure melt purity, approximately 25 g of specially prepared zirconium metal turnings were added in weighed increments to the cooled reaction vessel. The zirconium was expected to form ZrF2 by reducing UF4 to UF3. Following each addition, the mixture was heated to 800°C and sparged with dry helium. Filtered samples of the salt were obtained after each reaction period using sintered copper filters and analyzed by a hydrogen-evolution method that does not necessarily distinguish trivalent uranium from other reducing agents, but no others should have been present. At 800°C, approximately 73% of the uranium was found as U3+ by the analytical method, and no significant loss of total uranium was noted. The final zirconium metal additions corresponded to a cumulative 50% excess for the complete conversion of all UF4 to UF3, and hence some metal should have remained. After the final solubility measurements, the liquid at 600°C was decanted from the reaction vessel. The solid material which remained contained UF3 apparently as a primary phase according to petrographic and x-ray diffraction examinations. The uranium content of the obtained after 8 and 20 hr at temperature. Equilibrium temperatures, read with a Pt vs Pt - 10% Rh thermocouple, were approached from both heating and cooling directions.

The heat of solution, calculated from the slope of the line in Fig. , the U concentration apparently remained constant at about 2 wt% over the temperature range studied, and hence the expected equilibrium UF3 += 3UF4 + U°, involving increasing proportions of UF, to UFs at higher temperatures, was not recognizable. Also unexplained were the lack of a more complete reduction in response to the excess of zirconium metal as well as the difference from previously reported results by another technique for a similar composition in which solubilities of UF of 0. 45 mole/kg at 471°C were implied.

Efforts have continued since the last report period on the development and evaluation of methods of analysis of the radioactive MSRE fuel. The mockup hot-cell facility has been used in most of this work in order to simulate the operating conditions necessary to analyze highly radioactive materials. The evaluation of a pyrolysis method for the determination of fluoride has been successfully completed in the mockup facility, and an amperometric method for the titration of chromium is being tested. A modified technique for the determination of oxygen by inert-gas fusion is being investigated.

The pyrolytic determination of fluoride is carried out in an apparatus designed for remote operation. A nickel reaction tube is first heated to 1000°C, and moist oxygen is passed through it at a rate of about 2 liters/min. A test portion, usually 100 mg of the salt, which has been pulverized for ease in sampling and to ensure homogeneity, is placed in a nickel boat and mixed with about 3 g of powdered U3O8, which acts as a catalyst for the evolution of fluoride. The boat is inserted in the heated reaction tube, which is immediately sealed to prevent loss of fluoride. The evolved fluoride is trapped in a known quantity of sodium hydroxide. After 40 min, the absorber solution is removed from the apparatus and the excess sodium hydroxide is titrated with standard hydrochloric acid to a potentiometric endpoint. The fluoride is equivalent to the sodium hydroxide neutralized by the absorbed hydrogen fluoride. In analyses performed remotely on nonradioactive materials, a relative standard deviation of 1%.

An amperometric method for the titration of Cr(VI) with ferrous sulfate has been developed for the determination of chromium in MSRE fuels. A titration cell assembly, which includes a pyrolytic graphite electrode and a standard calomel electrode, was specially designed for this method. The progress of the titration is followed with an ORNL model Q-1160 polarograph with the observed. When the MSRE fuel is dissolved in sulfuric acid, the titration of chromium can be performed without any prior separations. The application of the method is now being tested in the mockup facility with nonradioactive samples. The precision of bench-top analysis is 1%, the ultimate precision that can be expected.

The new ignition chamber was fabricated from a type RF-20 Sylvania radio-frequency lamp, in which the RF energy from an external coupling coil is concentrated to heat a titanium carbide emitter (target) to temperatures as high as 4100°C. The concentrator consists of a water-cooled upper end perforated with a 3/8-inch beveled hole, in which the RF energy is.

In operation, the graphite capsule containing the sample is suspended in the center of the hole in the concentrator from a threaded graphite rod, which also serves to seal the capsule. The position of this capsule is determined by an enlarged spindle that is machined on the top of the support rod to fit the loading tube closely. At the end of the analysis, the ignited sample is removed from the ignition chamber by increasing the gas flow to raise the capsule through the loading tube.

The maximum temperatures obtained with the concentrator have not been measured. However, from observations of color temperature made with the Leco generator operating at fractional power, the new ignition chamber provides better heating than a more elaborate assembly in which the coupling coil is placed within the envelope. Also, because the concentrator partially shields the envelope from the heated capsule, the chamber can be constructed of borosilicate glass rather than quartz, and a large ground glass joint is eliminated.

In initial tests with samples of uranium and zirconium oxides, reduction to the carbides was obtained within a 5-minute ignition period. Thus, temperatures in the order of 2400°C are indicated. Determination of oxygen in MSRE samples, which have been analyzed by the KBrF method, will be performed by comparison.

The statistical evaluation of nickel in MSRE fuel has been completed in the mockup. The dimethylglyoxime spectrophotometric method with potassium persulfate oxidation was employed. A solution of 1 g of MSRE fuel in 100 ml of 0. 5 M H2SO4 was used as the test solution. Into a 50-ml flask was pipetted 4. 5 ml of the test solution containing 39 µg of nickel. The solution was allowed to stand for 30 min, and the absorbance was measured against a blank prepared in the same manner, including the test solution but without the dimethylglyoxime reagent. This sample blank was necessary to cancel the interference due to the uranium color and the slight change in pH caused by the acid content of the test sample. The absorbance was obtained with the remotely operated filter photometer, fitted with a 450-nm filter. Test solutions containing nickel concentrations as low.

The prototype equipment for handling the transport container to remove the sample-filled copper ladle, known as the Transport Container Decoupling Device, has been completed and tested. Upon continued testing, the gearbox of the bear-box-motor section proved weak. Its correction is being studied.

In separating the powdered sample from the crushing container (pulverizer-mixer) and copper ladle, several difficulties were encountered with additional testing in the method previously outlined. To overcome these, two devices were designed: one to hold and align the pulverizer-mixer during assembly prior to pulverizing the sample, and another to effect the transfer of the powder to the polyethylene bottle from which powdered aliquots will be taken for analysis. These new devices are called the Pulverizer-Mixer Aligner and the Powder Transfer Device, respectively. Their prototypes have been tested and modified, and the improved versions are being fabricated.

The pyrolytic apparatus for fluoride determinations has been satisfactorily tested on MSRE fuel in the mockup. It consists of a specially adapted 8-inch tube furnace and nickel combustion tube. The adaptation enables remote insertion and withdrawal of the nickel boat containing the sample and catalyst plus the plugging and unplugging of the combustion tube. The tube furnace is fitted with a Chromel-Alumel thermocouple. The thermocouple output is led outside the mockup cell and connected to a Simply-trol pyrometer control and a variac, thus permitting a temperature control of +10°C at 950°C.

In order to combine into a single apparatus the electrochemical cells needed to perform amperometric, coulometric, and polarographic determinations in the hot cells, a variable electrode cell system was developed. It is approximately 80% complete and is presently being used in the amperometric method for the determination of chromium.

The flowsheet for the MSRE fuel-processing system is shown in Fig. 7. 1. Design of the system was reviewed, and minor changes are being made to the drawings. Changes include provisions for remote replacement of the NaF bed since plugging with chromium is a possibility during fluorination and the addition of an activated-charcoal trap to improve iodine and tellurium removal from the off-gas system. A water analyzer for the section. It is hoped that a commercial hygrometer can be used following an NaF trap for removal of HF.

The possibility of activity released during H2-HF treatment and fluorination of MSRE fuel and flush salt was reported to and reviewed by the Radiochemical Plants Review Committee. The released activity is expected to be well below the limits for air contamination and radiation level at the maximum ground concentration. The permissible releases to prevent excessive ground contamination are lower by a factor of 10 to 10; however, an operation within these lower limits will be verified before reactor criticality.
