The objective of the Molten-Salt Reactor Program is the development of nuclear reactors which use fluid fuels that are solutions of fissile and fertile materials in suitable carrier salts. The program is an outgrowth of the effort begun over 18 years ago in the Aircraft Nuclear Propulsion (ANP) program to make a molten-salt reactor power plant for aircraft.

Our major goal now is to achieve a thermal breeder reactor that will produce power at low cost while simultaneously conserving and extending the nation's fuel resources. Fuel for this type of reactor would be UF6 or 5UF6 dissolved in a salt that is a mixture of LiF and BeF2. The fertile material would be ThF4 dissolved in the same salt or in a separate blanket salt of similar composition. The technology being developed for the breeder is also applicable to an advanced converter.

A major program activity is the operation of the Molten-Salt Reactor Experiment (MSRE). This reactor was built to test the types of fuels and materials that would be used in thermal breeder and converter reactors and to provide experience with the operation and maintenance of a molten-salt reactor. The MSRE operates at 1200°F and at atmospheric pressure and produces about 7.5 MW of heat.

The fuel circulates through a reactor vessel and an external pump and heat exchange system. All this equipment is constructed of Hastelloy N, a nickel-molybdenum-chromium alloy with exceptional resistance to corrosion by molten fluorides and with high strength at high temperature. The reactor core contains an assembly of graphite moderator bars that are in direct contact with the fuel.

Design of the MSRE started early in the summer of 1960, and fabrication of equipment began early in 1962. The essential installations were completed, and prenuclear testing was begun in August of 1964. After additional modifications, maintenance, and sealing of the containment, operation at a power of 1 MW began in January 1966.

At the 1-MW power level, trouble was experienced with plugging of small ports in control valves in the off-gas system by heavy liquid and varnish-like organic materials. These materials are believed to be produced from a very small amount of oil that leaks through a gasketed seal and into the salt in the tank of the fuel circulating pump. The oil vaporizes and accompanies the gaseous fission products and helium cover gas purge into the off-gas system. There, the intense beta radiation from the krypton and xenon polymerizes some of the hydrocarbons, and the products plug small openings. This difficulty was overcome by installing a specially designed filter in the off-gas line.

Full power, about 7.5 MW, was reached in May 1966. The plant was operated until the middle of July for about six weeks at full power when one of the radiator cooling blowers (which were left over from the ANP program) broke from mechanical stress. While new blowers were being procured, an array of graphite and metal surveillance specimens was taken from the core and examined.

Power operation was resumed in October with one blower. Then, in November, the second blower was installed, and full power was attained again. After a shutdown to remove salt that had accidentally gotten into an off-gas line, the MSRE was operated in December and January at full power for 30 days without interruption. The next power run was begun later in January and continued for 102 days until terminated to remove a second set of graphite and metal specimens. An additional operating period of 46 days during the summer was interrupted for maintenance work on the sampler-enricher when the cable drive mechanism jammed.

In September 1967, a run was begun, which continued for six months until terminated on schedule in March 1968. Power operation during this run had to be interrupted once when the reactor was taken to zero power to repair an electrical short.

Completion of this six-month run brings to a close the first phase of MSRE operation, in which the objective was to demonstrate on a small scale the attractive features and technical feasibility of these systems for civilian power reactors. We believe this objective has been achieved and that the MSRE has shown that molten fluoride reactors can be operated at temperatures above 1200°F without corrosive attack on either the metal or graphite parts of the system, that the fuel is completely stable, that reactor equipment can operate satisfactorily at these conditions, that xenon can be removed rapidly from molten salts, and that, when necessary, the radioactive equipment can be repaired or replaced.

The second phase of MSRE operation will involve operating with 735 fuel instead of 35U. A small facility in the MSRE building will be utilized to eliminate the uranium currently in the fuel salt by treating it with gaseous F2. Highly pure 75U will then be introduced to the existing carrier salt, followed by conducting critical, low-power, and full-power tests.

A large part of the Molten-Salt Reactor Program is now being devoted to the requirements of future molten-salt reactors. Conceptual design studies and evaluations are being made of large breeder reactors, and an increasing amount of work on materials, on the chemistry of fuel and coolant salts, and on processing methods is included in the research and development program.

For several years, most of our work on breeder reactors has been aimed specifically at two-fluid systems in which graphite tubes are used to separate uranium-bearing fuel salts from thorium-bearing fertile salts. We think attractive reactors of this type can be developed, but the core designs we have been working on are complex, and several years of experience with a prototype reactor would be required to prove that graphite can serve as a plumbing material while exposed to high fast-neutron irradiations. As a consequence, a one-fluid breeder has been a long-sought goal.

Two developments of the past year have established the feasibility of a one-fluid breeder. The first was the establishment of the chemical steps in a process which uses liquid bismuth to extract protactinium and uranium selectively from a salt that also contains thorium. The second was the recognition that a fertile blanket can be obtained with a salt in which there is uranium as well as thorium by reducing the graphite-to-fuel ratio in the outer part of the core. Our studies show that a one-fluid, two-region breeder can be built that has fuel utilization characteristics comparable to our two-fluid designs, and probably better economics. Since the graphite serves only as a moderator, the one-fluid reactor is more nearly a scale-up of the MSRE.

These features have caused us to change the emphasis of our breeder program from the two-fluid to the one-fluid breeder. Work on both performed during the past six months is described in this report, but most of our design and development effort is now directed to the one-fluid system.

This report period was almost completely occupied with a long run that began in September and was still ongoing at the end of February. When operations were first resumed after the fuel sampler mechanism was replaced, some difficulties were encountered with a radiator door and a component cooling pump. Once the long run was underway, however, the only delay was occasioned by a wiring failure in the sampler-enricher in November.

In the very long run, without the complicating effects of drains and dilutions or fuel additions, an opportunity emerged for a very close comparison of predicted and observed long-term changes in reactivity.

An experiment on the effect of minor variations in fuel temperature, system pressure, and fuel salt level on fission gas stripping extended over a two-month period. There were several different indications that lower temperature, higher pressure, and lower salt level increased the volume of gas circulating with the fuel and delayed the stripping of fission gases into the cover gas.

Two bearings on the main blowers were replaced during a period at low power in January, and the standby component cooling pump was not operable during most of the run. However, neither of these delayed the operation. The wiring failure in the sampler-enricher interrupted high-power operation for nine days, but it was not necessary to drain.

The isolation chamber and drive assembly that were removed from the sampler-enricher were examined and disassembled in a hot cell. After successful decontamination, the major part of the unit was returned for use as a spare. A proximity switch was tested that promises to help prevent cable snarls, such as that which rendered the sampler inoperative. A heated carrier utilizing molten babbitt was built to keep samples hot in transit to the analytical laboratory.

Only a moderate amount of maintenance on the reactor systems was required. Five of the fifteen relays in the rod scram coincidence circuit failed, leading to a decision to replace them with a different type of relay. Water leaks in the nuclear chamber cables continued to give trouble, and two fission chambers and an ionization chamber had to be replaced. A second failure occurred in a position synchro on one of the control rods.

A few minor modifications were made, and some design required for salt processing was completed. Equipment and procedures for analysis of neutron noise spectra were tested and used to obtain data pertinent to reactor operation under various conditions.

Reactor physics studies in support of planned operation of the MSRE with 5% were extended to help evaluate the nuclear safety of the system. As was the case with the present 75U fuel loading, the potentially most severe nuclear excursions were associated with two hypothetical incidents: reactivity addition by the simultaneous withdrawal of the three control rods; and the gradual separation of uranium from the mainstream of circulating salt, followed by its sudden resuspension and rapid return to the core in concentrated form. Both incidents were analyzed with the aid of a digital kinetics program supplemented by analog simulation. In the first incident, we found that rod scram initiated by the action of the safety system would limit the temperature-pressure rises in the nuclear excursion to inconsequential proportions. This same conclusion would apply in the case of the second incident unless the abnormal reactivity loss represented by the uranium separation became larger than about 0. 95% 5k/k. 1%.

Developments in fuel processing and reactor core configurations that enable a one-fluid molten-salt reactor to be an efficient breeder have led us to set aside our work on the design of a two-fluid breeder reactor and to undertake studies of a one-fluid breeder. The fuel for the one-fluid breeder consists of fissile uranium and fertile thorium as tetrafluorides dissolved in a lithium fluoride–beryllium fluoride carrier salt. We have been working on the design of a 2000 MW (electrical) reactor in which the fuel circulates upward around vertical graphite bars in a reactor vessel and then completes the circuit through four pumps and four heat exchangers. As in our designs for two-fluid reactors, the reactor vessel, heat exchangers, and pumps are installed in a heated and shielded cell. Steam generating equipment is installed in cells adjacent to the reactor cell, and sodium fluoroborate salt circulates between the primary heat exchangers and the steam generators to transfer the fission heat to supercritical steam.

Basic piping layouts have been made for the fuel and coolant salt systems. A system has been conceived for cooling the drain tank by thermal convection of sodium fluoroborate salt between coils in the drain tank and air-cooled coils in a natural draft chimney outside the reactor building.

Neutronic calculations of a single-fluid molten salt breeder reactor, with fissile and fertile materials carried in the same salt stream, have shown that breeding performance comparable with that of a two-fluid MSBR can be achieved, provided the power of 2 to 2. 5 MW (thermal) per kg, and annual fuel yields of about 5% per year appear to be attainable with fuel processing rates which probably imply fuel cycle costs less than 0. 5 mill/kWh (electrical).

Such a reactor would have a small negative overall isothermal temperature coefficient of reactivity and a substantially negative prompt coefficient, that is approximately -3x10^(-7) 8K/°C, associated with a change in salt temperature alone.

The analytical model used to compute the steady-state migration of noble gases to the graphite and other sinks in an MSBR was extended to study the effects of graphite surface area and surface coatings on the xenon poison fraction. It was shown that an 8-mil coating of material with a diffusion coefficient of 10^7 ft/hr would reduce the poison fraction from 2% to the target value of 0.5%.

The alterations to and checkout of the test facility for operation with sodium fluoroborate were completed, and a flush charge of 900 lb of sodium fluoroborate was added to the sump. The flush charge is intended to remove residues of the Li-Be.

A preliminary layout was made of a fuel salt pump configuration applicable to the single-fluid molten-salt breeder concept. Preliminary layouts were made of a molten-salt pump test facility and a molten-salt bearing tester suitable for the MSBE salt pumps. Work was initiated on specifications for the MSBE fuel salt pump. Specimens of cermet hard coatings, which are plasma-sprayed on Hastelloy N substrate, were received, and they are being evaluated as candidate materials for molten-salt bearings.

Studies of the problems associated with the maintenance of the MSBR concepts were started. The initial effort is to evaluate the problems caused by scale-up of the general maintenance system used at the MSRE. The three specific areas under active study are: (1) the application of the portable maintenance shield concept to the various cells of the MSBR; (2) remote welding for vessel entry and component replacement; and (3) replacement of the graphite moderator elements of the core on a routine basis. The early development of remotely operated vessel and pipe closures is important to the program, and the study of remote welding as an initial approach is being undertaken.

Analog computer studies of the dynamic behavior of the Molten-Salt Breeder Reactor were begun. A model of the two-fluid system was developed, and several transient cases were investigated to determine uncontrolled core behavior during reactivity changes, fuel salt flow reductions, and simulated load losses. The results obtained lead us to the tentative conclusion that the plant would be inherently load following at the expense of modest temperature changes. They also indicate that it should be quite easy to accommodate rather large load changes using a control system to maintain some desired temperature condition. A model of the steam generator was also developed. The complexity of this model exhausts the capacity of the ORNL analog computer, leaving no equipment available for the simulation of the rest of the plant.

The results continued to show excellent materials compatibility. There was, however, an unexplained difference of about 0. 02 wt% between the chemical analyses for uranium and the uranium concentration computed from operational data. The chromium concentration reached a steady-state value of 85 ppm. This represents an insignificant amount of corrosion, and the view has been advanced that much of the chromium content of the fuel came from the drain tanks.

The fate of fission products in the reactor was established in considerable detail. The only unusual behavior continued to be that of the more noble metals such as Mo, Ru, Te, and Nb. These left the fuel not only by depositing on walls but also apparently as a smoke that was carried away.

A new method of examining the concentration profile of fission products in graphite from the MSRE confirmed the results from the older method. Concentrations of Li and F in the same graphite were obtained by a highly sensitive method involving proton bombardment. Traces of these elements penetrated deeply, but the amounts found, though unexplained, were not chemically significant.

Products were found as those previously encountered in the MSRE pump bowl. This emanation was identified as having the form of aerosols, and pictures of the particles were obtained by electron microscopy. Tests were initiated to explore the nature of colloids in molten salts.

Because of the peculiar behavior of fission products like molybdenum in the MSRE, an exploration of the chemical behavior of molybdenum fluorides and niobium fluorides was continued. Methods of preparing and characterizing MoFy, MoFz, and other compounds were perfected. The rate of autooxidation and reduction of MoFz in LiF-BeF melts was measured.

Electrochemical measurements have revealed the solution thermodynamics of LiF-BeF2 melts over the whole composition range. Experiments on the electrolysis of LiF-BeF2 mixtures with a bismuth cathode were initiated. These were of interest in connection with extractive reprocessing of breeder.

In the past, the lack of vigorous agitation has seriously handicapped work on heterogeneous equilibria in molten fluorides. An improved stirred vessel was therefore designed and constructed. The inleakage of air to this vessel was scarcely detectable. Such a vessel was used in unraveling the chemistry of silica in LiF-BeF2. The use of an overpressure of SiF4 permitted electrochemical cells involving LiF-BeF2 to be constructed.

Laboratory-scale studies of the reductive extraction of protactinium, uranium, and rare earths continued to demonstrate the feasibility of reprocessing two-region molten-salt breeders. As applied to one-fluid breeders, the results were less favorable. The difficulty is that thorium tends to reduce before the rare earths.

Experiments on the reductive extraction of protactinium were carried out in a facility that allowed realistic amounts of alpha-active 701Pa to be followed.

A strong candidate as a secondary coolant was the NaF-KF-BF2 (47-5-48 mole %) mixture, which had a melting point of 350 + 5°C. Experimental phase diagrams for fluoroborates were revised to be consistent with the heats of fusion of NaF and KF. Using a copper block calorimeter, the heat of fusion of the NaBF2-NaF eutectic was found to be 31 cal/g, and the heat of transition was 14.7 cal/g. The heat capacity of the liquid was 0. 36 cal/g.

Molybdenum, tellurium, ruthenium, and niobium are almost entirely separated from the salt. These elements showed no dominant preference for graphite or metal but seemed to deposit on whatever surface was available. Short-lived noble gases appeared to have diffused appreciably into the graphite as shown by the presence of daughter isotopes such as Sr, Ba, and others. However, the major proportions of these, and almost all of the other alkali, alkaline-earth, and rare-earth isotopes (all of which form relatively stable, nonvolatile fluorides) were found in the salt.

Design of a third molten-salt convection loop has been completed. Design features include the use of a modified Hastelloy N containing titanium for improved resistance to radiation-induced high-temperature embrittlement; graphite surveillance specimens in the core section to permit better post-irradiation determination of the interaction of graphite and salt; and gas adsorption traps to help identify the gas-borne fission product species.

Gamma irradiation experiments with sodium fluoroborate salt are being conducted in the central channel of spent HFIR fuel elements to determine the effects, if any, of such irradiations on the sodium fluoroborate and its compatibility with Hastelloy N.

One gamma irradiation experiment and an unirradiated control have been completed to date. Both experiments used an NaF-NaBF2 eutectic mixture (normally 8-92 mole %) in a Hastelloy N capsule containing a Hastelloy N corrosion test specimen. The unirradiated experiment was operated for 840 hours (mostly at 600°C). The gas space in the capsule was maintained at a nominal temperature of 600°C. We were not able to monitor salt temperatures in the lower part of the capsule after thermocouples in this region were lost early in the experiment.

We have removed two sets of surveillance specimens from the core of the MSRE, and one set of metal specimens from outside the core. Metallographic studies did not reveal any evidence of corrosion of the graphite and Hastelloy N by the fluoride salt environment. The Hastelloy specimens from outside the core were exposed to the cell environment and had an oxide film of about 0. 002 in. Testing showed that the mechanical properties of the Hastelloy N changed during exposure, but these changes are equivalent to those noted for materials exposed to equivalent fluences in the ORR. The reduction in the ductility seems to be about saturated for the vessel, and the properties are more than adequate for operation under design.

We continue to obtain samples of several grades of graphite that are potentially applicable for use in molten-salt breeder reactors. Some graphites have been obtained from the Y-12 Plant for which we have detailed information on the raw materials and processing variables. These materials will be included in all phases of our graphite work.

Ability. Carbon coatings have been applied previously in a fluidized bed, and two new methods are under study. One involves passing the carbonaceous gas through the wall of a graphite tube, with the location of deposition being controlled by a radial temperature gradient. A second method utilizes a cyclic technique in which the sample environment is cycled between hydrocarbon mixtures and vacuum. Samples coated by both techniques are being evaluated. Sealing the graphite by the deposition of molybdenum is complicated by the need to minimize the quantity of metal present in the core of the reactor. Our work shows that the graphite can be sealed adequately by about 1 mil of molybdenum if the graphite substrate has a small, uniform pore size of about 1 µ.

We have designed an experimental assembly for irradiating graphite in the HFIR. This facility will allow us to irradiate small graphite cylinders to a fluence of 4x10^20 neutrons cm^-2 year^-1 at 700°C. We have run two short experiments in the HFIR to check the design, have made the necessary changes, and presently have two assemblies in the HFIR. Changes in the specimen dimensions will be measured, and techniques have been developed to measure the velocity of sound in the graphite to determine changes in the elastic modulus.

The radiation damage in Hastelloy N continues to receive considerable attention. Although the strength at elevated temperatures is reduced by irradiation, the reduction in the fracture strain is of primary concern. 5% at a strain rate of 0. 1%/hr. 5% for the standard alloy.

We are continuing the development of the titanium-modified Hastelloy N. We have obtained from commercial vendors about twenty-five 100-lb melts and one 5000-lb melt of the modified composition. The yield of fabricated shapes from the 5000-lb melt was about 50%, a respectable value for standard mill practice. Studies on several small melts show that both carbon and titanium contribute to the strength of the modified alloy in the unirradiated condition.

Determine the titanium and carbon contents to give optimum properties. Diffusion measurements have been made to estimate how rapidly titanium can be removed from the alloy by corrosion. The results indicate that titanium diffuses less rapidly than chromium and should not cause a significant increase in the corrosion rate.

Electron microscopy of standard Hastelloy N has shown that the large precipitates are basically carbides of the M6C type and that they contain several percent silicon. The segregation of silicon to the precipitates probably accounts for incipient.

The residual stresses that develop during welding can cause subsequent cracking of the weldment during service. Measurements on Hastelloy N show that the maximum residual stress is reduced from about 61,000 to 5000 psi by a post-weld anneal of 6 hr.

We have several thermal convection loops in operation to investigate the compatibility of structural metals with various fluoride salts. A loop constructed of type 304L stainless steel and containing a modified fuel salt has operated for 40,510 hr at a peak temperature of 677°C without incident. Removable tabs of stainless steel indicate that the corrosion rate is about 2 mils/year for the first several hundred hours and then decreases, consistent with the behavior expected for a diffusion-controlled process. Analysis of the salt indicates that only the chromium level is increasing. These loops are constructed so that samples can be removed for weighing and salt samples taken during loop operation. Weight changes of the removable specimens indicate a maximum corrosion rate of a few tenths of a mil per year.

A forced-convection loop is in the final stages of construction to investigate the compatibility of Hastelloy N and NaBF4-NaF (92-8 mole %) under realistic service conditions. This loop will have a liquid velocity of 7 fps, a BF4 control system, and capabilities for sampling the salt during operation.

Studies of the oxidation of Hastelloy N indicate that silicon plays a critical role in the scaling resistance. Silicon is usually present in air-melted heats at a level of about 0. 6%, and we would like to reduce this further to improve the weldability. Levels of less than 0.1% silicon can be obtained routinely by vacuum melting. However, the heats with lower silicon have higher scaling rates. Although we have established these trends, the oxidation resistance in all cases is quite acceptable at 760°C.

We have been able to join graphite to Hastelloy N in small sizes (1 in. in diameter) by direct brazing with copper or with an Ni-Pd-Cr alloy. However, the matching of surfaces to obtain good joints in large pipe sizes requires extremely good control over dimensional tolerances; thus, we have not been able to make the direct joint consistently. However, joints can be made repeatedly when a molybdenum transition piece is used between the Hastelloy N and the graphite. A nondestructive testing technique has been developed for determining whether all areas of the joint are bonded. We have investigated the effects of irradiation on several brazing alloys that are potentially suitable for this joint, including Cu, Ni-Pd-Cr, Cu-Ni-Cr-Be, and Cu-Ni-Ta-Be. The strength and ductility changes indicate that all the alloys have acceptable properties after irradiation to fluences of the order of 10^7.

We are setting up the equipment to evaluate several welding processes that are potentially applicable to the remote joining of Hastelloy N. The aim of this study is to choose a welding process that can be further developed for making joints remotely in a high radiation field.

Distribution of uranium, thorium, and rare earths between selected molten fluoride salts and lithium-bismuth solutions is being studied in support of reductive extraction processes for MSR fuels. Data obtained so far show that uranium can easily be preferentially extracted from the fuel salt of a two-fluid or a single-fluid MSBR. Separation of the uranium from rare earths is good (separation factors of at least 10) with each type of fuel. In the processing of single-fluid MSBR fuel, uranium can be separated from thorium by a factor of at least 10. Rare earths can probably be separated from thorium, but more data are required to establish the optimum.

The steady-state performance of a system for isolating protactinium from a single-fluid MSBR by reductive extraction was examined. Calculations based on available tentative equilibrium data indicate that adequate protactinium isolation can be obtained with a system consisting of an extraction column equivalent to about 12 ideal stages, an electrolytic oxidizer-reducer, and a protactinium decay tank having a volume of about 400 ft³. Required salt and metal flow rates are about 2 gpm.

Studies are underway on protecting a continuous fluorinator from corrosion by freezing a layer of salt on the vessel wall. Operability of such a system was demonstrated by countercurrently contacting molten salt and an inert gas in the presence of a frozen layer of salt in a 5-in. -diameter, 8-ft-high column. An internal heat source consisting of Calrod heaters in a 5%-in. -diameter pipe along the center line of the system was used to simulate the volume heat source provided by fission product decay in the molten salt. Frozen wall thicknesses and temperature profiles in the frozen salt were in general agreement with values predicted by relations based on radial heat transfer from a volume heat source.

Relative volatilities for several solutes were measured in the temperature range from 900 to 1050°C using LiF-BeF2 (90-10 mole %) as the solvent. Values obtained with respect to LiF were for CsF and about 2 for ZrF4 (when present in solution at a concentration of 0.083 mole %).

Study of low-pressure distillation of MSRE carrier salt is underway in equipment which includes a 48-liter feed tank, a 12-liter still, a condenser, and a 48-liter condensate receiver. Two runs were made using a still pot temperature of about 100°C and a condenser pressure of 0.06 to 2 mm Hg.

Protactinium removal processes based on reductive extraction using liquid bismuth containing thorium were analyzed to evaluate the feasibility of removing protactinium from the fertile stream of a two-fluid MSBR. Calculations indicate that adequate protactinium removal can be achieved with a system consisting of an extraction column equivalent to about three ideal stages; an electrolytic oxidizer-reducer; a protactinium decay tank having a volume of about 400 ft³; and a fluorinator for the removal of uranium from the decay tank. Required fertile salt and metal flow rates are about 25.

Small-scale tests are being made with simulated MSRE fuel salt to determine the effects of temperature, fluorine concentration, and fluorine flow rate on the rate of uranium volatilization and the rate of corrosion of Hastelloy N. Preliminary results indicate that uranium can be readily removed from the salt with fluorine at 450 to 500°C; however, corrosion rates of up to 0. 5 mil/hr can be expected during the fluorination period.

Fluorination is also being considered for use as the first step in a precise method for analyzing uranium in MSRE fuel salt. The UF6 produced would be collected and decontaminated using the NaF sorption-desorption method. Then, the UF6 NaF complex could be transferred to a low-level radiation area for precision coulometric analysis of the uranium. Decontamination factors for 131Ru, 95Nb, and 125Te have been greater than 10^5; however, attempts to achieve an adequate decontamination factor (greater than 10^3) for iodine have been unsuccessful so far.

Refueling and operating the MSRE with 73° fuel in cell G of the TURF building because of the radiation from the high 7U (222 ppm) content of the 2334. Engineering design and installation of the process equipment in TURF are essentially completed. Additional equipment has been designed and built for drilling holes in the enrichment capsules and for packaging the bulk charge of salt in nine small salt cans. A shakedown run using 3. 8U0 was started January 15, 1968. By the end of February, 90 to 95% of the uranium had been converted to UF6 by treatment with H2-HF. Progress of the reaction has been difficult to follow in the remote facility, and the conversion is slower than expected, probably because of scale-up problems in the production equipment.

Studies of heat generation by gross fission products and 33Pa in a one-region 2000 MW (electrical) MSR show that at equilibrium with continuous processing these components are generating 289.4 and 0.74 MW, respectively, in the fuel stream. When noble gases are sparged from the circulating fuel loop, the fission product decay heat decreases to 257 MW. If, in addition to sparging, the noble metals are removed by reaction with reactor surfaces, the rate is 255. 8 MW. The value above for 233ba decay heat corresponds to a fuel stream concentration of 0.256 g of 5°Pa per liter, the equilibrium quantity when 75°Pa is removed on a 3-day processing cycle. The fission product processing cycle time is 38 days. This processing scheme requires decay storage of 190.5 kg of 5Pa in the processing plant. At equilibrium, this 7°Pa produces 9.7 MW of heat.

Calculations of the heat generation rate at times after reactor shutdown show that as much as 33% less heat is generated in fuel from which both noble gases and noble metals have been removed. The difference between this rate and the gross rate is not always this large, but it does average about 20% lower over the first year.

The six-month period reported here was remarkable for an unprecedented run that began in September and was still going at the end of February, after more than five months. This run, coupled with the very successful operation in the preceding report period, successfully completed the phase of the experimental program whose principal objective was demonstration of reliability in sustained operation.

At the beginning of this report period, the reactor was down because of trouble with the fuel sampler-enricher. The sample latch had been retrieved from the pump bowl, but the drive unit and isolation chamber had not yet been replaced. This job was completed during the first week in September while the salt systems were being preheated for the resumption of operation.

New sampler mechanism. Also, during this time, the coolant salt system was filled, drained for repairs on the radiator door lifting mechanism, and again refilled. The fuel loop was filled with fuel, and full-power operation started on Friday, September 15. During the weekend, an oil leak shut down a component cooling pump.

Plans were to operate the reactor at high power for several months in connection with several studies. These included neutron irradiation of Hastelloy N specimens in the core to higher fluences than this alloy had ever before received, measurement of uranium isotopic changes over a period of substantial burnup to provide information on cross sections, observation of long-term reactor.

Lowered to 10 kW while repairs were made. A containment tent was erected, and a hole was cut in the outer box. This exposed the fault in the cable, so it was not necessary to drain the fuel and go into the inner box. Repairs were made, and tests showed all circuits were operable except one nonessential position switch. Activity behavior as fission products and plutonium built in, and continued studies on fission product distributions.

For the first two months of power operation, the experimental objectives were pursued practically without incident. On October 8 and 9, the power was lowered to 6 MW to permit a low-temperature, low-salt-level experiment on gas ingestion into the circulating fuel. On October 20, the power was down briefly after an area power failure. Three days at 10 kW, October 23 to 26, allowed the 155Xe to clear out of the fuel so that a reference measurement of the reactivity balance could be made. The only equipment problem was an oil leak that shut down a component cooling pump. While the power was down for the sampler repair, an abnormal pressure drop developed in the fuel off-gas line near the pump bowl. The cause was not known, but to minimize the chance of salt mist causing a worse blockage while the pressure was being kept low for the sampler work, the fuel pump was shut off. After two days, repairs permitted the sample to be retrieved, and the isolation valves to be closed. The restriction in the gas line was then blown clear, and nuclear operation was resumed. For about 15 hr after the reactor was returned to full power, indications were that the off-gas restriction was causing some flow to bypass through the overflow tank. Then the pressure drop decreased and was not detectable for the next two hours. Operation continued without interruption on the standby.

From the beginning of run 14, the xenon effect at full power had been about 0.32% 5k/k — about what it was in early power operation but up measurably from the 0.27% 5k/k observed in runs 11 and 12. The reason for this small shift was not apparent, but there had been indications that the xenon stripping was affected to a slight degree by fuel temperature, liquid level in the pump bowl, and system pressure. Therefore, an investigation was started into the effects of minor changes in these variables on the stripping of xenon and other fission gases from the fuel. In order to lower the fuel temperature without bringing the coolant salt below 1000°F at the radiator outlet, the power was first reduced to 5 MW. As can be seen from the experimental operation at various temperatures and pressures extended over the two months from the middle of December to the middle of February.

Beginning on January 22, the reactor power was held at 10 kW for eight days while the temperature and salt level were varied to observe reactivity effects in the absence of xenon. Small changes were observed, reflecting variations in the amount of bubbles circulating with the fuel salt (around 0. 1).

Early in the 10-kW operation, the main blower bearings were inspected, and two were replaced because of damaged balls. The filter in the coolant off-gas line that had been plugged a few weeks earlier was also replaced while the power was down.

After 18 more days of 5-MW operation, which completed the planned experiments on gas stripping, the reactor was returned to full power. Analysis of the data suggested that the system gas stripping may have changed characteristics during the experiments. Therefore, on February 29, the power was again reduced to 5 MW for a recheck of the xenon under conditions outwardly the same as those that had been tested in December.

While reactor operations were proceeding, preparations were being made for the shutdown scheduled to begin late in March. These included preparing the chemical processing system for fluorination of the salt to remove the uranium and designing and building equipment for adding 233 enriching salt to the fuel carrier left after the fluorination.

The continuous operation for over five months in this period afforded an unprecedented opportunity to study long-term changes in reactivity. The reactivity balance under the simplest conditions (low power and no xenon) was checked five times over a period of substantial fuel burnup without any complications of fuel additions or intervening fuel loop drains and flushes. In addition, there was time to vary operating conditions to observe effects on.

Effects of Gas in Fuel Salt. Prior to the current run (run 14), the reactor had operated outside of a relatively narrow range of operating conditions for only brief periods of time. The normal conditions were 1210°F at the reactor outlet, 5 psig helium overpressure at the fuel pump, and a narrow range of fuel salt levels in the pump bowl. Previous deviations from these conditions showed that at least temperature and pressure affected the value of the residual term in the reactivity balance. However, the effects had not been clearly defined.

During run 14, we performed a series of tests in an effort to evaluate the effects of fuel system temperature, overpressure, and fuel pump level on residual reactivity. In these tests, the reactor outlet temperature was varied between 1180 and 1225°F, and the overpressure between 3 and 9 psig. Since the fuel pump level is restricted by the pump's hydraulic performance, only the normal variation in fuel pump level was allowed. This study was performed at a reactor power of 5 MW to provide the required latitude for the temperature.

Small but significant variations in reactivity were observed. The major part of the variations was caused by changes in the 135Xe poisoning in the reactor, apparently induced by variations in the effectiveness of gas stripping caused by the parameter changes. Table 1. 2 presents a summary of the net observed 135Xe poisoning terms at the various conditions. In general, the xenon poisoning increases with decreasing temperature and increasing overpressure. However, the pressure effect practically disappears at the higher temperatures. Conversely, the temperature effect is smaller at the lower pressures. The effect of fuel pump level is much less pronounced than the temperature and pressure effects, but decreasing level leads to higher xenon poisoning for the range of levels investigated.

The details of the changes in 5Xe poison were obtained from the reactivity balance. In addition, several samples of the fuel off-gas were obtained under various operating conditions so that the 136ye/134ye ratio might be measured to verify that the apparent xenon poisoning was, in fact, due.

Aside from the variations in xenon poisoning, there was other independent evidence which clearly indicated changes in the effectiveness of removal of gaseous fission products to the reactor off-gas system. Poorer removal of the gases coincided with the higher poison levels. The temperatures of the off-gas holdup volume in the reactor cell (L-522) and the particle trap are sensitive indicators of the fission product concentration in the off-gas stream.

Another effect observed during these tests was a significant variation in the amount of undissolved gas in circulation with the fuel salt. These changes were measured by the small reactivity effects at zero power with no Xe in the system. Additional qualitative support for variations in void fraction was obtained during power operation from spectral measurements of the inherent neutron-flux noise and from temperature observations at the 3.3. The reactivity balance gave a reactivity loss of 0.032% k/k between the condition with the fewest circulating voids (1225°F and 3 psig overpressure) and that with the most (1180°F and 9 psig). This implies a change of 0.15 to 0.2% by volume in the void fraction between these two conditions. No change in void fraction with fuel pump level was detected, and there was no observable pressure effect at 1225°F. However, at 1180°F, over half of the total change between the two extremes was due to the pressure difference. Column 7 of Table 1.2 shows the approximate magnitude of the additional circulating void fraction at each condition.

The tests in this run indicated at least the qualitative nature of the effects of system temperature and pressure on xenon poisoning and circulating voids. However, they also demonstrated that the effects are not necessarily completely reproducible.

For the first four months of run 14, the characteristic value for this term was 0. 33% OK/k. After the period of low-power operation in January 1968, the xenon term reverted to the old value. Since this change occurred in the middle of the 5-MW tests to define xenon behavior, no explicit quantitative evaluation can be made. This is illustrated by two nominally identical tests made under conditions of high xenon poisoning before and after this change. Tests on December 23 to 25, 1967, and March 3 to 6, 1968, both involved operation at 5 MW and 1180°F with 5 psig overpressure. The respective Long-Term Changes.

Drift in residual reactivity is obtained at very low power with no xenon present. In earlier operations, these data were taken only near the beginning and the end of the various reactor runs, and many runs were relatively short in terms of fuel burnup and net control rod movement. Comparison of data between runs was further complicated by the need to compensate for the dilution effects of fuel drains and flushing operations. All these results were scattered within a relatively narrow band of reactivity values with no particular trend in evidence. During the six months of run 14, zero-power reactivity data were collected on five separate occasions. The average reactivity slope during run 14 was -3.5 x 10^7 °(% δk/k)/Mwhr. Reexamination of earlier data showed considerable scatter around this value but no real inconsistency with it. Some of this scatter occurred because significant scatter was encountered between individual reactivity balances at some data points taken within a particular reactor run, that is, after a reactor fill and before the subsequent drain, are connected by straight lines. Where lines are drawn from two points at a given condition, the points represent the extremes of significant reactivity balance variations at that condition.

If the negative reactivity slope observed in run 14 were applied to the entire power history, a total negative deviation of 0. 22% Δk/k from the beginning of operation would be expected. The fact that a total change of this magnitude has not been observed suggests the presence of errors that tend to compensate for the negative drift observed during operation. A possible source of such an error is the corrections that must be applied for the dilution effects of reactor drains and flushes between.

A reactor flush results in a net transfer of uranium (and other fuel constituents) from the fuel salt to the flush salt. If the amount of uranium transferred in such a flush is overestimated in the correction that is applied to the reactivity balance, the residual reactivity is shifted in the positive direction, opposite to the direction of drift during operation. An overcorrection of 2.6 kg in total uranium would be required to compensate for a drift of -0.22% Sk/k. To date, total uranium corrections in the amount of 4.9 kg have been applied to the reactivity balance analyses of the flush salt when it was last in the fuel loop, indicating a total uranium content of 5.0 kg. In applying the calculated corrections, it is assumed that the total volumes of fuel salt and flush salt remain constant. A gain of 0.7 ft in the actual flush salt inventory at the expense of the fuel salt could also conceal the expected negative reactivity drift. Thus, it does not appear that errors in corrections between reactor runs are compensating for the downward drift during the runs. The source of the compensating effect has not yet been identified.

There are a number of possible causes for the negative reactivity drift during any one run. However, none of these appears to be large enough to explain the drift. For example, if the drift were due to an error in power calibration, an error of about 30% would be required. The data on the 10%. This is further supported by the rate of 239py buildup in the fuel and various fission product studies. Another possible source of error is nonuniform deposition of fission products in the fuel loop. Therefore, the small negative trend in reactivity remains unexplained at the present time. It is worth noting, however, that the magnitude is well within the allowable reactivity anomaly of 0. 5% 5k/k. This limit is based on reactor safety studies that placed conservative interpretations on reactivity losses and their possible consequences.

The reactor access nozzle is one of the two places in the fuel loop where there is a gas-liquid interface; the other is the fuel pump bowl. Variations in the liquid level in the access nozzle, which can be inferred from thermocouple readings, afford some information on the gas circulating within.

As shown in Fig. 3, the reactor access nozzle (RAN) is a 10-inch pipe with a cooling-air jacket on the outside. Inside is an air-cooled plug attached to the closure flange. In the large plug is a smaller nozzle and an air-cooled plug, providing access to the sample assembly in the core. It was intended that frozen salt plugs be established in the annuli between the cooled plugs and nozzles to prevent molten salt from coming in contact with the metal ring seals at the access flanges.

Two mechanisms transport gas to and from the RAN annuli. Owing to the higher static pressure at the RAN, helium is transferred from the RAN to the pump bowl gas space as a solute. This effect was previously noted on the Engineering Test Loop in the operation of the forerunner of the reactor access nozzle. The mechanism which delivers gas to the RAN is the collection of circulating bubbles from the fuel passing by the lower ends of the annuli. The equilibrium condition between these two mechanisms determines the gas inventories and the liquid levels in the RAN annuli. Changes in the liquid levels can be detected by monitoring the thermocouples attached to the RAN.

Pressure and the reactor outlet salt temperature for a period of ten days in February. The test in progress at that time was one to determine the effects of pressure and temperature on reactivity while operating at 5 MW power. On February 10 and 11, the reactor outlet was increased to 1225°F, while the fuel pump pressure was maintained at 3 psig. At the beginning condition, that is, high system pressure and low salt temperature, the molten salt levels in the annuli are below the levels of the two thermocouples. When the pressure was lowered on February 6, RAN temperatures dropped initially, indicating the lowering of the salt level due to the expansion of gas trapped in the RAN annuli. Very soon, however, the molten salt rose to or above the R43B thermocouple location. Thus, it would appear that bubbles were bringing gas into the annuli at a lower rate. After the second temperature increase, the level apparently rose over a period of about two days until it was near thermocouple R7B. Thus, the increase in circulating fuel temperature also appeared to reduce the amount of bubbles bringing gas to the annuli.

The temperature differences between the reactor inlet and the lower head, and between the inlet and the core support flange, continue to be the indicator for possible sedimentation buildup within the reactor vessel. These temperature differences agree satisfactorily with previous data and indicate that there has been no significant solids accumulation within the reactor vessel. Table 1. 3 shows a comparison of the data collected during run 14 with those collected and reported previously.

The temperature distribution on the upper surface of the fuel pump tank during run 14 was about the same as that in run 12. As reported previously, the temperatures are somewhat lower than in earlier power runs, and the reason for the difference has not been established.

Damage is shown in Table 1. 4. Approximately 69% of the design thermal cycle life of the fuel system freeze flanges has been used to date. This compares with a value of 63% of the design life that had been consumed at the end of the previous report period. Essentially no thermal cycle damage has been accumulated on the fuel system flanges since the fuel system was last filled on September 20, 1967, at the beginning of run 14.

The preponderant term in this balance is the heat removed from the system by the secondary (coolant) salt. Its accuracy is therefore strongly dependent on the accuracy with which that term is evaluated. Other indications of reactor power — radiator air heat balances, fission product inventories, and nuclear instrument readings — have provided only reasonable (20%) confirmation of the heat-balance power calibration. Since all these techniques could involve substantial systematic errors, an effort has been made to check the power calibration by an independent technique.

A potentially accurate standard as a monitor for integrated power in a nuclear reactor is the change in the isotopic composition of the uranium fuel. The accuracy of this method depends on the existence of an isotope whose concentration changes.

Significantly, and in a manner that can be accurately related to energy production, the 56U in the MSRE fuel is well-suited to this purpose. The fraction of 56Y in the uranium mixture has increased by a factor of 3 in the course of power operation with the 75U fuel. Since 75U is produced only by parasitic neutron captures in 75U and since the rate of burnup of 70U is very low, the net production of this isotope per fission event depends primarily on the value of a (= 0/G) for 235y in the MSRE neutron spectrum. Extension of this relationship to total energy production depends only on the effective energy yield per fission in this reactor.

The absolute rate of production of 36U in the MSRE was inferred from several fuel samples in which the uranium isotopic composition was measured. These data were combined with "book inventories for total uranium and corrected for various reactor reactions (drains, flushes, and fuel additions) to obtain loop inventories for 7°U. Since chemical results for total uranium have consistently been within 1% of the book values and the precision of the isotopic assays is high, the accuracy of the 7U inventory is probably within +5%."

The heat balance measurements. The solid line is a least-squares fit to the data points and has an effective 5U neutron cross-sections and fission energy yield in the MSRE of 0. 0109 g/Mwhr, which is within 1% of the observed slope. The uncertainty in the theoretical slope is probably less than 10%, so the actual integrated power is probably within 10% of the value indicated by the heat balances.

The 1200-gpm pump that circulates fuel salt and the 850-gpm pump that circulates coolant salt continued to run uneventfully. By the end of the report period, the fuel pump had run for 18,400 hr, 14,415 hr circulating salt, and 3985 hr circulating helium. The coolant pump had pumped salt for 16,229 hr and helium for 3082 hr for a total of. There is probably some oil leakage into the pump bowls, but the rates must be very small since they do not produce significant changes in the oil inventories. The replacement rotary elements for both pumps are seal-welded to prevent such inleakage, but the oil problem is so minor that replacement is.

The heat transfer performance of the fuel-to-coolant-salt heat exchanger continues to be monitored by periodic evaluations of the heat transfer coefficient and by the heat transfer index.

The heat transfer index was 605 Btu/hr·ft(°F)^-4, compared with 586 Btu/hr·ft(°F)^-1, which is the average of the six previous measurements. 0376 Mw/°F, which is also slightly higher than the previous data. The apparent increase in heat transfer was caused entirely by a recalibration of one of the coolant salt flow elements, which increased the indicated coolant salt flow rate and the calculated heat removal rate at the radiator. This increased the calculated heat balance power by about 100 to 200 kW at full power. Thus, the conclusion is that the heat transfer performance of the heat exchanger has remained unchanged since the beginning of operation.

During this six-month report period, operation of the sampler-enricher was resumed with a new isolation chamber and cable drive assembly. Except for the wiring failure that occurred in November, only minor difficulties were encountered. A total of 70 sampling operations were made during the report.

Three of the 10-g samples were of flux salt; the others were of fuel salt. The 50-g samples were taken for uranium isotopic analyses, determination of oxide level or U/U4 ratio, and other special analyses, as reported in Part 3 of this report. All the sampling attempts were successful, except that one 50-g capsule collected only 5 g of fuel salt. The attempt appeared normal in every other respect, and the explanation for the small amount of salt is not known. Operations during the period brought the total use of the sampler-enricher to 114 uranium enrichments and 349 samples and special exposures.

Valve buffer system has been sensitive to heat from the illuminator, drifting by 25% of full scale when the light is turned on. A reflective metal shield was placed over the thermal insulation around the transducer. This helped, but it did not eliminate.

The wiring fault appeared in the following manner. On November 14, as a sample was being withdrawn from the pump bowl, the 0. 3-amp fuse in the drive motor circuit blew. Subsequent tests showed that the insert mode drew the normal 0. 2 amp, but since the locked-rotor current is only 0. 3 amp, the high current indicated leakage. During further tests, three circuits opened, disabling the motor insert and withdraw circuits and the upper.

The most likely location for the failure was believed to be at or between the outer and inner containment penetrations. This area was suspected because of its small clearances and tight bends in the cable. High-frequency capacitance measurements with a Grid-Dip meter indicated that the length of cable to the point of failure was consistent with this guess. Therefore, after a nonflammable plastic tent was erected over the sampler-enricher to prevent the spread of possible contamination, a 3-in. -diameter hole was sawed in the cover plate directly above the cable penetration into the inner box (1-c area). The failure was found where the wires were bent back down against the side of the plug on the lower end of the cable between the inner and outer boxes. A temporary connection showed that everything inside the inner box was operable. The sample capsule was retrieved, and the isolation valves were closed at this time. The damaged section of the cable was abandoned, and a new cable was installed having a penetration through a 4in. pipe cap welded over the sawed hole in the top cover.

While the cap was being welded in place, a heavy current evidently went to ground through another cable that penetrated the top cover near the new cap. The receptacle and plug were destroyed. Repairs were made by cutting out and replacing this penetration. As a result of this experience, an isolation transformer and a fuse were added to each. This allows one ground without interference with.

After the repairs, all circuits were operable except the upper limit switch. This switch normally stopped the drive motor when the latch reached the latch stop. Because the motor and circuit can withstand blocked-rotor current, the upper limit switch was bypassed, and the motor is now turned off manually when the position indicator shows the latch is fully withdrawn.

Containment has been quite good. A minor release of activity to the stack occurred at least once while area 3A was being evacuated. After all disconnects in the sampler off-gas system were checked and tightened, no further detectable release occurred.

The control rods continued to operate freely throughout the report period. Tests in September and late January showed no shift in position reading and no appreciable change in rod drop times. The only mechanical difficulty was with the fine-position synchro transmitter on drive No. 2, which developed an open circuit in January. This synchro was one that was installed in May 1967, so its service life was relatively short for some reason as yet unknown.

During the flush salt operation in September, at the beginning of run 13, the outlet door tended to jam because it was hanging crooked. The trouble appeared to be in one of the housings for the springs through which the cables lift the door. A piece of some material, apparently weld slag, had fallen in and jammed the piston in that housing, preventing it from moving up. The piston in the other housing was free. Both coil springs were found to have become permanently compressed, probably because of subjection to high temperatures in the startup period before hoods were installed over the doors. Since the springs were not.

Fuel Off-Gas System. A restriction became evident in the off-gas line somewhere between the pump bowl and the junction of the overflow tank vent with the 4-in. holdup line. The first indication appeared after 2 days of operation at 10 kW following the sampler-enricher wiring failure of November 14. During this period, the operational and maintenance valves were open, and a 0.6-liter/min helium purge was maintained down the sampler tube to the pump bowl to prevent contamination of the sampler by fission gases. The restriction was evidenced by an increase (0.0 psig and suddenly venting the gas into a drain tank which was at 3 psig. The pressure drop then appeared normal (<0.1 psi), but after three more days of low-power operation, an abnormal pressure rise (0.2 psi) was again observed when salt was being returned from the overflow tank. Repetition of the mild blow-through to the drain tank had little or no effect this time. The line was not completely blocked, however, and full-power operation was resumed.

At first, temperatures on the overflow tank and the off-gas line (responding to fission product heating) clearly indicated that there was enough pressure drop at the pump bowl outlet to cause much of the off-gas to bubble through the overflow tank and out its vent line. Then, after 15 hr at full power, the bypass flow stopped, indicating that the pressure drop through the restriction had decreased.

The pressure drop remained below the limits of detection throughout the next nine weeks while the reactor was operating at 7. 2 MW or 5 MW. Then, after two days at 10 kW, the pressure again became detectable and continued to increase over the next six days at very low power. When power operation was resumed at 5 MW, temperatures indicated that there was again bypass flow through the overflow tank. The restriction increased during two weeks of operation at 5 MW, but the line never became completely plugged. Then, while the overflow tank was being emptied, four days after the resumption of full-power operation, the restriction partially blew out, bringing the pressure drop again below the limit of detection.

The behavior was quite unlike the plugging that occurred earlier in the same section of the line as a result of the overfill with flush salt, mainly in that it never completely plugged, and there was a suggestion of some effect of power level. Plans were made to investigate this restriction in the offgas line at the next shutdown. Tools were prepared, like those used earlier, to clear out the off-gas line at the pump bowl. Preparations were made to remove the short flanged section of the off-gas line for examination and replacement with a line instrumented with thermocouples.

Main Charcoal Beds. The performance of the charcoal beds was very good; none of the annoying plugging problems experienced previously appeared during this reporting period. During run 13 and the early part of run 14, with sections 1A and 1B in service, the maximum pressure drop across the beds in parallel was 3.0 psi.

The main charcoal beds were conservatively designed to delay the krypton and xenon long enough (7 days for Kr, 90 days for Xe) so that the major radioactive constituent in the effluent gas would be 10-year Kr. The beds were designed to provide these holdup times when the off-gas flow was equally divided between two sections in parallel; however, there were some indications during early operation that adequate holdup might be provided with all the flow through only one section.

The section was started with only section 1A online. Only a very moderate rise in effluent activity materialized. Section 1A remained in service alone for the remainder of the run, with the exception of a ten-day reactivity test at low fuel pump pressure when two beds were in service to permit lower.

Pressure control valve: This filter has plugged regularly and has been replaced seven times over the three years since the start of preoperational checkout of the system. The plugging appears to be due to liquefaction of oil vapors from the coolant pump in the pores of the sintered metal. The filter plugged again during this report period, and the coolant pump pressure was controlled by venting through a line bypassing the plugged filter.

The two main blowers, MB-1 and MB-3, continued. The main bearings on both blowers had to be replaced in January, but it happened that there was no interference with reactor operation. The reactor was being operated at 5 MW on one blower, MB-3; noise in the bearing, MB-1, was brought online, and MB-3 shut down. A week later, the reactor power was lowered to 10 kW as part of the reactivity experiments. So, for several days, neither blower was needed. Although the vibration meter on MB-1 bearings had shown no trouble during operation, there was some periodic noise and roughness that could be detected during a coastdown. Therefore, while the power was down, the thrust bearing on each blower was replaced.

The MB-1 bearing was the one supplied with the rebuilt blower in the fall of 1966 and had been seen to be adequate. The relatively short service life could not be attributed to improper lubrication, which was the suspected cause in an earlier bearing failure. Analysis of the bearing loading and stresses revealed that according to accepted design correlations, the expected service life was only 5000 hr, about what was actually attained. The original bearings were radial-type ball bearings in which thrust load produced high stresses.

Fuel drain line within the reactor vessel furnace, between the freeze valve and the resistance-heated section of the line. The purpose of the heater was to help control the temperature profile through the freeze valve. After the heater failed, tests with flush salt showed that by proper adjustment of the cooling air controls, the freeze valve could be maintained reliably with thaw times in an acceptable range. Therefore, this heater was not replaced.

The last of the six heating elements in heater HX-1 on the primary heat exchanger failed during the previous semiannual report period. In December, a lead to the adjacent heater, HX-2, opened, thereby reducing the output of this heater by 50%. A week later, a second partial failure further reduced the output to only 33% of normal. Although these failures do not affect operations so long as salt is kept circulating, the lack of heat in the two adjacent heaters will make it necessary to repair or replace them during the next shutdown.

Power lines, a preferred line or an alternate. Originally, the two main blowers could not be operated while the area was on the alternate feeder; but rearrangement of feeders at the ORNL substation reduced the load on the alternate supply to the MSRE. During this report period, the reactor was operated for the first time at full power while on the alternate feeder. The occasion was a manual switchover for 2 hr, while a defective insulator was replaced at the substation.

A building power failure occurred on a foggy morning in October when an arc developed between a 13.8-kV line to the main transformer for the building and a parallel metal activator rod to the 13.8-kV line fuse. The cause of the arc is unexplained. Although the weather was foggy, it was not unusually wet. This fault caused the operation of the preferred feeder overcurrent ground relay located at the ORNL substation, which tripped the feeder breaker before the line overcurrent relay located at the MSRE could operate to prevent an automatic transfer to the alternate feeder. When the MSRE was transferred, the alternate feeder overcurrent ground relay operated, and the alternate feeder breaker also tripped. ) After an interruption of 37 minutes, low-power nuclear operation was resumed on emergency electrical power from the diesel generators.

The three diesel generators at the MSRE have proven to be quite reliable. They are started and operated unloaded for about an hour each week. Once a month, they are tested under load. They have never failed to start when required during a power outage. Under emergency conditions, they are usually running within 2 minutes after a failure of the normal power supply.

Side of the cooling coils on the oil reservoirs. By December, the temperature of the oil supplied to the pumps was up to 150°F, so the water supply was changed from tower water to cooler process water. During about two months on process water, the heat transfer improved to the point that tower water again gave acceptable cooling.

Accumulation of shaft seal oil leakage from the fuel pump was steady at about 12 cm3/day from September through November. For the next two months, there was no measurable accumulation in the oil collection tank. Then, about February 10, leakage began to collect again and averaged 6 cm3/day for the remainder of the month. Oil accumulation from the coolant pump shaft seal leakage also varied. In September and October, it was only 7 cm3/day. The rate increased in November to 15 cm3/day, and in the last three months was relatively steady at about 20 cm3/day. These accumulation rates are in the range observed in earlier operation of the salt pumps.

During power operation, samples were taken at weekly intervals, and they showed no significant deterioration of the oil quality. To compensate for these samples and shaft seal leakage, 2.8 gallons of oil were added to the fuel pump lubrication system and 2.0 gallons to the coolant pump system. Inventories based on additions, sample removals, and accumulation of seal leakage showed, during this six-month report period, a net apparent gain in the coolant oil system of 114 cm³ and a net apparent loss from the fuel oil system of 545 cm³. Because of inaccuracy in the inventories and a slight systematic error as unmeasured losses in sampling the fuel pump oil, the probable error in net change is about 1200 cm³. Thus, the apparent changes are well within the probable error.

Operation of the cooling water systems continued satisfactorily throughout the report period. The only disturbance of normal operation occurred when a 6-inch cast-iron pipe supplying water for the building fire protection system and the potable water system cracked underground just outside the building. Adequate cooling was maintained.

Maintained while the break was being repaired by shifting some items from process water to tower water and running a temporary hose connection from the water main to the process water system. A dry fire hose was laid from the nearby Nuclear Safety Pilot Plant for possible emergency use.

Although leak tests in June 1967 detected no leakage from treated-water components in the reactor cell, a small leak apparently persists. Throughout this six-month period, condensate collection in the component cooling system averaged about 0. 73 gpd. Measured losses from the treated water lost by evaporation from the degassing tank that strips radiolytic hydrogen and oxygen from the treated water.

During a short period in December, the treated water loss increased to about 4 gpd. The increase was traced to a leak across a pressure-relief valve, which discharges to the waste system to prevent excessive pressure buildup in the event the radiation block valves close. The leaking valve was.

Oil leaks in the lubrication systems of the main component cooling pumps were troublesome during this period. In run 13, after six days of flush salt circulation and two days of nuclear operation, CCP-2 was shut down by low oil pressure. Repairs consisted of capping a leaking drain line and tightening several packing nuts and fittings. The other blower, CCP-1, was used for the first 873 hours of run 14. The standby unit, CCP-2, was immediately started up and operated without further difficulties throughout the remainder of the period, 3036 hours.

The strainer in the discharge of the component cooling pumps developed an excessive pressure drop during run 13, and the screen was replaced at the time of the repairs to CCP-2. The strainer basket that was removed had been installed before.

In 1800 hours of operation, its 100-mesh screen had become partially plugged with rubber dust from the drive belts. The screen was damaged in removal, and a replacement basket was made, which showed no pressure buildup over the five months.

Cooling air for the coolant salt freeze valves was supplied most of the time by the service air compressor. AC-3, Component cooling pump 3 was kept in standby and used only when AC-3 was undergoing programmed maintenance. Once, while CCP-3 was in service, a bearing seized, requiring replacement of the bearing and drive belt. The blower had been operated for a total of only about 200 hours since a similar bearing failure.

Oxygen analyzer readings can, in principle, be used with other data to compute air inleakage. However, the assumption of no oxygen consumption in the cell led to a calculated negative inleakage of air. Results showed an apparent consumption of 3 to 4 scfd of oxygen, presumably by reaction with some substance in the cells.

Moisture condensed in the component cooling system, which is an extension of the reactor cell, is drained once a day. Collection rates averaged 0. 73 gpd over the five months of run 14 in this report period. Daily amounts ranged from practically none to several gallons when the temperature outdoors (and in the special equipment room) was.

The system is maintained by one of two stack fans. Stack fan No. 1 is usually kept in service, with No. 2 on standby. After almost continuous service since lubrication system modifications in March 1966, fan No. 1 developed roughness in a bearing, and the bearing was replaced in February 1968.

During maintenance work in September 1967, the pressure drop across the roughing filters at the ventilation stack increased to the point that stack flow was significantly reduced. The filters in two of the three parallel banks were replaced, and dust filters were installed on inlets to ducts in all accessible areas to retard buildup on the roughing filters.

The system developed for sampling and limited on-line analysis of the fuel off-gas has been described in previous progress reports. During this report period, the installation of the off-gas sampler was completed, and the system was given a preoperational check, including leak tests, pressure tests, and test operation of the instruments. Operational use then began with the removal of several samples for off-site analysis of xenon isotopic composition.

Prior to the removal of reactor gas samples, three samples of a standard gas containing krypton, xenon, and carbon tetrafluoride were trapped with the refrigerated molecular sieve adsorber. The adsorbed gases were swept into removable sample bombs, whose contents were then analyzed to determine the fraction of the sample passed through the bed that was recovered. The fractions recovered were calculated to be 67%, 76%, and 86% for the three samples. (The fraction recovered was practically the same for Kr, Xe, and CF4).

The molecular sieve and removal bombs were used to remove four samples of reactor gas that had been isolated for three to seven weeks in the permanent isolation chambers in the off-gas system. The first sample contained about 50% air, possibly because of incomplete purging of the system piping before the sample was removed.

No air was detected in subsequent samples. Xenon isotopic ratios were measured, but the concentration of xenon was too low to obtain the desired accuracy. Therefore, after the third sample, the procedure was changed to obtain a higher concentration of gases in the bomb.

One sample was trapped directly from the reactor off-gas stream while the reactor was operating at full power. When the sample was first transferred to the removal bomb, the radiation level in the containment box was over 100 r/hr, but the radioactivity decayed rapidly, and the sample was successfully removed after four days.

Several equipment problems were encountered, but all could be remedied. During preliminary testing, half of the elements on one of the thermal conductivity cells burned out for some undetermined cause. A new cell was procured and installed, and no further trouble occurred. Just before the first off-gas sample was removed from the isolation chamber, one of the two pressure transducers failed. By modifying the procedure, it was possible to operate without the failed element. It was replaced, however, when the containment box was opened for another reason. The box had to be opened because of considerable difficulties with the valve extension handles. When the extension handles were first being installed, several of the operating fingers broke off easily at welds. It turned out that a piece of Inconel had accidentally been used instead of stainless steel in making the handles, and the welds were brittle. All the handles were rewelded using proper welding procedures. The extension was then damaged when an attempt was made to operate the valve. A slight modification was made to improve the top.

The tangling of the drive cable that led to the reactor shutdown in August apparently started with the capsule or latch jamming at the lower isolation valve (the maintenance valve). Then, since the jam was undetected, the drive cable was forced off the reel into the isolation chamber above the valves, causing it to tangle and kink. The new drive unit that was installed in September has a latch of magnetic material and during this report period, a device was developed to sense the passage of the latch past a point in the tube.

The device is a commercially available unit that actuates a switch when a magnetic object moves into and out of its field. The device was tested and proved capable of sensing the latch inside the sampler tube. The available unit is not resistant to radiation damage and is therefore not suitable for mounting inside the reactor cell. A design was prepared to mount the switch about 10 in. below the maintenance valve to indicate when the latch has passed through both valves in the line.

Some additional information on one aspect of the sampler trouble in August was uncovered when the inoperative drive assembly and isolation chamber (1-C assembly) were disassembled in a hot cell. When the cover was removed in the hot cell, it was not possible to obtain a clear view of the drive unit. However, when the unit was removed from the box, it was evident that the Teleflex drive cable was not tangled in the gears as had been supposed. In fact, there was little or no slack in the cable between the reel cover and the hole in the latch positioner through which the cable passed to the isolation chamber below. The probable reason that the cable could not be driven up or down was found to be a sharp kink in the drive.

Cable. This kink was lodged in the 1. 5-inch-diameter hole, about 5 inches from the bottom of the hole and 1. 5 inches from the top. The kink could not be pulled easily through the hole, probably explaining why the motor stalled and then could not start the cable moving in either direction.

In the removal of the drive unit from the assembly in the hot cell, most of the electrical insulation was accidentally stripped from the lead wires. It appeared that, for some reason, probably radiation, the insulation had become quite brittle. After disassembly and decontamination, the 1-C assembly, less the cable drive unit, was returned to the reactor area. Replacement parts for the drive unit were ordered so that a complete assembly could be prepared as a spare.

At low temperatures, radiation from fission products can produce free fluorine in frozen fuel salt. Because of concern over possible effects of fluorine in samples intended for oxide or U analyses, a carrier was designed and built to keep a fuel sample at about 500°F from the time it is removed from the sampler until it is unloaded at the analytical laboratory. The carrier uses molten babbitt (85% Pb—10% Sb—5% Sn) as shielding and a heat reservoir. Built-in electric heaters melt the babbitt before the sample is loaded, and the heat of fusion keeps the temperature from decreasing significantly for about 9 hr. The time required to get the sample from the pump bowl to the carrier cannot be reduced much below 2 hr, but the hot carrier prevents this period from being extended during shipment or storage.

Taken from the sampler-enricher into a specially prepared open-bottomed lead coffin, bagged, and stored in a spare cell at the reactor site until plans could be worked out for decontamination. These plans were complicated because a facility had to be found that could contain the 3000-lb coffin, with capabilities for removing the coffin from the assembly, disassembling the mechanism, and then decontaminating it. Such a facility was found in the Fission Products Development Laboratory of the Isotopes Division.

Some indication of the complexity of the disassembly and decontamination job is given by the photograph of the complete assembly (actually the replacement) shown in Fig. 1. Disassembly began with the very difficult task of remotely uncoupling seven tubing fittings and four bolts to remove the upper plate. Fourteen bolts were then removed from the cover plate, removing the cover.

Plate permitted some inspection of the drive unit, but it was necessary to unbolt two more bolts to lift out that mechanism. All the rest of the assembly was involved in the decontamination.

Decontamination was done in two stages: the first in the Fission Products Development Laboratory, and the second in the Equipment Decontamination Building. Table 2.1 lists the treatments given in each stage and radiation levels before and after. The readings shown before the first stage were made 15 weeks after the last sample was taken with the mechanism, and the readings after the final stage were taken too.

At the conclusion of the decontamination procedure, levels were low enough that the unit could be worked on directly.

The camera used in the studies is shown in Fig. 2.2. It consists essentially of a thick-walled lead box with an aperture that allows gamma rays and visible light to strike film at the other end of the box. Sheet film is inserted in a slot using a standard 4- by 5-in. film cassette. The aperture is a thin section of aluminum, ⅜ in. in diameter, through which gamma rays can penetrate, pierced. There is no shutter—exposures are long and are satisfactorily controlled by other means. In the tests described here, the lights were turned on and off, and the gamma ray source was moved into and out of the field. In a field application, the film would simply be inserted and removed.

Test photographs were made of a 20-curie 19 Ir source, located in a well-lit shielded room. Some were made with the camera only 12 in. from the source, giving a radiation level at the camera of 110 r/hr, which is about the radiation level at the top of the MSRE reactor cell. Data and results are given in.

Two of the most significant photographs are visible-light film exposed for 12 min. The source is a ½-in. pellet inside a ½-in. -diam capsule held 12 in. from the camera in front of a scarred wooden table leg. The poster is about 2½ ft behind the source. Visible details were reproduced clearly, but the gamma radiation produced only a dim spot. Figure 2.4 is a photograph of the same setup, but on x-ray film exposed for 3 min. The source spot shows up very clearly, and the visible scene was reproduced well enough to identify the location of the source relative to other objects. In tests with the camera 15 ft from the source, the radiation at the camera was only 0.5 μR/hr.

The source spot was swamped by visible light when the film was exposed simultaneously to light and gamma rays. However, a very clear source spot could be produced on X-ray film exposed only to gamma rays. The source was hardly distinguishable on a composite print, but its location could be determined fairly well by comparison of the two negatives.

In the development of the freeze flanges for the MSRE, a prototype flanged joint was subjected to 103 thermal cycles to determine the sealing and distortion characteristics in simulated reactor startups and shutdowns. These thermal cycles were typical of heating and salt-filling operations.

Examination of the prototype flange during and after the 103 cycles showed no cracks such as would be produced by thermal fatigue. Predictions, based on low-cycle fatigue analyses, were that cracks should be expected at about 300 test cycles. The permissible number of cycles of various kinds on the reactor flanges was based on the same kind of analysis, but the permissible number was set as would be expected. Now, as reported in Sect.

Permissible life. Although they may not reach the permissible limit, it was decided to reactivate the flange thermal cycle test. The purpose is to lend further confidence in the fatigue calculations, and plans are to continue thermal cycling the prototype.

Freeze flange until it cracks, or until the MSRE is coursing through the test. Molten salt is oscillated and finally shut down. Between the two tanks, salt is forced to flow. The Freeze-Flange Thermal Cycle Facility connects the upper tank by pressurizing the lower tank with gas.

The two tanks remain heated at all times, with the molten salt in the lower tank when the system is not in operation. At the start of a thermal cycle, heaters adjacent to the flanges are turned on, and the system is heated until the flange hub reaches a preset temperature. When this temperature is obtained, contacts within a temperature controller are closed, the lower sump is pressurized with helium, and a timer is simultaneously started. Level probes control the flow of salt between the two tanks by alternately pressurizing the lower tank and equalizing the gas pressure. The timer then turns off the pipe heaters, and the salt drains to the lower sump tank. A controlled cooldown is obtained by reducing the setting on the pipe heaters and re-energizing them for a period of time.

The tank temperatures are maintained between the hub of the uninsulated flange. At the time the salt starts to oscillate, it is between 500 and 600°F. Eight to nine hours are required to preheat the pipe to obtain this hub temperature. The salt is then oscillated from one tank to the other for 5 hours.

The original 103 cycles were completed using helium as the cover gas, but when operation was resumed, we attempted to use argon. However, we returned to helium when we found that the operating temperature could not be maintained at the desired level with argon. The history of the upper bore and ring temperatures during a typical thermal cycle using helium as the pressurizing gas is shown in Figure 7. A typical radial thermal gradient during salt oscillation is shown in Figure 8.

At this time, a total of 139 cycles have been completed. The outer surfaces of the flange assembly are visually inspected during and after each cycle. A complete inspection of the flange was made between cycles 103 and 104 when the facility was shut down. This inspection included dye-penetrant inspection of the internal flange face and bore surfaces as well as a dimensional check of the bore.

Pump bowl, thus eliminating the need for the overflow tank used in the present MSRE pump installation. It also differs in having a longer unsupported length of the shaft and a different fission gas stripper. During this six-month report period, work continued on the preparation of the pump and test facility for test operation with molten salt. Installation of the pump tank in the test facility was completed. An electrical furnace for preheating was installed on the pump tank; various thermocouples and electrical preheaters were replaced on the test system. The pressure-measuring devices on the salt flow venturi were replaced, and the necessary thermal insulation was applied to the test loop.

Five more relays failed in the rod scram coincidence matrix. This made a total of seven failures in less than a year out of the 15 relays in the matrix. These relays are 115-volt AC relays operating in a 32-volt DC system. Relays more suited to the service were procured and are ready to install.

Other than test scrams, the control rods were scrammed only twice in the six months. The first scram was caused by the building power failure in October while the reactor was at full power.

The thermocouples are Chromel-Alumel wires enclosed in a Ygein, Hastelloy N, or stainless steel sheath with magnesia insulation. Most junctions are grounded. The sheathed thermocouple stock was commercially manufactured to ORNL specifications, and the junctions and disconnect seals were prepared at the MSRE by ORNL craftsmen.

A total of 1071 thermocouples are installed at the MSRE. Of these, 866 are on the salt systems: 351 on the circulating loops, and the remainder on the drain tanks, drain lines, and freeze valves. Of the 1071 thermocouples, only 9 have failed in more than three years of service. Three others are unserviceable because of damage suffered during the final stages of construction when repair was too difficult to be worthwhile. A breakdown of the failures is given in Table 3.1.

The failure in the fine position synchro transmitter on rod drive No. 2 appears to be an open rotor winding, as in the previous failure reported last period. With the transmitter in this condition, the position indicator on the console tracks normal changes but may lose 180° on rod scrams.

Miscellaneous failures included the airflow switch on a radiator annulus blower. A new switch with a smaller paddle will be tried. The power supply to the single-point level switches in the drain tanks failed because of a cooling blower failure. The blower was replaced, and the power supply was repaired.

Further additions and modifications were made to the instrumentation and control systems as experience revealed the need or desirability of more information for the operators, improved performance, or increased protection. During the report period, there were 26 design change requests directly involving instruments or controls. The more important changes are described below.

To avoid further damage to wiring and equipment resulting from short circuits to ground, isolation transformers were installed in the power supply to the motor control circuits of the fuel sampler-enticher cable drive motor. This permits the entire circuit to float at 115 V above ground potential. Before this revision, one control power conductor was a grounded neutral. The floating circuit will operate normally when only one point is grounded, but a misoperation is likely to occur if two points become grounded at the same time. To avoid two simultaneous grounds, ground-detecting lamps were installed, and all grounds will be corrected as soon.

The design of instrumentation and controls for a fluorinated-fuel-salt filter in transfer line 110 between the fuel storage tank and the fuel drain tanks was started. Eleven mineral-insulated, Inconel-sheathed thermocouples are attached to the salt filter and connected to the patch panel in the main control room. Temperature interlocks are provided to annunciate high temperatures in the filter gas space and to stop the transfer of salt to the fuel drain tanks by closing the fuel storage tank helium supply valve if the temperature of the top flange on the filter gets too high. A helium purge line is also provided at the top of the filter to prevent salt from contacting the flange.

Several additions to the fuel processing plant helium supply system are designed to prevent an accidental fill of the reactor during fuel transfer operations: a pressure relief valve limits the maximum pressure in the line supplying the fuel processing plant to 50 psig; a capillary flow restrictor designed to the same specifications as FE-517 (the drain tank helium supply restrictor) limits the maximum flow rate in the salt filter purge line to a value less than 0. 5 cfm; and a weld-sealed solenoid block valve is installed in the filter purge supply.

Plans are to use the decontamination cell to store traps loaded with UF from the fuel fluorination. A level indicator is located in the transmitter room, and a high-level annunciator is provided in the auxiliary control room.

The helium and standard gas supply systems on the fuel off-gas sampler proved to be inadequate during initial test operations. To obtain the precise flow control required for the purge and calibration operations and to provide better protection for delicate components, a new gas supply system was designed and installed. The volume of all lines to each piece of equipment was reduced to a minimum; special pressure regulators designed for use in chromatograph systems were provided, and additional pressure relief valves were installed.

The spectrum of inherent noise in the MSRE neutron flux signal has been examined in some detail. The data is collected through a special low-noise instrument channel and is digitally recorded on magnetic tape by the on-line computer.

A considerable amount of data was collected in run 14 with particular emphasis on the series of experiments at 5 Mw. The most prominent feature of all the noise spectra is a peak at about 1 hertz (see Fig. 1). In general, this peak increased.

Amplitude under conditions where the fraction of circulating voids increased. Figure 3. 1 shows two noise spectra which illustrate this effect. Other variations were also observed, and detailed correlations of the noise spectra with other reactor data are being attempted.

Because of the smaller fraction of delayed neutrons from U-233 fission, the prompt power response to a sudden reactivity change will be about three times as large as for the present U-235 fuel loading. Conceivably, this increased high-frequency.

Again, could cause enough overshoot following a control rod adjustment that the rod servo controller would hunt excessively. Thus, it was desired to determine in advance if any changes would be necessary in the servo system to have it function properly with 7% fuel.

A method was devised to test the capability of the servo system for controlling the reactor with 233 fuel. Basically, it consisted of modifying the flux signal to the servo system so that the apparent response to a rod change closely resembled that from the 253U system. Appropriate resistors and capacitors would be wired around existing elements in the servo network (see Fig. 2) so that the flux input signal would have a high-frequency gain about three times normal but an identical steady-state value.

Before the experiment was conducted on the reactor, the method was tested by analog simulation. The simulator used essentially the same model of the MSRE that was used in the operator training simulator, except that only three delayed neutron groups were used, and the external fuel circuit was represented by a third-order system. Three conditions were simulated: the MSRE with 755U fuel and with 753U fuel, both with an unmodified servo system, and the reactor with 35U fuel.

The three systems react to a 0.5-MW load change and a step reactivity change of 0. 01% 5k/k, respectively. It is apparent that the 755U + RC system closely follows the 33U system response for fast changes. Table 3.2 further illustrates the success of the RC networks in making the 05U response approach that of the 255U system. Thus, the analog results showed that the modification of the 35U system response was approximately correct for high-frequency changes (> 0).

With confidence established that the addition of an RC network would provide a meaningful simulation, the experiment was performed on the reactor. After the proper RC elements were attached to the circuit, the system was perturbed in small amounts in three different ways: (1) a shim rod was inserted ~0.5 in.

0. 5 MW, and (3) the outlet temperature demand was changed by 3°F. After each of these tests, the system was allowed to reach equilibrium and was then returned to its original state by a reversal of the initial procedure. The ability of the controller to correct for large changes was tested by a 2. Did the regulating rod oscillate abnormally? When the demand was increased, the rod oscillated for about 25 sec (six withdraws and six inserts) but then steadied out without external interference. The conclusion was that at least when the reactor operates at high power, the present rod servo system will be adequate and will not introduce undue rod oscillations. Because the highest gain relative to the servo dead band occurs at lower powers, the situation may not be as favorable, but minor adjustments should be all that is required for 54U operation.

As part of the analysis of the MSRE with 753U-bearing fuel, a detailed simulation of the system was set up on an analog computer. The simulation included the period-scram circuits that cause the control rods to scram after the period becomes shorter than 1 sec. This could not be conveniently included explicitly in the digital calculations because of the complex dependence of the scram signal on the initial neutron level, the gamma background, and the history of the flux and the period as it approaches 1 sec. Results from these analog studies were combined with digital calculations to describe the behavior of the reactor under.

Some preliminary analog studies were made to assess the performance of the servo controller with 235U fuel based on estimated values of instrument time lags and rod-drive-motor inertial effects. It appears that the controller will be quite adequate when operating at the higher powers associated with the temperature mode of control. There was some indication of "hunting at very low power levels while operating in the flux mode of control. These results support those obtained from the in-situ test of the actual servo control system developed to measure control rod accelerations and coastdowns experimentally. These will be incorporated into the analog simulation to more accurately predict the performance of the control system with 7350 fuel.

Reactor physics studies in support of the future operation of the MSRE with a 235U fuel loading were extended to aid in evaluating the nuclear safety of the system. Use was made of results of previous computational studies of the neutronic properties of the system with 235U fuel, and emphasis was given to the analysis of some abnormal situations which could conceivably lead to nuclear excursions. To perform these studies, we used the reactor kinetics—digital simulation code ZORCH, developed for the calculation of large transients in power, temperature, and pressure in the MSRE. In the evaluation of nuclear safety for the 235U loading, however, we have attempted, where possible, to take advantage of experience gained from both simulation studies and reactor operation with the present fuel salt. Thus, from the standpoint of magnitudes and rates of reactivity addition and initial reactor conditions, some incidents considered in the original safety analysis could either be judged unrealistic or less severe than others. As was the case with the present fuel loading, the potentially most severe nuclear.

Excursions with a 33U fuel salt were found to be associated with two postulated incidents. One incident results from the sustained withdrawal of the three reactor control rods at maximum rate with the initial neutron level very low, near-source conditions. The other incident involves the gradual separation of uranium from the main stream of circulating salt during routine operation of the reactor, followed by the rapid return of the uranium in concentrated form to the core. We have performed digital simulation studies of the consequences of these incidents to determine both the inherent shutdown capabilities of the system (through temperature-reactivity feedback) and also the effectiveness of the reactor safety system in initiating control rod scrams to suppress the excursions. Though the latter is of principal concern in these studies, it is of interest to obtain the approximate relations between these reactivity addition incidents and the inherent shutdown capabilities of the reactor, without action of the safety-scram system. This comparison is described further in the results summarized in the following sections.

In addition to these simulation studies, in order to further elucidate the nuclear safety consequences of changing to a 35U fuel salt, we have compared simulations of these incidents with 35U and with the present 735U fuel loading; the latter calculated using updated values of the MSRE neutronic characteristics obtained since the earlier nuclear safety studies.

In this hypothetical accident, a nuclear excursion is produced by the sustained withdrawal of the three control rods, with the reactor passing through criticality when the rods are near the position of maximum differential worth. The restrictions and control interlocks that would prevent this type of incident from occurring are described in ref. 6. In this section, we will summarize the results of digital simulations of the accident, including the most severe conditions that would result without consideration of the action of the safety system and the effect of this action in initiating rod scram and terminating the excursion.

To define initial conditions in the rod-withdrawal incident, we have assumed that the reactor is loaded with excess uranium equivalent in reactivity to the worth of one control rod (2. 75% Δk/k). The reactor is initially subcritical by the insertion of all three rods, the fuel is circulating, and the core temperature is uniform at 1200°F. The initial fission rate is quite low, near a low limit determined by the strength of the inherent a,n source in the 733 fuel (approximately 1 w). The three rods are now assumed to be withdrawn in unison through criticality when the rods are approximately 28 in. above the position of maximum insertion, which is approximately 3 in. In this region, the rod motion would correspond closely to a ramp addition of reactivity of 0. 093% per sec. Without consideration of the action of the safety system, a short time after criticality is reached, sufficient reactivity would be added to produce a prompt-critical excursion. This would be terminated by temperature feedback due to nuclear heating of the fuel. The rate would then decrease gradually until the rods reached their upper limits.

These characteristics are exhibited by results of digital calculations of the power-temperature-pressure excursion, shown in Fig. 4. 1. For these calculations, initial steady-state conditions at a power level of 1 W were assumed, and the rod withdrawal was assumed to begin at time zero, near the position of maximum differential worth. Both the temperature of the fluid at the hottest point in the reactor channel and the outlet temperature of the hottest channel are plotted in Fig. 4. 1. (As described in reference 2, the digital model includes a detailed numerical treatment of the axial convection of heat by fluid motion during the power transient). The calculated pressure surge during the period of very rapid heating, also shown in Fig. 4. 1, results primarily from the effects of acceleration of fluid in the outlet pipe. A description of the mathematical model for the pressure rise calculation is included in reference 3.

In order to illustrate the importance of the differences in neutronics characteristics in changing the loading from the present 55U-bearing salt to a 233 salt, we also performed calculations similar to those of for the present fuel composition. To simplify this comparison, we assumed that the reactivity addition rates were identical (0. 093% δk/k/sec) and also that the initial neutron levels were identical (1 W). However, by making these assumptions, the nuclear excursions can be compared simply on the basis of the differences in delayed neutron fractions, temperature coefficients of reactivity, and prompt-neutron generation time for the two fuels. The resulting nuclear transients calculated for the 05U fuel are shown in It is evident that the rapid portion of the transient occurs later in time with 235U than with the 730U fuel, since more reactivity must be added to reach the prompt-critical condition.

The calculations shown in Fig. 1 for the 3°U fuel indicate that the fuel temperature and core pressure rise incurred during the rapid portion of the transient would be inconsequential in terms of conservative limits specified in the nuclear safety analysis (340°F and 50 psi).

In the incidents of the type considered in these studies, the first two are the active mechanisms. In all our simulation studies, we have assumed (1) that only two of the three control rods drop on request, (2) a time delay of 100 ms occurs between scram signal and the start of rod drop, and (3) the rod acceleration is 10 ft/s. Figure 4.3 shows the results of actuating the rod scram due to increases in the neutron flux above the 11.25-MW level. This mechanism would be effective in limiting the nuclear excursion to inconsequential proportions. Actually, a safety scram would occur earlier than indicated by Fig. 4.3 due to reactor periods smaller than 1 sec. The digital calculations for this transient showed that a 1-sec period is reached at approximately level at 5.3 sec, and the maximum power, limited by temperature feedback, at 5.8 sec. Thus, calculations based on quite conservative assumptions of the actual time of actuation of the period scram showed that the power transient would be at least two orders of magnitude below that shown.

The inclusion in the nuclear safety calculations of an incident involving the gradual separation of uranium from the circulating salt and its rapid concentration and return to the reactor core is based on the existence of two possible avenues for chemical separation of uranium from the molten fluoride salt. One avenue requires the loss of enough fluorine from the salt to ultimately result in the production of metallic uranium. Precautions are taken to avoid contaminations, and evidence accumulated from chemical analyses during operation with the present ^55U-bearing fuel salt has indicated no trends in either of these directions toward uranium separation. Although we expect these trends to continue when the reactor is operated with ^53U, the existence of these remote possibilities motivates the analysis of a hypothetical nuclear incident of this type.

In uranium concentration, we then assume that, by some mechanism, this concentrated uranium is suddenly dispersed throughout the 10 ft of fuel salt in the lower head of the reactor vessel and is carried upward through the channeled region of the core by the fluid motion, producing a nuclear excursion. It is clear that the assignment of a single magnitude or rate of addition of reactivity in this incident is not possible, as was the case with the simulation of the uncontrolled rod withdrawal. Thus, it was necessary to study the consequences of the uranium separation incident as a function of the amount of uranium (or reactivity) lost and also of the initial reactor operating conditions. The principal aim of the analysis was to compare the magnitude of the reactivity loss, which would be required to produce severe rises in temperature.

And pressure during the excursion associated with the return of all the lost uranium, with the magnitude of anomalous reactivity loss, which could be detected by routine computer monitoring of the reactivity balance. As in the case of the uncontrolled rod withdrawal incident, the nuclear excursions were simulated both with and without the safety scram of the control rods.

Although the magnitude of reactivity loss was considered as a parameter in the analysis, for the conditions defined above, the time-dependent shape of the reactivity addition during the uranium return would be largely determined by the fluid dynamics of the core and by the spatial distribution of nuclear importance. Figure 4.4 shows the time dependence of the reactivity calculated from the flow velocities observed in the MSRE hydraulic mockup vessel and normalized to Δk, the magnitude of the original reactivity loss. Equivalently, Δk would be the reactivity effect of all the separated uranium if it were uniformly dispersed throughout the 70 ft of salt in the loop rather than concentrated in the salt moving through the core. From Fig. 4, the maximum total reactivity which could be added to the core is 4.9 Δk, and the maximum rate of addition is 1.35 Δk/sec.

In choosing the initial reactor operating conditions for this incident, we have assumed that the lowest initial power level would be 1 kW and that the maximum power would be 7.2 MW. The former value is about ten times smaller than the lowest steady power at which the reactor would be routinely operated. The initial inlet fuel temperature was assumed to be 1200°F in all the calculations.

For a typical calculated incident of this type in which there is no safety rod scram, 0.5 shows the transient behavior of the fuel salt temperature at the hottest point in the core and also the transient salt temperature at the outlet of the hottest channel. Here, the initial power level is 1 kW, and the original reactivity loss Δk is 0.25% in multiplication factor. Associated with the rapid rise portion (t > 3.5 sec) of the curve for the maximum fuel temperature are prompt-critical excursions in power and core pressure qualitatively similar to those shown in 0.1. The maximum pressure rise for this case was about 39 psi. In 0. 5, the temperatures ultimately reach a maximum.

Then decrease as the concentrated uranium is again removed from the core. The dependencies of these peak pressures and temperatures on the initial power level and on the magnitude of Ak are shown that, for the case of Ak = 0. This prompt rise in pressure results mainly from the expansion of the core fluid and consequent fluid acceleration effects, which depend on the rate of increase in the power level. 2 MW and 1 kW. For values of Ak larger than about 0. 25%, the temperature rise is nearly independent of the initial power. These cases correspond to reactivity additions well above prompt critical, in which the graphite temperature change is relatively small, and the fuel temperature increase depends on the integral of the power.

Of the reactivity addition and delayed neutron effects tend to control the response characteristics. The dependence of the magnitude of the pressure rise on Ak is also shown in Fig. 7. The curve corresponds to an initial power level of 1 kW. 2 MW would be quite large.

The preceding calculations take no account of the control rod safety scram action in suppressing the nuclear excursion. An indication of the influence of the initial reactor conditions and the magnitude of reactivity addition on the action of the safety scram system is provided by the curves shown as a function of the initial power level, the relative sequence in time of achieving various conditions during the transient: (1) a 1-sec period, (2) a Yrsec period, (3) high neutron level (11. 25 MW), and (4) peak power conditions with only inherent shutdown by temperature feedback effects.

Smaller than 1 second would considerably precede the conditions of high neutron level over all but the highest indicated initial operating power. At these high power levels, the smaller fractional increment in power required to reach 11. 25 MW reduces the time interval relative to that of the peak temperature conditions.

In an analogous fashion, 0.9 shows the dependence of this time sequence on the magnitude of Ak for an initial power of 1 kW. Although the times to obtain each condition following the start of the incident are reduced, the time increments between the curves tend to become constant.

As would be expected, when the safety rod scram is taken into account, the magnitude of Δk required to produce substantial rises in temperature and pressure is increased. Figure 4.10 shows the effect of the scram of two rods initiated by the 11. The curves shown correspond to an initial power level of 1 kW. For the scales shown, temperature-pressure rises corresponding to 7.2 MW initial power would be negligible. As power levels, scrams due to a short period would actually precede the high neutron level condition.

Thus, the results shown in 0. 10 may be used as conservative upper limits on the temperature-pressure rises for these reactivity magnitudes. Based only on these limits, recoveries in uranium corresponding to Ak, 0.78%, could occur without exceeding the 340°F maximum temperature rise criterion for limiting thermal stresses to safe values. In order to increase this level to a more realistic but still conservative value, a detailed simulation of the action of the short-period-scram mechanism was required. These results are described later in this section.

Simulation calculations correspond to directly comparing the responses of the MSRE to an incident of this type with the two fuel loadings. The normalized reactivity-addition curve shown in Fig. 4 can also be used for the 7% U fuel since the core hydraulics are unchanged, and the spatial distributions of nuclear importance are very nearly.

It can be seen from. 11 that the temperature rise corresponding to a given value of Δk is higher for the 3°U fuel salt, in approximately the inverse ratio of the fuel-temperature coefficients of reactivity for the two loadings. Because of the larger delayed neutron fraction for 235U, a larger addition of reactivity is required to reach the prompt-critical condition. This is evidenced in. 11 by the larger value of Δk required to produce substantial nuclear heating, starting from a low initial power level. In.

In order to further investigate the upper limits of reactivity addition that could be tolerated in this type of incident with 35U fuel, some analog simulation studies of the MSRE were made. The analog model included a representation of the dependence of the period scram signal on the initial neutron level, the gamma background, and the history of the nuclear transient prior to scram. In general agreement with the results shown in Figure 8, the analog calculations showed that, for initial power levels above about 7 MW, the high neutron level trip would actuate the scram signal. At less than 7 MW, the period trip would actuate. The time to start a rod scram varied between 300 and 800 msec, with the shorter times corresponding to higher Ak and low initial power.

Typical reactivity inputs in these cases are shown in Fig. 13. Before a rod scram, the input is very small, and the resulting power transient is also small. This implies that the excursions of potential harm are those that could overcome the available shutdown worth of the rods. In these analyses, this was assumed to be 4. 0%, corresponding to the worth of two rods, dropping from an initial position of 44 in. , in the shadow of the third rod over their entire length of travel. Thus, reactivity additions large enough to cause a secondary nuclear excursion correspond to Δk > 0. 82%, as seen from Fig. 13. The analog model tends to reach a peak temperature faster than the digital calculation, but at a lower magnitude. These models assume somewhat different mechanisms for heat transport within the core. The analog model uses a 27-lump representation of the MSRE core, within which "well-stirred conditions are maintained."

Peak hot-channel outlet temperatures as a function of both Ak and initial power level are shown. Ak of about 1. 07% would be required before the tolerable temperature limits were exceeded. A more conservative value of 0. 96% was obtained from the digital calculation. Both models indicated that the peak temperature was not very dependent on the initial power level, particularly for the higher values of Ak.

Initial power level and peak pressure were discussed in the preceding sections. In order to obtain an upper limit on the maximum pressure rise, an initial power level of 100 W was chosen. Projection of the calculated data to 100 W initial power shows that an Ak of 0. 95% could be tolerated without exceeding the conservative 50-psi limit in pressure rise assigned in the safety analysis.

Experience with these calculations, accumulated during a substantial part of the operation with the present 5U loading, has been described in ref. 9. At steady power, temperature, and pressure, we have found that the variation in consecutive reactivity balances is about 10.01% Δk/k. This value represents the probable limit of precision in the technique. Longer-term variations in the residual reactivity can be due either to systematic errors in the calculation of known reactivity effects or to anomalous changes whose detection is important, such as the hypothetical situation considered in the preceding section. The long-term reactivity variations that have been observed with the present fuel salt have been very small. A systematic variation as small as 0. 05% Δk/k would.

This means that the reactivity balance calculations can be expected to be more sensitive to variation in uranium content. For example, removal of 1 g of ^233U from the salt, by burnup or any other mechanism, may be expected to produce a reactivity reduction nearly four times that of 1 g of ^235U in the present fuel. An abnormal reactivity loss of 0.10% Δk/k would correspond approximately to a 0.26% reduction in uranium concentration (of isotopic composition to be used for the new loading), which is a total loss of about 80 g of uranium from 70.5 ft of circulating salt.

The primary objective of the engineering design and development activities of the MSR program is to design a molten-salt breeder experiment (MSBE) and develop the components and systems for that reactor. The MSBE is proposed to be a model of a large power breeder reactor. Most of the design and development effort is being spent on studies of reference designs of 1000 MW (electrical) and larger power plants to provide the criteria and much of the basis for the design of the MSBE.

These studies were begun in September 1965. The results are reported in four semiannual progress reports through August 1967 and in ORNL-3996, Design Studies of 1000-Mw(e) Molten-Salt Breeder Reactors. Based on the studies, a two-region reactor with fissile and fertile materials in separate fuel and blanket salt streams was chosen as the most promising approach to the breeder. Factors related to fuel and blanket processing were the most important considerations in reaching this conclusion. A fluoride volatility process was available for separating uranium efficiently from fuel and blanket streams. A distillation process had been conceived for separating the LiF and BeF salts from rare-earth fission products in the fuel salt. Separation of 33pa from the blanket salt was not essential to achieve breeding, although such separation appeared to be possible and offered promise of improving the breeding performance and the.

One of the new developments was evidence that 233Da and possibly the rare-earth fission products can be separated from the mixed thorium-uranium fuel salt of a one-fluid reactor by reductive extraction methods employing liquid bismuth. The second new development was the calculation that the leakage of neutrons from the core of a one-fluid reactor of modest size can be reduced to desirable levels by increasing the ratio of fuel salt to graphite to produce a greatly undermoderated region in the outer part of the core. By optimizing the distribution of salt, the reduction in leakage can be accomplished with a low specific inventory of fissile material. These developments, when combined with the greater simplicity and potential reliability, make the one-fluid breeder a more attractive concept than the two-fluid breeder, which must rely on graphite piping in the core to separate fuel and blanket streams.

Our current design studies of large one-fluid breeders are aimed at describing those reactors sufficiently for us to select a size and a design basis for a one-fluid breeder experiment. Development work is limited to analyses in support of the design and to experiments that are relevant.

Our version of a 1000 MW (electrical) power plant based on the two-fluid MSBR was described in considerable detail in our last semiannual report. We selected the modular concept in which the plant contained four reactors, each with the capability for generating supercritical steam equivalent to 250 MW (electrical). The core of each reactor was designed to accommodate for a reasonable time the dimensional changes produced by irradiation of the graphite as those changes were deduced from the most recent experimental data. This led to the use of graphite fuel cells in the form of reentrant tubes that were brazed to metal pipes. These pipes were welded into fuel supply and discharge plenums in the bottom of the reactor vessel. The fertile salt filled the interstices between fuel cells and a blanket region around the core.

This reactor presented two major problems. The graphite in the core had to be replaceable for a variety of reasons, and the most acceptable way that had been conceived for replacing the graphite involved replacing the entire core and reactor vessel. Periodic replacement of the reactor vessel appeared to be economical if the frequency were governed entirely by radiation-induced dimensional changes in the bulk graphite. There was, however, concern that mechanical failure of individual graphite cells or graphite-to-metal joints could cause the replacement frequency to become excessive.

The single-fluid reactor has the advantage that the graphite functions only as a moderator. In principle, it can be present in the form of long bars with no firm connections at the top or bottom. The bars can be removed individually or in groups; the lifetime of the graphite should depend only on the bulk changes in dimensions that result from irradiation. There are also subsidiary advantages related to the amount and arrangement of the reactor equipment.

In the beginning, we expected that the reactor would have to be a 20-ft diameter right cylinder or larger in order for the neutron leakage to be acceptably low. A power output of 2000 MW (electrical) or greater per reactor then became necessary to achieve a low specific inventory. We believe that power plants of this size will be common in the 1980s when large molten-salt reactors could be built so we based our design studies on a 4444 MW (thermal), 2000 MW (electrical) plant. We have since found that zoning the core permits one to obtain good breeding performance from 1000 MW (electrical) and possibly from smaller reactors.

The fuel salt for the one-fluid reactor contains both fissile and fertile atoms in LiF-BeF2 carrier. The composition and our estimates of the properties are shown in Table 5.1. In the flow diagram, this salt is circulated by four pumps through a common reactor vessel. Each pump circulates approximately 27,000 gpm of salt through the reactor and a heat exchanger. The salt enters the reactor at 1050°F and leaves at a mean temperature of 1300°F.

The coolant salt—sodium fluoroborate—is pumped in four heat transfer circuits, one for each fuel circuit. Each pump circulates 53,000 gpm of coolant salt through a primary heat exchanger and through several superheaters and reheaters. Since 850°F is below the liquidus temperature of the fuel salt, some 1125°F salt is bypassed around the superheater and mixed with the exit salt so that the temperature of the coolant returning to the primary heat exchanger is 950°F.

Each coolant salt loop has four superheaters, making a total of 16 units in the plant. Steam enters the superheaters at 700°F and exits at 1000°F. Steam enters the reheaters at 600°F and is heated to 1000°F for return to the turbine.

With the new reactor and the higher power, our entire concept of the overall power breeder plant has to be reevaluated. Such concepts as the basic idea for the thermal shield and the double containment are still valid, but we have devoted only a little time to the layout of the new plant and have not examined those details.

A plan view of a possible arrangement of the various cells is shown in Fig. 2. The reactor vessel, four heat exchangers, and four fuel pumps are located in the reactor cell. This cell is circular and is about 52 ft in diameter by 47 ft deep. It has a thermal shield to prevent overheating of the concrete. It also has double containment; with a pump-back system whereby the integrity of the containment is constantly monitored.

Four steam-generating cells are located symmetrically in relation to the reactor cell. The cells are approximately 33 ft wide by 46 ft long by 43 ft deep. They contain only coolant salt and steam and therefore have no need for a thermal shield or double containment. These cells are isolated from the reactor cell and from the highbay area by bellows seals around pipes that communicate with those areas.

In order for salt to drain by gravity from the reactor into the drain tank, double containment is provided since radioactive salt is stored there. The drain tank cell is about 28 ft wide by 49 ft long by 38 ft deep. It is isolated from the reactor cell by bellows seals around the communicating.

63 ft long and 43 ft deep. This cell must be doubly contained, but the ambient temperature is around 100°F, so it needs no electrical space heaters or thermal insulation. Cooling of the gas holdup tanks and the charcoal absorber beds is done by water, which comes from the plant feedwater system.

The chemical processing cell is about 18 ft wide, 63 ft long, and 43 ft deep. This cell must have double containment, but it too does not require space heaters or thermal insulation. In this cell, the pieces of apparatus are heated and cooled.

The off-gas, chemical processing, and instrumentation cells shown in Fig. 2 are meant to be only representative since no serious design effort has been put on them. The reactor, fuel drain tank, and steam cells have been laid out sufficiently to show the arrangement of the components in some detail. These cell arrangements are.

Our arrangement of equipment for the one-fluid reactor is based on one-pass upward flow of fuel through the reactor vessel. This once-through flow allows the reactor and heat exchangers to be at the same elevation. The pumps are at the top of the reactor and have drive shafts that may be short enough to eliminate the need for molten-salt bearings. The heat exchangers are mounted so that they move, and the thermal stresses are accommodated without the use of expansion loops or expansion joints in the fuel piping. We have used bellows in the coolant salt piping. We hope to be able to do this, for the coolant pipes are 34 inches in diameter, and expansion loops for such sizes are.

In the steam cell, all components are anchored solidly. Expansion in pipelines is taken up by bellows in the pipes. The high-pressure steam and feedwater lines have large expansion loops outside the cells to allow for dimensional changes in those lines.

We have considered several concepts for the single-fluid reactor vessel and core. Studies have been made to try to attain the best combination of fuel inventory, flow control, temperature control, and ease of removal of the graphite from the reactor. A major complicating factor in the design is the radiation-induced dimensional changes.

We spent considerable effort in an attempt to employ reentrant concentric tubes of graphite for the fuel passages in the core. By confining the salt to such tubes and filling the spaces between tubes with gas, the changes in salt volume caused by the dimensional changes in graphite are insignificant. This design, however, made necessary some kind of metal-to-graphite joint that had to be relatively leakproof, and these joints would have to be broken to replace the graphite. Also, the gas spaces in the core presented voids which could fill with salt and greatly increase the reactivity under certain conditions. Gravity flow from the reactor vessel to the pump suction tank was believed to be desirable, but the inventory required to achieve this was excessive. The concentric reentrant tube concept was abandoned as having too many of the disadvantages of our designs for two-fluid reactors and none of the.

The idea of a container filled with vertical graphite pieces of some shape with fuel in the spaces between graphite pieces and flowing in a single pass upward through the vessel was finally adopted for the basic design. With this configuration, two possibilities for disposing of the graphite within the vessel come to mind. One involves simply stacking graphite inside the vessel, each piece contacting the neighboring pieces, and the entire bundle being finally restrained by the reactor vessel or by a crate-like structure within the vessel.

Changing location within the core required various schemes to be attempted to try to cause some force (e. g. , hydraulic pressure drop, buoyancy) to compact the core as irradiation caused the pieces to shrink. To date, we have found no practical method of overcoming this "crevassing of the core. " We, therefore, prefer another design.

One way to be sure that the liquid volume will increase uniformly within the core as the graphite shrinks is to locate each piece of graphite at the top and bottom of the reactor by a metal structure that is dimensionally stable. The method of confining the graphite at these locating points is important. The attachment must present a minimum of difficulty in the removal of the graphite. It must accommodate dimensional changes of the graphite without undue restraint.

In addition to positioning the graphite, means must be provided for supporting the considerable load of the graphite in the core. When the reactor is empty, this is a gravity load at the bottom of the vessel. When the pumps are running, there is an additional large upward force caused by the pressure drop across the core.

We have investigated many configurations of vessels with reinforced flat heads, dished heads, and inverted dished heads. We tried circumferential fluid entry through transition sections from pipes to the reactor vessel. A design which seems to offer the best embodiment of the desired features is shown in elevation in Figure 6. Some important parameters for the reactor are listed in Table 5.2.

The vessel is about 18 ft in diameter by 24 ft high. It has a standard dished head at the bottom. In the center is a 4-ft-diameter manifold into which the 24-in. outlet line from each heat exchanger discharges, and the four streams mix in the plenum formed by the dished head of the reactor vessel.

Plate locates and supports the weight of the graphite stringers comprising the center part of the reactor core. The support plate is drilled on an even square pitch, and nipples for receiving the round ends of the moderator stringers are welded into these holes. These nipples serve as orifices for controlling flow and as sockets for locating the graphite pieces.

The outer region of the core is mounted in thimbles, the same as the center region. Flow in this outer region is greatly reduced compared to that required in the center. This flow is obtained from the pool below the center region of graphite stringers and may be regulated by orificing the flow channels through and around the graphite.

Near the top of the reactor vessel, a square grid is welded to the vessel. The squares in this grid are large enough to contain nine of the core pieces. This grid locates the top ends of the pieces so that each group of nine is exactly positioned within the core.

Thick. In order for the graphite to fit closely, the top 16 inches of each piece is reduced in cross-section to permit its insertion past the grid. The center piece of graphite is inserted last and serves as a key to tighten the group. To remove the graphite, the center piece must be removed.

With the sockets at the bottom and the grid structure at the top of the vessel, the graphite is supported freely and is retained in one radial position. It is free to float in the salt and must be restrained by some load-bearing structure at the top. This lid is held down by I-beams clamped at the perimeter. A seal weld is made for leak-tightness only. In each of the grid openings above the graphite stringers, we have a metal spider with a center rod which transmits the buoyant and pressure forces to the reinforced lid of the vessel. This spider also has provision for orificing the flow of salt as it leaves the core in order to help control the distribution of flow.

For nuclear reasons (discussed in the physics section), the volume fraction of fuel in the core is nonuniform. As currently conceived, the core has three regions characterized by different salt fractions. The central one-sixth of the core, region 1, contains 19 vol% salt; the surrounding one-third, region 2, contains 17 vol% salt; and the outer one-half, region 3, contains 44 vol% salt. The power production per unit volume of salt in region 1 is nearly uniform. It decreases to about 27% of the center value at the outer edge of region 2 and to 3% of the center value near the outer edge of region 3. We would like for the temperature rise of the fuel that passes through the core to be nearly uniform and equal to the specified mean temperature rise. This is desirable in order to prevent overheating in the center of the core and to conserve on total flow through the.

Many configurations of core pieces have been examined in an attempt to achieve the desired distributions of fuel volume and flow. The one we presently like best is shown in Fig. 7. The graphite element is 4 inches square with the edges contoured, and the center cored to obtain the specified salt fraction in each region. The design appears to eliminate places where salt could stagnate and overheat.

To permit the salt to flow freely through all the channels, in the regions 2 and 3, the channels around the pieces, which are more difficult to orifice, will be reduced in thickness as the heat production decreases, and the channels through the pieces, which are more easily orificed, will be increased in size to obtain the desired fuel fraction. By distributing the salt in this manner, providing some orificing of the channels between pieces, and carefully orificing the channels in the centers of the pieces, we hope to obtain a nearly uniform radial pressure in the interconnecting channels across the core. This should minimize the crossflow between core regions at the expense of a small increase in total flow and decrease in the overall temperature rise of the fluid.

We have not designed a heat exchanger for the one-fluid reactor. What we have done is to scale up the heat transfer surface from previous calculations, base the length on the height of the reactor vessel, and calculate the diameter required to provide the desired capacity. The heat exchangers now have one-pass flow of both fuel and coolant salt. The pumps are not integral with the heat exchanger; although, they can be made so if further analysis shows it to be desirable.

We have spent a large part of our design effort on a system for removing afterheat from fuel salt in the drain tanks. With the modular plant design of the two-fluid reactor, we proposed to cool the drain tanks by reheat steam from the high-pressure turbine. Since the likelihood of having more than two of the four modules drained at any one time is small, the supply of this cooling steam should be dependable. With a single reactor, this is no longer true, and steam cooling, while still possible, looks less attractive.

Another basic change to the drainage system results from our arrangement of equipment for the one-fluid reactor. A stopped pump no longer drains the reactor. We presently see no reason for draining the reactor quickly and would propose to continue to operate at reduced power for some time with one or possibly more pumps off.

We have one drain tank capable of holding and cooling the entire salt volume (2247 ft) of the reactor primary system. This is a cylindrical tank connected to the primary system through a 12-in. line. This line has a salt valve, at present assumed to be a freeze valve, through which the system drains into the tank. An additional 6-in. line enters the tank near the top. This line is connected through a freeze valve to a drain pan in the reactor pit. In case of failure of a fuel system component, the fuel can be drained into the drain tank through this line. Salt is transferred to the reactor system by pressurizing the drain tank with gas. Figure 5.8 is an elevation drawing of this tank. Figure 5.9 is a plan of the tank showing the manifolding of the cooling coils which remove the afterheat from the fuel.

The cooling is done by U-tubes, which extend into the tank from headers located at the top but below the dished head cover. These are Y-in. between the tubes in each U. The U-tubes are attached to headers, which are arranged on two levels, one level running at right angles to the other level. This arrangement results in coolant tubes on 2%-in. square pitch throughout the volume of the drain tank. The U-tubes are assembled in modules, and these modules are connected together by bringing 1-in. lines through the dished head of the drain tank.

There are many more coolant tubes in the drain tank than are required to remove the heat. We did this at least temporarily in order to reduce the ligament dimension of the fuel to prevent hot spots within the fuel volume. The coolant surface in the drain tank can remove 300 MW, while the maximum load amounts to only 60 MW. In Table 5. 3, we show some design parameters of the drain.

The chimneys are equipped with dampers so that the air coolers are maintained in a stagnant, hot ambient when not required to reject heat. In fact, heaters are provided to keep the air coolers above the melting point of the coolant salt at all times. This system of air coolers, U-tubes in the drain tank, and interconnecting piping is filled with the fluoroborate coolant salt. The salt circulates by natural convection, conveying the heat from the drain tank to the air cooler and dumping it into the atmosphere.

We have only preliminary designs of the air coolers and chimneys. A manufacturer of such chimneys says that a stack about 150 ft high and about 30 ft in diameter will produce a pressure drop of about 1 in. of water, which will be sufficient to remove 60 MW of heat from air coolers in the base of the chimney.

Physics analysis of the MSBR for the period covered by this report was confined to studies of a single-fluid machine. Results of the studies demonstrated that the nuclear performance of a single-fluid reactor could be made as attractive as that of the 40 W/cm^2 two-fluid reactor discussed in previous progress reports. Some of the results presented here should be regarded as preliminary. In the discussion below, a reactor which includes all the most recent design information is identified as the reference reactor. This designation is made for the convenience of identification only. Several revisions to this design are already being studied. For example, it may be desirable to tailor the salt distribution in the axial as well as the radial direction. Also, the reactor fuel cell described below is intended only to show the approximate features of an MSBR single-fluid cell. Instead of having all of the salt surrounding the graphite as depicted below, final cell designs will almost certainly have part of the salt interior to the graphite, partly to maintain suitably low graphite temperatures and partly to achieve the most advantageous self-shielding of thorium resonance cross sections.

A schematic drawing of the most recent one-fluid reactor core is shown in Fig. 1. The core is 16 ft in diameter by 20 ft in length. Radially, the core is surrounded by 1 ft of graphite reflector. Above and below the core are several structural regions which support the core and transport salt.

The appearance of a radially nonuniform volume fraction of salt in the core deserves special discussion because this feature produces a substantial improvement in breeding performance over that of a core with a uniform volume fraction of salt. A uniformly loaded single-fluid reactor can be designed, making the reactor so large that leakage is negligible. However, the large inventory required to fuel such a reactor greatly penalizes the yield. On the other hand, if one introduces a nonuniform loading with relatively small salt volume fractions in the center of the reactor (~17 to 19%) and larger volume fractions (44%) in the outer region, small leakages may be achieved with modest size cores. With this salt distribution, the neutron energy spectrum is harder in the outer region than in the center, the neutron source density near the surface is reduced, and hence leakage is reduced. The nonuniform core may be characterized by saying that the central part of the core acts like a core, and that the outer part, containing the same materials but in different proportions, acts like a blanket. Consequently, a single fluid is effectively made to serve a dual purpose.

References to the core include both regions; specifically, reported power densities are averages over the two zones. Comparison of the highest-yield one-fluid 2000 MW (electrical) uniform core with the highest-yield nonuniform core shows an increase in yield from 4.0 to 5.5%, as well as an increase in breeding ratio from 1.048 to 1.068.

The optimum salt volume fraction distribution, as far as yield is concerned, has a value of 14% in the central one-sixth of the core volume. However, for that core, the thermal flux, and hence the specific power, is strongly peaked in the center of the core, being ~80% higher than shown in Fig. 2. Heat removal from such a strongly nonuniform heat source distribution is difficult. 2. The yield is reduced at most by 0.3%. The considerable simplification of heat removal problems afforded by the flattened source distribution seems to justify the small penalty on yield.

Also, since the fast damage flux distribution closely follows the thermal flux distribution, reducing the peak thermal flux as much as possible is desirable from the standpoint of maximizing the useful lifetime of the graphite in the center of the core. Present calculations indicate that the graphite in the maximum flux region of the reference reactor will have a replacement lifetime of from 2 to 3 years if the graphite lifetime is limited to a fluence of 3.0 x 10^20 nvt (E > 50 keV).

It is instructive to compare the reference reactor with a variety of other designs. An OPTIMERC calculation determined the maximum yield attainable in each case. The comparison, in terms of relative changes in yield and breeding ratio, is shown in Table 6.1.

Comparison of cases 1 through 5 shows that the reference reactor has a higher yield than any uniform core and has the optimum diameter of the nonuniform cases. The optimum axial length, as well as the desirability of a tailored salt distribution in the axial direction, are under investigation.

Comparison of cases 1, 6, and 7 indicates that 12 mole % ThF is nearly the optimum percentage of this salt component. Larger mole percentages give marginally improved nuclear performance while having markedly poorer thermal properties, particularly a higher melting point.

Comparison of cases 1 and 8 shows some incentive for choosing a 2000 MW (electrical) design over a 1000 MW (electrical) design.

Case 9 shows that the reflector is of marginal value so far as neutron economy is concerned. The reflector is of small value because the outer part of the core functions as a blanket. If the reflector should prove to be a complicating or expensive part of the reactor, it could be removed without great penalty to the yield. However, it may be necessary or desirable in any case to use the reflector to shield the reactor vessel against neutron irradiation.

Anticipating the possibility that design problems may somehow necessitate a certain volume of salt outside the core and hence in a largely parasitic region, Case 10 is intended to show that the introduction of a substantial inventory of salt outside the core does not, in fact, greatly impair the performance of the system. To a large extent, this salt pays its way by serving as blanket material and allowing a reduction in the amount of salt in the outer part of the core itself.

Finally, case 11 is presented to show the kind of nuclear performance that can be achieved in a reactor much smaller in size and power output than the reference reactor. In case 11, the volume fraction of salt in the central half of the core is ~14%, and in the outer half, it is ~70%.

With the two-fluid reactors considered in ORNL3996 and in previous reports, Table 6.2 gives pertinent information for both systems. Data are included for two versions of two-fluid breeders for 1000 MW (electrical) power plants. One plant has a single reactor vessel with average and maximum power densities in the core of 80 and 160 kW/liter, respectively. This modular plant, of considerably degraded breeding performance but longer life of graphite under irradiation, was finally selected to be the reference design for the two-fluid breeder plant, primarily on the basis of cost and practicality considerations relative to replacing the graphite.

Since the two-fluid reactors are for 1000 MW (electrical) systems, we should compare them with a 2000 MW (electrical) one-fluid reference reactor included in Table 6.2 for completeness. The numbers are not all consistent, but the reactors should generally be compared on the basis of the maximum power density (life of the graphite) in the core. It should be possible to replace the graphite in a one-fluid reactor more frequently than in a two-fluid reactor for the same cost. From the table, it is clear that, although the two designs are rather different, the overall nuclear per.

Performance of the two systems is quite similar. The principal differences appear in the details of the parasitic losses in the neutron balances of the two systems. However, as shown in the table, the relatively modest differences essentially cancel.

The fuel cycle costs have not yet been fully determined, and hence it is premature to discuss the fuel cycle costs in any detail. However, it is currently felt that fuel cycle costs less than 0. 5 mill/kWh will be achievable with the liquid metal extraction techniques which are being investigated for the one-fluid system.

MSBR fuel cell. The calculations are based on the cell shown schematically in cross section in Fig. in diameter surrounded by a region of salt, occupying 20% of the total cell volume. Conclusions based upon calculations using this cell must be regarded as tentative for several reasons. First, the core of the reference reactor actually contains three different salt volume fractions and hence three different cell designs. Second, an MSBR cell will probably contain a portion of the salt in passages through the graphite, perhaps in a central cylindrical passage. Third, a cell ~4 inches diameter is probably required in order to maintain sufficiently low graphite temperatures.

Figure 6.5 shows flux plots of the total fast flux above 50 keV and total thermal flux below 1.86 eV as a function of radial position in the cell. The curves are shown relative to the cell average fast flux and cell average thermal flux, respectively. The detailed distributions shown for the fluxes in Figure 6.

A number of isothermal reactivity coefficients were calculated using the reference reactor and the cell of 0.4. These coefficients are summarized in Table 6.4. The Doppler coefficient is primarily that of thorium. The graphite spectral coefficient is positive because of the competition between thermal captures in fuel, which decrease less rapidly than 1/v, and thermal captures in thorium, which decrease nearly as 1/v with increasing temperature. The total spectral component includes the Doppler term, the graphite spectral term, and the thermal spectral effects of all important moderators in the salt. The resonance density component represents the effect of decreased self-shielding of thorium with decreasing salt density. The last entry in Table 6.

And the total spectral reactivity coefficients are negative. Third, and perhaps most importantly, the prompt coefficient of the salt, which largely determines the fast transient response of the system, is a relatively large negative coefficient and should afford adequate reactor stability and controllability. Studies of the actual dynamic performance of the system are in progress.

Fuel isotopes: Samples have been taken for this purpose during operation with the 75U loading, and others will be taken during operation with 733U. A precise measurement for the latter would be of interest to the MSBR program since, as discussed by Perry, the uncertainty in the effective value of y for 233U contributes the major uncertainty in the breeding ratio of molten-salt breeders. The measured 733U will be quite comparable with that for proposed MSBR designs because of the similarity, as demonstrated by Prince, of the spectra of MSBR and MSRE. For both 75U and 35U loadings of MSRE, comparisons between measured and calculated values of y provide tests of calculational methods and cross-section data. The first experiment, with 235U, will check procedures and equipment. The result will test the validity of the method and may, indeed, constitute a useful check on the cross-sections of 235U.

The basic idea of the measurement, discussed in terms of ^235U for concreteness, is as follows: Absorptions in ^233U are measured by observing the decrease in ^230Th concentration in the salt over a period of time; power captures in ^223U are measured by observing the increase in ^74U concentration (corrected for absorptions in ^5U itself). These concentrations, and the changes in them, are measured relative to that of ^238U, whose neutron absorption cross section, and hence concentration change, are far smaller than those of either ^75U.

An expression has been developed for the cross-section ratio y in terms of the quantities actually measured by the mass spectrometer and the effective absorption cross sections of 234U and 238U. For the mass spectrometer measurements, one includes: (1) the measured current ratios (e. g. , that in the 743 channel to that in the 230 channel), (2) the instrument calibration factors (e. g. , the relative current sensitivities of channels 233 and 238), (3) interchannel cross-coupling factors (e. g. , the spurious current in channel 234 due to the breadth of the 233 peak), and (4) variation in these instrument factors between measurements on initial and final samples. The ratios of the effective cross sections of 254U and 235U to that of 233U are involved because of the small but significant differences.

Corrections for depletion of 234U and 235U during the course of the experiment: An extensive error analysis has been performed for both the 233U and 235U cases. The uncertainties which appear to limit the attainable precision are those of: (1) the ratio of current in another channel to that in and 238 relative to those of the principal fuel isotopes 235U and 235U (assumed uncertainty +10%). On this basis, it appears that an experiment involving 2% depletion of 235U should measure y to +3. 3%, corresponding to an uncertainty of +0. 008.

In the effective value of 7(35U) in the MSRE spectrum, the corresponding errors for 2% depletion, these uncertainties owing to the measurements themselves, one should add an allowance for the uncertainty inv. Using presently accepted values for these [+0. 32% for ^(233U) and +0. 25% for ^(35y)], one estimates an overall uncertainty of £0. This value may be compared with our present estimate of +0. 015 for the uncertainty in 7(35U) in a typical MSBR spectrum, attributable to uncertainties in neutron cross sections.

The programs concerned with migration of noble gases, the technology of sodium fluoroborate, and the early development of pumps for molten-salt reactors were continued during the period. A study was begun on remote maintenance for MSBRs, including the problems involved in the remote welding of pipes and vessel closures. Studies of the effectiveness of decontamination of small components for subsequent maintenance and of the use of a gamma-ray camera for locating radioactive hot spots—both of which are pertinent to the maintenance plan for an MSBR—are reported in the MSRE section of this report.

The results of Xe poisoning calculations were presented for a specified two-fluid reactor concept in the last semiannual progress report. They showed that the target poison fraction of 0.5% was attainable. Since then, the proposed core has increased in size in order to lower the power density. In addition, the proposed fuel cell geometry has changed to significantly increase the graphite surface area per unit volume of the core. These factors will increase the attainable poison fraction to be between 1 and 2%. As a result, consideration is being given to graphite with a very low-permeability coating.

Calculations were made to determine the effect of coating the graphite with a thin layer of low-permeability graphite. As a reference design, essentially the same reactor concept was used as described in ORNL-4191, but with the core size increased to yield a mean power density of 20.

kW/liter. The fuel cell geometry was also changed somewhat to give a higher specific surface area. The various xenon migration parameters were chosen to obtain a 135Xe poison fraction of 2.25% (high end of the attainable range) with no coating, and then the calculations were extended to include the effects of coatings. The results of these computations appear in Fig. 1. In the coating, the void fraction available to xenon was made variable in such a way that it changed.

By one order of magnitude, the diffusion coefficient changed by two orders of magnitude.

The alterations necessary to convert this test facility, formerly called the Fuel Pump High-Temperature Endurance Test Facility, to operate with sodium fluoroborate were completed. The work included installation of (1) equipment for automatic control of BF, flow through a dip leg in the pump bowl and helium flow to the pump shaft annulus; (2) an access nozzle for removing salt samples from the pump tank; (3) a thermal conductivity cell to monitor the composition of the off-gas stream; and (4) equipment for controlled ventilation of the loop enclosure and instrument cubicles with provisions for venting the discharge above the building roof.

Salt samples will be used for direct indication of salt composition. Devices that will be evaluated for monitoring the composition indirectly are a thermal conductivity cell, which will provide an indication of the BF partial pressure in the offgas stream; and a cold-finger unit, which will check for changes in the liquidus temperature of the salt. The cold-finger system is currently under design and will not be available during the initial period of circulation. 5 mm Hg will result in a change in signal of 2.5% of the indicator scale.

The emphasis on the single-fluid concept has not, however, altered the pump program objectives, and the desire for the strong participation of the United States pump industry in design, development, production, and operation of pumps for the Molten-Salt Breeder Experiment (MSBE).

After evaluation of these proposals, selected pump manufacturer(s) will be asked to design the fuel salt pump and to estimate the cost and schedule to produce a prototype. The cost estimate will include whatever development program the pump manufacturer proposes and their participation in the ORNL pump program.

Familiar with the pump problems. The studies will be used to provide insight and direction to the pump design and development for the industrial participants as well as the Laboratory. Information is now being assembled for use in writing specifications for the fuel salt pump.

Figure 7. 2 shows a preliminary layout of a concept of the fuel salt pump for the single-fluid reactor. Although the capacity is much larger, the pump is similar in configuration to the MSRE salt pumps. The drive motor is mounted in a fixed position on top of the concrete shielding, and the bearing housing is recessed into the shielding to reduce the shaft overhang. The pump shaft is mounted on two pairs of preloaded, oil-lubricated ball bearings. The impeller is overhung about 6 feet below the lower bearing. A preliminary study indicated a first shaft critical speed greater than 1200 rpm.

Internal shielding of the bearing housing is provided by a steel or Hastelloy N shield plug cooled by an organic liquid, possibly the same as the bearing lubricant. To reduce deflections of the shaft at the impeller caused by hydraulic radial forces on the impeller, the pump casing is of either the double-volute (as shown) or the vaned diffuser design to minimize these forces. Both casings have the added advantage of greater structural strength than a single-volute or a vaneless diffuser. At the design temperature of 1300°F, where the allowable stress for Hastelloy N is 3500 psi, this advantage is of considerable importance to the designer.

The drive motor will be installed in a fixed position, and the pump will be permitted to move freely with the thermal expansion of the reactor system. For power transmission, a floating coupling or universal joints will be used to accommodate the approximately 1-inch horizontal and vertical displacements of the pump that are anticipated during operation at temperature. The transmission device will also have design features to accommodate the approximately 5-inch vertical and 1.5-inch horizontal movements that occur between room temperature and reactor cell design temperature. We do not presently anticipate operating the pump at room temperature.

The pump tank provides volume to accommodate the anticipated thermal expansion of the fuel salt at off-design conditions. It is almost completely decoupled hydraulically from the flowing salt in the impeller and volute passages by (1) labyrinth seals installed in the pump casing around the pump shaft and on the periphery of the casing, and (2) bridge tubes that connect the volute to the inlet and outlet nozzles attached to the pump tank. The bridge tubes also eliminate structural redundancies between the pump tank and the volute and its supporting structure.

In a noteworthy fashion, the hydraulic decoupling serves to minimize the changes that may occur in the pump tank liquid level when several pumps are being operated in parallel and one of them stops.

If the salt volume in each pump tank is directly connected to its pump suction, and all pumps are supplied from a common plenum in the reactor, then the following events would occur when one pump stops. The level of salt in the tank of the stopped pump would try to increase by an amount equal to the velocity head at the pump suction plus the head loss in the suction line from the common supply to the pump tank. This change in level would be ten or more feet, representing an unwanted increase in pump shaft length. Additionally, unless there is sufficient reserve salt volume in the other pump tanks to supply the increased salt requirement of the stopped pump, the system fluid would ingas when the salt level in the tanks of the operating pumps is lowered to the level of the pump suction. However, by connecting the liquid in the hydraulically decoupled version of the pump tank to a point in the reactor plenum where the velocity changes.

Although not shown in Figure 2, the upper portion of the pump tank and its internal structure will be cooled by a small bypass flow of the fuel salt to remove beta and gamma heat. A study using an existing heat transfer program (SIFTTOSS) is in progress to determine the temperature distribution in the pump shaft and shaft casings. The first case being solved assumes full-power gamma heating on one half of the shaft casing and no gamma heating on the other half. The results of the first case will indicate the next case to be.

A preliminary investigation has been made of the capacity of the fuel salt pump and its speed on various pump parameters such as impeller diameter, net positive suction head required (NPSH), hydraulic efficiency, and shaft diameter. The results are shown in 3.

There is sufficient similarity in the design head, speed, temperature, and power characteristics of the fuel and coolant salt pumps (see Table 7.1) that it appears feasible to interchange the rotary elements (except for the impellers) and the drive motors. Interchangeability could lead to considerable savings in the MSBE salt pump program.

The design was initiated for a molten-salt pump test facility, which will provide adequate non-nuclear testing capabilities for the MSBE salt pumps. Basically, the facility will consist of the necessary piping system, heat sink (preferably to air), variable flow restrictor, flow measuring device, salt storage tanks, preheaters, and controls, and instrumentation.

That of the MSRE salt pumps, we plan to pursue the molten-salt bearing program vigorously. There is a need to establish whether such bearings can be used in a pump. In addition, the bearing materials may be applicable to the plugs and seats of valves for molten salt.

Bearing Materials - The Metals and Ceramics Division is preparing a program in which candidate bearing materials will be subjected to fuel and coolant salt tests. Hard-surface coatings on Hastelloy N substrate will be studied. The various methods that will be tried for applying the coating to the substrate include plasma spray.

Sixty-four hard-coated specimens consisting of plasma-sprayed cermet on Hastelloy N substrate were received from Mechanical Technology Incorporated. Four different coatings are represented: (1) tungsten carbide bonded with 7 to 10% cobalt, (2) 25% tungsten carbide—7% nickel—68% mixed W-Cr carbides, (3) 40% pure tungsten carbide—50% tungsten carbide with 12% cobalt binder—10% molybdenum, and (4) 75% chromium carbide—25% Ni-Cr alloy binder.

Of coating structure made before and after molten-salt tests; (4) surface roughness measurements taken before and after molten-salt tests; (5) determination of coating adherence to Hastelloy N substrate; and (6) metallographic studies. Coatings which have promise will be evaluated further in actual molten-salt bearing operation.

Bearing Tests. The materials that have sufficient promise will be fabricated into bearings and tested in molten salt. The first molten-salt tests will be conducted in an existing facility that can accommodate a 2-inch-diameter by 2-inch-long bearing. The facility was last operated with potassium, and its refurbishment to molten salt operation is being studied.

The layout of a facility for testing relatively large molten-salt bearings is complete. The facility utilizes such existing items from the MSRE pump program as the Mark 1 prototype pump tank and rotary element, the structure from the water pump test stand, and a high-temperature molten-salt drain tank. The tester will accommodate a 6-inch-diameter by 6-inch-long bearing and will be operable at speeds up to 1800 rpm, temperatures up to 1400°F, and bearing loads up to 500 lbs.

The tester will provide basic information and help resolve some of the problems of design, development, fabrication, and operation of molten salt bearings. The major of these problems is proof testing the selected bearing materials and their mounting arrangement should they have a coefficient of thermal expansion significantly different from that of Hastelloy N.

A cross-section of the tester is shown in Fig. 7.4. It consists of the aforementioned existing pump modified by removing the impeller, volute, and other structures inside the pump tank to make room for the test journal, bearing, and mount, and bearing loading device. The journal is attached to the end of the shaft by means of a conical mount that accommodates relative thermal expansion between these two pieces by sliding along the conical surfaces and at the same time maintains concentricity between the outside of the journal and the shaft centerline.

The bearing consists of four tilting pads mounted on a ring made of the same material as the pads. The ring, in turn, is mounted on a structure of leaf springs having radial flexibility sufficient to permit relative thermal expansion between the ring and structure without overstressing the members. The radial stiffness, however, is sufficiently high to transmit the bearing load easily. The bearing is loaded by means of a hydraulic cylinder acting on the lever that penetrates the tank through a bellows and bears against the leaf spring structure. The entire bearing assembly is supported on slender rods that permit the assembly to move with almost zero redundancy upon application of the bearing load. Lugs are provided to resist the bearing torque. The tester will be driven by a low-torque motor to reduce damage in the event of bearing seizure. We expect the bearing to operate predictably in molten salt, so no attempt will be made to measure such functional characteristics as operating clearance and attitude angle.

The tilting pad bearing configuration was selected for the tester because of its ability to better accommodate those conditions that cause bearing damage and lead subsequently to failure. Damage is most likely to result from (1) the presence of crud or particulate matter in the lubricating salt; (2) thermal distortion of the bearing surfaces or loss of the alignment between the journal and bearing; or (3) mechanical disturbance of the bearing surfaces caused by starting and stopping the journal. It can also tolerate a relatively high degree of misalignment.

A fundamental criterion in the design of a molten-salt breeder reactor is that maintenance will be done in a safe and economical manner. Attainment of this objective requires close surveillance of the reactor design during the conceptual stage so that considerations of the basic problems of component maintenance and replacement are included.

We are now establishing the broad outlines of the maintenance system design and development program.

The application of the portable maintenance shield concept to the MSBR is important in that this basic piece of equipment will be used for almost all remote maintenance operations. A practical, workable design must be achieved before we can confidently look at in-cell problems. The design must take into account the shield block layout, the method of gaining access through the containment, the layout of components in the cell, and any physical obstructions on the working floor level. Also of interest in this general area are experiments to be conducted to measure the residual radiation levels in the reactor cell of the MSRE.

We propose to use remote cutting and welding as the means for disconnecting the salt piping for component replacement and for gaining access into the reactor vessel for graphite moderator replacement. The early development of this capability is important in establishing the maintenance concept as well as in establishing the space requirements in the plant layout. Figure 7.5 shows schematically the equipment involved in the process for welding the horizontal piping.

The development effort will be primarily concerned with an assembly consisting of items 1 and 4 and the connecting cables. Activity thus far has been limited to generating broad outlines of the overall program and to a search for information on the state of the current technology. Significant and applicable work has been found in the area of automatic butt welding of pipes.

Installation and direct monitoring. These two firms are Liquid Carbonic Corporation of Chicago, Illinois, a subsidiary of General Dynamics Corporation, and North American Aviation, Inc. Both systems use tungsten inert-gas welding and a control system that operates on the usual welding parameters to achieve automatic welding. There are some differences in the detailed electrical and mechanical design, in their capabilities, and possibly in their state of perfection. While this equipment represents an advanced state of the art for automated welding, no existing system fully meets our specific requirement for remote welding.

Because of the large amount of radiation and contamination, item 4 presents the greatest problem. A number of methods are being evaluated that range from the use of a huge charge-discharge machine to a simple long-handled grapple approach. In handling the contaminated graphite, we have the option of breaking the moderator bars into smaller pieces and loading them into a transport cask below the reactor shield, or bringing them up into a container above the shield and disposing of them from there.

Analog computer studies of the dynamics of MSBR systems were initiated. These studies are anticipated to establish the foundation for determining a suitable control scheme, as well as the safety requirements of the plant. The primary approach is to initially simulate, in as much detail as feasible, the various individual subsystems to ascertain the behavior of these subsystems during postulated transient conditions. Subsequently, these studies will serve as the basis for assessing the validity of simpler models, enabling the simulation of the entire plant.

The term C(t – 7,) dictates the need for a transport lag generator for each delay group if they are to be faithfully simulated. Two such methods were compared: (1) the six groups were reduced to two effective groups by use of the and the two other delay groups were treated with the transport lag devices.

Preliminary studies of the dynamics of two-fluid MSBR were made to determine the initial reactor response to certain load and reactivity transients in the absence of any control action. The durations of some of the transients were short compared with the transit time of the salt in the fuel circulation loop and therefore yielded no significant information regarding overall stability.

Figure 8.1 shows the results of the simulation of the insertion of approximately 0.75% 5k/k as a step while the reactor was operating at the design point power level of 556 MW (thermal power of a single module of the four-module 1000 MW (electrical) two-fluid breeder plant). Although the power reached a peak value of about 775 MW in 0.375 sec, the fuel temperature at the core outlet only increased by about 30°F. After the initial peak, the power settled to about 625 MW, at which time the run was terminated since further changes would be at a rather modest rate, which we considered quite amenable to routine control measures.

Figure 8.2 shows the results of a run simulating the coastdown of fuel salt flow without changing coolant salt flow rate, again with initial conditions at the design point. The coastdown assumed was an exponential decay from 100 to 10% flow rate with a time constant of about 6 sec. In this case, the power decreased to approximately 12% in about 50 sec and then began to rise slowly as the effects of the excess cooling by the heat exchanger began to reduce the mean fuel temperature in the core. At this time, the temperature of the fuel leaving the core was about 1340°F and was rising at a rate of less than 1°F/sec.

Simulation of the entire plant will require additional analog computer equipment to simulate transport lags in the piping of the secondary salt loop. An order has been placed for two lag generators, with delivery expected around the middle of the 1968 calendar year.

The steam generator has been modeled for examination of its dynamic behavior on the analog. Considerable simplification of the system equations has been undertaken. Further, an attempt will be made to cause dynamic variations which are model-dependent rather than real to occur in times short compared with times of physical interest. We will do this by (1) forbidding unrealistically rapid adjustment of control devices and (2) possibly rescaling time. Such procedures are often used to adapt the computer to a problem which is actually beyond its nominal capability. We cannot.

It should be observed that this problem is nearly identical to a problem done by the British CEGB and Electronic Associates on a hybrid computer, and their experience demonstrates clearly the need for a machine with the capabilities of a hybrid computer to handle this problem properly. These results, unfortunately, are unavailable to us because of proprietary reasons.

The model itself has been linearized, a procedure we consider appropriate for control, if not for safety purposes. The heat transfer coefficient is now permitted to be a function of the velocity of both fluids. Analog controls are provided to permit variation of salt velocity, water pump speed indirectly affecting initial pressure, initial temperature, and throttle opening. The throttle is treated at all times as a critical aperture.

The chemical research and development effort in close support of the MSBR program includes, as described in this chapter, a variety of studies. A major share of this effort continues to be devoted to the immediate and anticipated problems of the operating Molten-Salt Reactor Experiment (MSRE).

The prospects for the application of fluoroborate coolants in molten-salt reactor technology continue to appear favorable and have justified a continuing investigation of the NaF-NaBF, and design increasingly favor the development of a single-fluid system. Efforts to devise efficient chemical reprocessing methods have become more significant. Laboratory studies of the recovery of protactinium and removal of lanthanide fission products from the core salt by reductive extraction into molten metals continue to show promise and are actively pursued.

Chemical behavior in the salt, gas, oil, and water systems of the MSRE has been the subject of a continuous surveillance program since the beginning of MSRE operations. Surveillance is accomplished partly by on-line instrumental analysis. The condition of salt systems, however, is.

Appraised preponderantly from the results of chemical analysis, numerous samples are obtained as part of this program. They afford a means for determining the stability and compatibility of salt-metal systems, the condition, and service life of coolants and lubricants.

Composition, purity, and oxidation-reduction potentials of the fuel salt; in addition, analyses of the fuel salt are performed regularly to measure the isotopic composition of the fissile material in order to compute fuel burnup rates. It has been the purpose of this program to apply the experience gained during the period when the MSRE contained 235y_238U fuel salt to the operation of the reactor in the near future with °5U fuel salt and subsequently to the design of molten-salt breeder reactors. Results of previous MSRE materials analyses were summarized in the last report of this series. In the intervening period, the MSRE has operated continuously for its longest period of power generation uninterrupted by drain and flush operations. This period of some 25,500 MWh has afforded an unprecedented opportunity to determine the extent to which a program of routine analyses is relevant to reactor operations.

It became evident at the onset of MSRE power operation that the online reactivity computation was about ten times as sensitive for detection of small changes in uranium concentration as individual chemical analyses of the fuel salt could be anticipated to be. Therefore, until more precise methods for the determination of uranium are developed, the chief function of individual analyses.

Routine MSRE operations alter the composition of the fuel salt principally by the consumption or addition of $^{5}$UF and by intermixing fuel and flush salts. 1. These results reinforce the prior inference that the circulating fuel salt would exhibit excellent chemical stability in nuclear operations and indicate that estimates of fuel composition, as computed from operation data, are in satisfactory agreement with analytical results. Final evaluation of operating power levels and residual reactivity depend upon such concurrence.

Statistical analyses of the chemically determined values for uranium concentration show that control limits have not been exceeded. However, within these limits, a disparity between computed and analytical values has developed, one in which the results of chemical analyses indicate that the concentration of uranium in the fuel salt is currently lower by ~0.02 wt% than that computed from operational data.

The nominal book value for uranium, as shown in the actual trend in these values, is more clearly evident from the control chart computed from a least-squares program using both weighted (where individual data points were assigned values of 4σ — dashed line; 0.2) and raw values (solid line; 0.2) of uranium concentration. The raw values indicate a difference in chemical and book value of 1.28 kg in total uranium. A similar disparity has also been noted in a gradual decline in the computed reactivity, which has been observed. It seems to have proceeded from the beginning of power operation, a decline which would account for an apparent difference of 0.95 kg in total.

We find no chemical basis for this unexplained difference between the anticipated values for uranium concentration of the fuel salt and the experimentally determined values. The reality of the difference seems to be unquestionable and is found in a corresponding magnitude in reactivity computations. We conclude, therefore, that it will be necessary to reevaluate the method by which the concentration of uranium in the fuel salt is computed.

The overall purity of the MSRE fuel salt, as judged from the concentrations of oxide and chromium, has been maintained during the present report period. An innovation was made in the method of handling samples of fuel salt obtained for oxide analysis or for measurement of the concentration of trivalent uranium in fuel salt. This heated carrier maintains the temperature of salt specimens after isolation at 200 to 300°C, ensuring that the fluorine recombination reaction can proceed sufficiently rapidly to prevent the evolution of free fluorine from frozen salt. This technique presumably obviates the possibility that nascent fluorine might remove oxide from the salt.

In previous power operations of the MSRE, the concentration of chromium in the fuel salt has remained constant during periods of salt circulation. After power was reduced from 7.2 to 5.0 MW and reactor outlet temperature from 654 to 638°C, we found that the chromium level of the fuel salt had risen to approximately 85 ppm.

It has been postulated that one of the principal reasons for the unexpectedly low values observed is that the metal surfaces of the fuel circuit have been covered with a film of the noble-metal fission products Nb, Mo, Tc, and Ru about 10 Å thick. Results of electron microprobe analysis of the metal surveillance specimens removed from the MSRE in May 1967 lend support to this view.

Product film and base metal alloy are unequal. Chromium from the freshly exposed alloy surface would then be available for reestablishment of its steady-state activity. If this sort of mechanism is indeed operative, similar behavior should occur.

The significance of the mechanism proposed here is that it requires assignment of previous changes in the chromium concentration of the fuel salt to the circuit system rather than to the drain tanks. If the total amount of chromium represented by this increase, +47 ppm from the outset of MSRE operations, were leached uniformly from the fuel circuit, it would correspond to removal of chromium from a depth of 0.283 mil, or to an average corrosion rate salt circulating in the fuel circuit.

We have obtained mass spectrometric analyses as part of a program of routine analysis of the MSRE fuel salt. Results of the isotopic analyses have been accumulated in order to evaluate the potential applications of such analyses to the computation of power generation in the MSRE. The results obtained from the beginning of power operations with the MSRE are summarized in. 3. The data shown here indicate moderately good correlation of the spectrochemical determination of 235U concentration with calculated values. The analytical results show a continuous average bias of +0.

Tc, Ru, Te, and Nb in the graphite core of an MSBR. Neutron economy would suffer if too large a fraction of these species, possessing moderate neutron cross sections, were deposited in the high-flux region. Information on the concentrations of fission products in MSRE fuel salt is of immediate interest in planning the volatility processing of the current charge of MSRE fuel salt.

In the current report period, tests similar to those previously carried out were continued, with emphasis on checking and improving the experimental techniques. In addition, several hot-cell tests were carried out on the nature of gas-borne activities above molten fuel salt samples from the MSRE. The following sections will report in some.

The possibility was suggested in the previous report that the occasional high values and wide scatter of measured concentrations of noble-metal activities in fuel salt samples may have been due to contamination of the ladle sampler by activities present in the pump bowl gas phase.

The evacuated 20-cc capsule was sealed by a fusible plug of Li, BeF, which melted when the capsule was lowered below the fuel level in the pump bowl; allowing the fuel salt to fill the evacuated capsule. The enclosed salt sample was thus protected from contamination from outside.

In the analytical hot cell, the end of the inlet capillary was plugged with wax, and the exterior of the capsule was leached with acid to remove contaminating activity. The salt, after powdering and mixing, and the interior leach were analyzed.

The results of the radiochemical analyses are reported in Table 10. 1, in which each value represents the sum of the activities found in the salt, the interior leach, and the capillary dissolution, and is reported in disintegrations per minute per gram of sample calculated back to the time of.

The concentrations of the fission products with stable fluorides (rare earths, alkalis, alkaline earths, and zirconium) were in satisfactory agreement with previous analyses of samples taken by the ladle method. However, the concentrations of the noble-metal fission products were at least an order of magnitude lower than in previous samples. In the first sample, FP14-20, the bulk of the noble metals in the total sample were found.

The drop of wax used to seal the tip before leaching the outside of the capsule. In subsequent samples, the outside of the capillary tip was sanded to remove adhering activity before applying the wax. Only a small fraction of all activities was then found in the capillary.

The leach of the interior of the emptied capsule usually contained an appreciable fraction of the total noble metal in the capsule, occasionally as much as half. Most or all of the OsNb was in this leach. It is therefore possible.

A long capillary with a salt seal at its tip needs to be submerged in the fuel salt, or the salt seal can be made of a high-melting salt like LiF, allowing the capsule exterior to saturate with noble metals before the sealing salt dissolves.

Deposition on the capsule exterior probably does not deplete the salt sampled of noble metals by more than a factor of 2, except in the case of ^{55}Nb. However, it leads to another analytical difficulty which may help to explain the considerable scatter of the noble-metal data in Table 10.1. The exterior of the capsule is leached repeatedly with 2 N HNO3 at 85 to 95°C until the last leach contains less than 1% of the gamma activity of the first leach. Noble metals, however, tend to replate on nickel from the leaching solution. Normally, 15 to 20 leaches are required to reach the 1% level. Since the noble-metal concentrations inside the capsule are very low, a slight remaining contamination of the exterior might account for much of the activity found in the inside leach. On this basis, the lower figures in Table 10.1 are probably more nearly correct.

In any case, the scatter of the noble-metal concentrations in the fuel salt samples is of little practical consequence since the values are so small, representing on average less than 1% of the quantities that would have been found if none had left the salt phase. By contrast, the fission products with stable fluorides show concentrations within 30% of their calculated values, although the scatter exceeds the claimed 20% analytical accuracy.

In summary, it is felt that the estimates of noble metal concentrations in fuel salt are much more reliable from freeze-valve capsule samples than from ladled samples. Previously reported data should be discounted.

The analyses of seven gas samples taken in the mist shield region of the MSRE pump bowl by the freeze-valve capsule technique have been thoroughly discussed in previous reports. The results indicated that a small amount of fuel salt mist and an appreciable share of the total noble-metal nuclides produced by fission were, by some mechanism, injected into the cover gas phase (see Table 10. 3). Uranium concentrations in the gas samples were usually higher than those calculated from the amounts of salt mist indicated by Zr.

Tests in which small metal specimens were exposed to the gas phase and fuel phase in the pump bowl gave the first qualitative indications of unusual volatilization and plating behavior of the noble-metal fission products. High concentrations of noble-metal activities were found on specimens exposed to cover gas or fuel, while fission products possessing stable fluorides showed much lower activities. Results have been reported previously from a large number of tests run with several types of metal specimens (Hastelloy N, Ag).

Ni, Au, and stainless steel under a variety of reactor operating conditions and exposure times. The results of these tests were disappointing from the standpoints of obtaining quantitative information and of showing variations in deposition under different test conditions. The reproducibility of results was poor, with variations between duplicate runs often as high as an order of magnitude. Deposition on the different metals was not significantly different. Exposure time had little effect; samples exposed for 1 min collected as much activity as those exposed for 10 min. Even samples exposed several hours after stopping the fuel pump or two days after draining the fuel out of the reactor showed as much deposition of noble metals as normal samples. The addition of beryllium to reduce the fuel caused no significant change in deposition.

In the current report period, efforts were concentrated on trying to identify the experimental factors causing difficulty. Comparative runs were made in which the specimens (Ag, Hastelloy N, and stainless steel) were fluorinated, hydrogenated, or left in the normal slightly oxidized condition. Exposure times were 1 and 10 min. The six tests gave practically indistinguishable results. Deposition of noble metals was approximately halved on the fluorinated specimens compared with the others, but this small difference is probably not.

The last two tests identified the basic difficulty. In the first of these, the metal specimens were lowered in the sampling pipe to a position 2 ft above the pump bowl. During the 10-min exposure, the usual helium flow of 200 cc/min was passed down the tube. The test assembly was then withdrawn and packaged for shipment to the analytical laboratory in the usual way. Approximately the same amounts of noble-metal nuclides were deposited on the test specimens as in normal exposures in the pump bowl.

The second test consisted of hanging a standard test assembly on the cable latch, leaving it there for one day as in the customary test procedure, removing it with the sampling cubicle manipulator, and packaging it for shipment and analysis in the usual way. Again, the amounts of noble-metal activities found on the specimens were nearly as great (within a factor of 1 to 10) as in a normal pump.

Clearly, the contamination of the samples during the various manipulations involved in the test procedure, before or after the actual pump bowl exposure, was responsible for most of the observed activities. This difficulty was not identified sooner because of the astonishing reproducibility of the contamination. Variations of several orders of magnitude would be expected rather than the observed zero to one order. This uniformity suggests that most of the contamination may have occurred while the test assembly remained for a day on the latch in the highly contaminated 1C area.

These observations make it necessary to discard any quantitative interpretation of the pump bowl exposure tests. The source of the contamination is still principally the gas phase above the fuel in the pump bowl, so that the qualitative conclusion that noble-metal activities predominate in this gas remains valid. Also, the conclusions from test FP11-50, in which graphite and metal specimens were at least partially protected from contamination by a perforated metal screen, probably remain sound. These observations on contamination confirm the explanation given for the high concentrations of noble-metal fission products in fuel salt sampled by the open ladle technique.

In a previous report, a summary was presented of the more significant results from the examinations and analyses of the graphite and Hastelloy specimens which were exposed to fissioning molten salt for 24,000 MWh in axial positions in the MSRE core. Since then, the analyses have been completed, and the middle graphite bar (Y-7) was also sampled by a different method and analyzed for a few isotopes with a germanium diode gamma spectrometer. The same specimen was also examined with an electron probe in an attempt to detect surface contamination and by proton bombardment to determine the concentration profiles of lithium and fluorine. The significance of these additional results will be briefly discussed.

The 147Nd, the 11Ag profile behaved like 107Ru; the activity dropped steeply through four orders of magnitude in 10 mils. The 137Cs behaved in an unusual manner, as it also did in the 7800-MWh exposure. Its activity dropped two orders of magnitude in 10 mils and then began slowly rising. It has been suggested that both these species can diffuse in graphite. The 147Nd, 144Ce, and 141Ce exhibited fairly straight plots of the logarithm of the activity vs penetration distance, and the slopes were each quite similar to that for 140Ba. This behavior does not agree with the theory that the slope should vary inversely with the half-life of the rare gas precursor. The half-lives are very short, less than 1 sec, 1. 7 sec, and 16 sec, respectively, for the precursors of 147Nd, 144Ce, 141Ce, and 149Ba. Yttrium-91, with a 10-sec krypton precursor, gives a slope less steep than 140Ba.

With its very short-lived xenon precursor, it is puzzling how 147Nd got into the graphite at all. From the fact that the three rare earths had similar concentration gradients, it may be guessed that they entered and diffused in the graphite as rare earths rather than as xenons.

For each of the species which gave straight plots of log activity vs. distance, the slopes were steeper for the top graphite sample than for the sample in the middle of the core, although the graphite types were supposedly identical. Both of these samples showed distinctly steeper slopes than the bottom sample, which was of the more porous "lattice stock" variety.

The concentration profile plots revealed an interesting indication of the difference in permeability of the same piece of graphite from different sides.

It was very disturbing that analyses of the blanks sometimes showed more activity (particularly for 2°Mo, 93Ru, 19°6Ru, and 95Nb) than the irradiated sample just previously milled. Confidence was destroyed in all analyses giving lesser values than the blanks. Nevertheless, these analyses behaved in a very consistent manner, resulting in smooth.

To check the validity of the sampling method, a remaining stored piece of the irradiated middle graphite bar (Y-7) was handled by a sanding method that permitted sampling from the inside out. The graphite tailed off toward the center of the specimen in a manner very similar to that observed with the milled specimens. Absolute comparisons between the two sets of data usually agreed to within better than an order of magnitude. Since the area of graphite sampled by the two methods differed by a factor of about 30, local variations in graphite density and permeability might explain the difference in results.

The results of the sanding method restored much of our confidence in the milling method of sampling. Certainly, the reality of the tails of the concentration profiles was established. The simplest explanation of the high blanks is that the blank graphite specimen somehow became contaminated inside the hot cells where the milling was done.

Electron Probe Examination. A small sample of the irradiated middle bar graphite (Y-7) was mounted for electron probe examination for possible identification of any surface deposits. The sample was shipped to the Argonne National Laboratory where an instrument for examining radioactive samples was available. The electron probe examination, which could be used to within 1 or 2 microns of the edge of the graphite, detected no impurities. Typical detection limits were 0. 02 wt% for tellurium, and 0. 04 wt% for uranium and technetium.

Lithium and Fluorine Concentration Profiles in Irradiated Graphite. A proton bombardment method for determining the concentration profiles of lithium and fluorine in irradiated graphite is described. The study indicated that the molar concentration of lithium exceeds that of fluorine at all points inside the graphite.

Fission Product Distribution in the MSRE - Results have been reported above for the quantities of fission products in the fuel salt and in the cover gas of the MSRE. In addition, the total inventory of each nuclide at this date is available from a recently developed computer program for calculating the total amount of each isotope from the operating history of the MSRE. An approximate material balance for May 8, 1967, based on these data is given in Table 10. 3. It differs from the balance given in the previous report because of the revised concentrations of noble metals in the fuel salt.

To enter the cover gas data into a material balance, the quantity of each species lost per day (observed concentration times volume of cover gas flow per day) must be compared with the production of that species by fission per day. As discussed in the previous report, it is likely that the gaseous concentrations measured in the mist shield region are higher (by a small factor) than those in the bulk of the cover gas. This will tend to yield high material balances for species like 90Mo, whose concentration in the gas phase.

It has been established that the gas phase above the fuel in the MSRE pump bowl contains appreciable concentrations of fission products, particularly the noble metals. However, no hard information exists regarding the chemical and physical nature of the volatilized species and the mechanism of volatilization.

First and Second Hot-Cell Tests. The experimental plan was originally designed to distinguish between the volatile fluoride and metallic colloid hypotheses on the nature of the volatilizing species. We planned to measure the activities in the gas phase above the surface of molten MSRE salt when (1) pure helium was slowly passed over the quiescent surface, (2) a mixture of 5% H2 in helium was similarly passed, (3) pure helium was bubbled through the salt, and (4) the H2-He mix.

Two hot-cell experiments of this type have been carried out: one with a sample of MSRE salt 35 days old, and one on the day after sampling. The 50-g salt sample was contained in a flanged, gas-tight stainless steel reaction vessel, fitted with a gas inlet tube through which a dip tube line could also be inserted, and a large tube through which the probe tubes were inserted to within 1 inch of the molten-salt surface. A side tube from the large tube provided an alternate path for gas flow. The gas inlet tube and the alternate line were connected to valves on a simple gas manifold carrying two other valves, which were connected to a vacuum pump and to the gas supply.

The tank helium was purified by two titanium sponge traps at 600°C: one near the tank outside the cell and the other just before entering the gas manifold. The second titanium trap was added after the first test showed signs of fuel hydrolysis.

To avoid exposure of the fuel salt sample to air as much as possible, the top of the usual 50-gram sampling capsule was cut off just above the salt level, and the capsule was placed in the flanged reaction vessel without fracturing the solidified lump of salt. A sheathed Chromel-Alumel thermocouple wired to the reaction vessel was used to indicate and control the furnace temperature. During the evacuation, every joint in the system was leak tested with acetone and a Hastings gauge. When no more leaks could be detected.

The reactor was then heated to 600°C; the cap was removed, and the probe tube was quickly inserted. The Swagelok fitting on the probe tube had previously been attached at a level such that the lower end of the probe was within 1 in. of the molten-salt surface. The only exit for the helium flow was up through the probe tube, so all the gas sampled passed within 1 in. Because of the resistance to flow of the Feltmetal filter in the probe tube (Fig. 10. 2), the system pressure usually rose to 2 to 3 psig at a helium flow of 10 to 15 cc/min. In the first run, with 35-day-old salt, the flow was continued for 1 hr. In the second run, the duration of flow was decreased to 30 to 40 min.

The first probe tube was then removed, and the large tube was capped loosely. The titanium traps were cooled, and the 5% H2—95% He mixture was passed through the system to flush out the pure helium. The flow of gas was adjusted at 10 to 15 cc/min, and the second probe was inserted, run for 1 hr, and removed. With the large tube capped, a Swagelok union on the gas inlet line was opened, and the dip line was placed in position so that its end was about 3.5 in. below the melt surface. The alternate line was open during this operation to provide flushing flow over the salt. With the gas inlet line attached to the dip line, the cap on the large line was slightly opened, the alternate line valve was closed, and a bubbling flow of 5% H2—95% He was started at 10 to 15 cc/min. The third probe was then inserted, run for 1 hr, and removed.

In the first run, the pressure in the reactor was released at the end of the bubbling tests by loosening the Swagelok fitting on the probe. This required all the gas in the long line to the outside manifold to bubble rapidly through the dip tube as the pressure decreased to atmospheric. It is estimated that the bubbling flow was about 200 cc/min for 2 min at the end of these tests. In the second run, it was realized that the pressure across the dip tube could be equalized by opening the valve on the alternate line. By this means, the pressure was relieved without a sudden violent bubbling through the dip tube.

At the bottom, a 0. 5-inch-thick Feltmetal filter (100% retention of particles larger than 4 µm), and 1-inch-long sections filled with NaF and soda-lime pellets. In the analytical hot cell, the ends of each tube were plugged with small rubber stoppers, and the outside surface was leached with acid until the last leach contained less than 1% of the gamma activity of the first leach. The tubes were then cut into a bottom section, a Feltmetal section, an NaF section, and a soda-lime section. Each sample was separately dissolved, and the solution was analyzed for 12 fission products and 235U.

The analytical results of these tests are given. Scans of the samples from the first test showed that the predominant activity was 1511. This behavior was undoubtedly due to fuel salt hydrolysis, indicating some water impurity in the reaction vessel atmosphere. However, the salt surface appeared green and scum-free after both tests, so the degree of hydrolysis could not have been excessive in the first test. Since a 35-day-old sample was used in the first test, the short-lived 9Mo and 132Te activities could not be detected in many of the samples. Even where values are reported, they are not reliable.

The results of these tests are very instructive, in spite of the wide scatter in results within each run and between runs. The following comments apply to both tests but more specifically to the second test, whose results showed less scatter. With gas passing slowly over the quiescent molten fuel surface, appreciable quantities of all the major fission products were found inside the probes, with the noble metals predominating as in analyses of MSRE cover gas. There was no difference in volatilization behavior when H₂ was added to the sweep gas. If the noble metals had been present as high-valent fluorides, they should have been reduced to nonvolatile states by H₂. Thus, the noble metals are probably present in the gas phase as a colloidal suspension of tiny metallic particles. The presence of activities such as Sr⁹⁰ (proportions found in fuel salt) inside the probes.

Showed that the fuel salt was also present in the gas phase as a colloidal mist. Simple vaporization of fuel salt could not account for either the quantities or the relative proportions of the activities found in the probes. This observation has disturbing implications regarding the proposed distillation separation of fission products from the bulk components of fuel salt since appreciable quantities of fuel salt would volatilize as mist as well.

For each nuclide, the quantities deposited in the bottom empty section of the probe and on the filter section were similar, more so for the second test. About 10% of these quantities were usually found in the NaF and soda-lime sections beyond the filter.

When helium or 5% H2—95% He was bubbled slowly through the melt (second test), the amounts of activities found in the various sections of the probes were very similar to the amounts when the gases slowly passed over the melt. Thus, the gas phase above the melt appears to be as easily "saturated with the colloidal suspensions by the quiescent surface as by slow bubbling. This observation is contradicted by a laboratory mockup experiment in which the slow bubbling of helium through molten Li,BeF2 produced visible droplets of salt on a horizontal metal plate 1 cm above the salt surface. However, when the gases were bubbled rapidly through the melt for 2 min at about 200 cc/min (first test), the amounts of all activities in all sections of the probes increased by factors of 10 to 1000 compared with the slow-flow cases. Therefore, the amount of fume or mist formation is greatly enhanced by turbulence.

The readiness with which gaseous suspensions of noble metals and of fuel salt are formed above the highly radioactive fuel melt invalidated the original presumption that only fission products with volatile fluorides could leave the melt under the gentle sweep conditions. However, the evidence from the hydrogen gentle sweep runs and particularly from the hydrogen bubbling run in the second test is nearly incontrovertible that volatile fluorides are not involved in a significant way in causing the noble-metal fission products to become gas-borne. A second line of argument.

To the same effect may be based on the demonstrated readiness of fuel salt particles to become suspended in the gas phase. If the fuel salt so easily becomes gas-borne, the same should be true of noble-metal particles in the fuel. To account for the preferential volatilization of noble metals, it may be necessary to postulate that the colloidal particles are concentrated at the salt-gas interface.

Although the hot-cell tests provide strong evidence as to the nature of the gas-borne activities, the question of mechanism remains unanswered. The formation of gaseous colloids from the quiescent molten surface may not be explained by normal physical processes. One possibility is that recoils from beta emissions near the surface of the molten salt may cause the ejection of tiny particles of fuel salt and of noble metals into the adjacent gas phase. Another suggestion is that differences in thermodynamic contact potentials between metals, salt, and the gas phase would tend to eject metal particles from the salt phase into the gas phase.

Third Hot-Cell Test. A third hot-cell test was designed to: (1) confirm previous results using similar probes; (2) determine whether the suspended metal or fuel particles in the gas phase were electrically charged; (3) attempt to determine the size of the particulates in the gas phase by examining with an electron microscope a filter through which the exit gas was passed; (4) test the diffusion behavior of the gaseous activities by observing the distribution of activities deposited on the inside of a 4-inch-diameter vertical tube whose open end was near the fuel surface and whose top end was closed; and (5) obtain an indication of particle size distribution in the gas above molten fuel by passing the gas through a long copper tube and measuring the distribution of activities down the length of the tube. It was also intended to carry out several of these tests at intervals over the course of a month to determine the effect of activity decay on the volatilization process. However, the furnace used to heat the reaction vessel.

Fourth Hot-Cell Test. The burned-out furnace in the hot cell was replaced, and a fourth hot-cell test was started with a fresh 50-g sample of MSRE fuel salt, FP14-69. Due to experimental difficulties and an intervening weekend, the first two runs of this test were carried out five days after the salt was sampled. The sample was kept at 200°C during this period to avoid radiolysis.

The first run contained a probe tube of the usual type and two electrodes for measurement of the charge on the particulate matter in the gas phase above the molten fuel. This test will not be described in detail since analytical results are not.

The copper screens were of the type used to hold electron microscope specimens and had previously been coated with a thin (600-A) vaporized layer of carbon. The gas exiting from the reactor passed at 15 cc/min for 40 minutes through a 4-inch-diameter tube which surrounded the rod holding the screens. With this experimental arrangement, the exiting gas traversed the screens at a linear velocity of about 0.5 cm/sec, with a good opportunity for the particulate matter to deposit on the screens.

The 4-inch-diameter tube and the stainless steel rod were then removed from their reactor, and the six copper screens were carefully loosened from the rod and dropped into small plastic bottles. Through the plastic bottle, no sample read more than 300 mr/hr of gamma activity, so that the screens could be examined in the electron microscope in Building 3019. Gamma scans of the five lower samples showed high 151I activities (~10 dis/min per sample) which masked the probable presence of other gamma activities. The 151I contamination of the topmost sixth sample was lower (4.6 x 10^5 dis/min), so that the presence of 99Mo (3.1 x 10^5 dis/min), and 140La (5.9 x 10^4 dis/min) could be detected. These activity readings were taken 7.0 days after the salt was sampled.

At this writing, the three topmost copper screens have been examined in the electron microscope. A sizable quantity of particulate matter was observed on the screens, often covering several percent of the areas viewed. There appeared to be three discrete particle size ranges: very fine particles 35 to 180 Å in diameter, medium-size particles 1000 to 2000 Å in diameter, and occasional large particles more than ten times larger than the medium-size particles (0. 4).

A curious circular pattern of particles was often seen, particularly on the two topmost screens. An exact circle was outlined by medium-sized particles. The interior of the circle was filled with randomly deposited medium and fine particles.

At high magnification, it can be seen that many of the medium-sized particles are transparent. It is possible that the fine particles are deposited on top of the larger particles, but most of the larger spots are pale gray compared with the darker color of the small particles.

To patterns obtained when small droplets of solution evaporate on a flat surface. It is possible that MSRE fuel salt particles on the screens may pick up atmospheric moisture over the course of several days' exposure to air before examination. The most abundant phase in the fuel salt, Li 2BeF2, is known to be deliquescent. The solution so formed could spread over the carbon film to a thin layer. When this film is evacuated and heated by the electron beam, the water could evaporate and form the characteristic circular patterns. Close examination of. 6 shows that many of the smaller spots are also pale in color. These may represent only partial solution. The darker spots with no pale areas may be materials which do not. An electron diffraction pattern is shown of the material in the area in the light square of. 8. This type of pattern is characteristic of salts (like the fuel salt) but is not the type of pattern obtained from graphite or metals. The diffraction pattern identifies part of the volatilizing material as a salt, probably fuel salt.

The observations reported are of considerable significance since they represent the first hard direct evidence that colloidal particles are to be found in gas sweeping slowly by the surface of MSRE fuel salt. In addition, we now have some idea of the particle sizes we are dealing with. Most of them are extremely small—of a size which could well be ejected into the gas phase by beta recoil. It will be desirable to expose some of the electron microscope screens in the MSRE pump bowl gas space and in the access tube as soon as possible. Plans have already been made to expose some in the MSRE off-gas line.

The MSRE pump bowl suggests that the noble-metal fission products may be highly concentrated at the fuel-gas interface and may even be incorporated in any surface scum or foam floating on the salt. There is basic and practical interest in finding an answer to this question. Considerable thought has been given to the experimental problem of sampling the fuel surface itself. The two major problems are contamination of the sample by the gas phase (or by deposition from the fuel phase) and dilution of the sample by salt from below the surface. Several rather elaborate devices have been designed but have not yet been.

By accident, we may have obtained a good surface salt sample by a method which would be difficult to duplicate intentionally. Sample FP14-60 was to have been a 50 g sample for the third hot cell test. It was taken in the usual large nickel capsule with windows near the top to admit the salt. When the sample arrived at the hot cell, it was found that the capsule contained only 5 g of salt. Although the normal 50 g sampling procedure was used, it appears that the bottom of the capsule windows must have been exactly at the fuel salt level. If it had been higher, no salt would have entered the capsule; if it had been lower, the capsule would have filled completely. It is likely that the ripples in the fuel surface occasionally lapped a little salt into the capsule.

Unfortunately, the capsule must have been contaminated inside and out with noble metals from the gas phase and on the outside by deposition from the fuel melt. Since the sample was therefore not an ideal one, it was decided to handle it by the procedure used for ladled 10-g samples and to compare the results with those from ladled 10-g samples.

Deposition of Noble Metals on Nickel from Cover Gas and from Fuel Salt. In a number of previous pump bowl tests, the deposition of noble metals on the stainless steel cables used to suspend fuel sampling capsules was examined to determine whether deposition was greater at the fuel-gas interface than in the cover gas or in the fuel. While there was much scatter in these data, the deposition on the interface region was usually higher (by a small factor) than on the higher or lower regions. In an earlier section, it was pointed out that this type of observation was made uncertain by the contamination problem.

In a special test with an unrelated objective, FP14-55, a nickel rod inside a perforated nickel basket was lowered into the pump bowl so that the middle of the rod was at the level of the fuel salt surface. This provided a sample of metal exposed to the interface region in a container which offered some protection against contamination.

Cell microscope. The activity on each section was leached off, and the leaches were analyzed radiochemically. The gas-phase and interface regions showed very similar depositions of noble metals. The deposition of noble metals on the liquid-phase region was higher by factors of 30. Since the deposition was so disparate between gas- and fuel-exposed regions, the deposition on the interface sample should have been heavily weighted by the portion of this sample which was submerged in fuel. The results suggest that the visual determination of the fuel-gas interface position on the rod was at fault. The difference in surface appearance (drop-shaped watermarks and a dark deposit) that was taken to indicate the salt level may actually have represented a region well above the salt level. In this case, the results given represent merely the difference in deposition from the gas phase and from the fuel phase.

In a previous report, determinations of fission product distribution in MSRE surveillance specimens after 24,000 MWhr were reported. Samples were obtained by milling off layers of the graphite surfaces in a plane parallel to the longitudinal. Powder was dissolved and analyzed radiochemically for selected fission products. Near the surface, layers as thin as 1 mil were milled off as samples; subsequent samples at greater depths were as thick as 10 mils. Generally, a total depth of about 50 mils was sampled from the four sides of each specimen. The following inherent uncertainties in this sampling procedure were recognized: (1) some contamination was certainly carried by the steel milling surfaces to the next.

In order to determine if the tails or concentrations of fission products observed at considerable depth in the specimens were real, the following sampling scheme was devised. The rectangular-shaped specimen was sawed longitudinally. It was then drilled from the cold inner (new) surface to the outer (hot) surface. The hot surface of this small graphite core was glued to a cold graphite coupon, which in turn was glued to a precision-ground tool steel piston. The piston fits into a dial-indicating micrometer allowing reading changes in the piston vertical position to direct readings of 0. 1 mil. The samples are obtained by describing a figure-eight motion on a clean surface of emery paper resting on a precision lapping plate. The resulting powder is taped in place on the emery paper. This procedure, first devised by Lonsdale and Graves, has been detailed in K. Lonsdale and J. N. Graves, Diffusion of Thorium in Pyrolytic Carbon Coatings, pp. 18-35 in Coated Particle Fuels Research at General Atomic.

Described in detail elsewhere. We believe that the use of this apparatus certainly eliminates the uncertainties described above for the milling operation type of samples. The weak point in this procedure for these surveillance specimens is that only a small portion of the specimens is sampled when compared with milling samples.

The taped-on samples are transferred to a gamma-ray spectrometer for determinations of fission product concentrations. This approach to the problem was begun at a time when the surveillance samples had cooled beyond determination of short-lived isotopes of Mo, Te, I, and Ba.

The first core-drill sample was taken from the portion of specimen Y-7 from which some 60 mills of the surface under consideration had been removed earlier by milling. Small samples (1 to 10 mils) were removed from this core by grinding, starting at the cold (midplane of the specimen) end. These samples were counted using an NaI crystal that had only sufficient resolution to allow good counting data for 95Zr, 137Cs, and 144Ce. (For subsequent samples, a germanium diode was available, thus allowing greater resolution and determination of more nuclides. ) Part of the data obtained from these grinding samples is reported from the original surface, was obtained from a sample taken 10 mils deep from the surface left following the milling. From this depth (10 mils) on to the "new surface," the concentrations of the three nuclides dropped, as much as an order of magnitude. We have no explanation for this anomaly. However, it is clear that the tails observed from the milling-type samples are real since we see measurable concentrations extending to the midplane in Table 10.6.

To check the possibility that zirconium was produced in situ from uranium contained in the graphite before its exposure to the salt, a corresponding piece of unirradiated material was subjected to activation analysis. Analysis showed the natural uranium content of the specimen to be less than 0. 06 ppm, whereas about 70 ppm would be required to yield the amount of zirconium-5 found at about 100 to 125 mils from the original surface.

Next, a core (305 mils in diameter) was drilled through a portion of the Y-7 sample which had not been milled. Initially, 251 mils were removed from the 467-mil-thick specimen in the following increments: one 2-mil sample, nine 1-mil each, five 5 mils each, five 10 mils each, one 15 mils, two 25 mils each, and two 50 mils each. At a later date, the remaining 216 mils were sampled by grinding ten increments 1 mil each, five 5 mils each, five 10 mils each, three 25 mils each, and one 56-mil portion. Partial results of the gamma-spectrometer counting data are shown in Figs. The core surface represented by the left ordinate in each figure is that surface which was exposed directly to free-flowing fuel salt in the reactor, and that the surface represented by the right.

Coordinates were exposed only to stagnant fuel salt, which found its way through slits available where adjacent pieces of graphite were stacked together. However, this portion of Y-7 was left unmarked when stored since it was intended for permeability studies. From these curves and data not shown representing sampling to the midplane of the core, we observe the following: In. 10, the 95Nb follows a similar pattern from one surface to the other, ending at the back (or stagnant) surface at a greater concentration by a factor of about 15 to 20. The 95Zr concentration gradient is considerably steeper on the back side of the specimen, with no detectable amount between 15 and 85 mils.

Explain the marked differences in penetration in graphite as shown in Fig. 11. The melting point of barium is 725°C, and the operating temperature of the graphite is believed to be 650 to 750°C. If the ordinates in Fig. 10. 4 and 10. 114 represent a graphite surface exposed to stagnant fuel salt, then the higher surface concentrations and lesser depth of penetration for several of the nuclides may have occurred as follows. If this surface had contact only with a limited amount of salt for a long period of reactor operation, then penetration by any nuclide observed, except Cs-137, which probably penetrated from the opposite surface, would be limited by fission products available. However, at the end of reactor operation, barren salt circulated through the reactor for a very short time (relatively) did not have sufficient contacting time with this surface to remove fission products as thoroughly as at the opposite free-flowing salt.

In Table 10. 7, details are given of the distribution of seven nuclides starting from the graphite surface in contact with free-flowing salt and extending to a depth where ~100% of all nuclides have been found. These data are presented in tabular form, corresponding to the data represented graphically in Figs. previously reported by Kirslis. The data were obtained using quite different techniques and analytical procedures. It is interesting to compare the results, as shown in Table 10. 8. While there are apparent differences in results from the two methods, it appears likely that the method we have described, that is, grinding of a small graphite core and dry graphite powder gamma spectrometry, yields usable results. The small core samples, of course, have the distinct possibility of including a crack, which could markedly affect the results.

In Table 10. 9, the data for the total atoms of individual nuclides, surface to midplane, are given for the second sampling (representing the first half of this graphite core) and the third sampling (representing the second half). We see that with the exception of the large difference for Z= Nb, the total nuclide contents of the opposite halves of the core are very nearly the same.

Another (the third) core was drilled from specimen Y-7. It was sampled by grinding throughout its entire length of 470 mils. Table 10. 10 shows a comparison of total atoms of each nuclide per square centimeter of graphite surface from one surface through to the opposite surface for the second and third cores. Reasonable agreement is found for six of the seven nuclides; the discrepancy for 141Ce between the two comes about because of low concentrations found in the first 10 mils of the third core. Table 10.

By the hand grinding of small cores from graphite surveillance specimens, we can expect to obtain representative results for the distribution of fission products in the specimen. Short-cooled specimens of graphite from the MSRE may prove too radioactive for hand grinding, and methods of performing this operation remotely are being investigated. The attractive features of this method include savings by direct gamma spectrometry of the graphite powder rather than dissolution of the much larger milling samples and the necessary radiochemical separations of each nuclide. The grinding procedure has also allowed determinations of Li and F on each freshly exposed surface.

Consideration of the proton-induced reactions TLi(p,n) and F(p,α) suggested that they might be used to measure the concentration of these target nuclides in graphite as a means to determine the extent to which MSR fuel salt components penetrate into the graphite under irradiation. Heretofore, none of the standard analytical techniques, including neutron activation, has shown much promise for this application at the few ppm.

Profile curves are similar in shape for both cores, with slightly steeper slopes for the third core curves. No detectable amount beyond 150 mils from the first surface of the third core is found all the way from the first surface of the second core.

For 7Li, the high neutron yield and relatively low cross-section (0. 33 mil) do not produce any Li(p,n) reaction threshold of the 7Li(p,n) reaction (1. 881 MeV), offering neutrons at greater depths. The major neutron back a unique identification with high sensitivity. The ground (mostly from cosmic rays) can be conveniently determined by a companion bombardment. The Be(p,n) threshold occurs at 2.059 MeV, and the tons of 2.06 MeV penetrating the surface of graphite lose energy by Coulomb interaction with the a 6.14-MeV gamma ray with a very high yield.

Fission products. The reaction has recently been used to study fluorine penetration of Zircaloy by Starfelt et al.

Protons at 1.88 MeV from the ORNL 3-MV Van de Graaff were collimated to a 0.32-cm-diameter spot. Steady currents from 4 to 1 year were collected at the sample and integrated to monitor the number. A scintillation counter was placed 4 to 225 cm from the sample to record the gamma-ray spectrum.

The thin standards used were 180 g/cm² and about 14 pg/cm² of LiF evaporated on aluminum. A thick LiF crystal was used as a standard also, after evaporating a thin conductive layer of silver on three of its faces to avoid electrostatic problems from the proton charge buildup. Possible bias in our calibration for fluorine concentrations is estimated at 10% to allow for the effect of anisotropic emission of gamma rays near 90°. For lithium concentration, the uncertainty is 20%, largely because we could not use 1/r scaling to greatly reduce the dead-time corrections (due to a high count rate) in counting the standard. In the case of the MSRE sample (Y-7) mounted on an iron cylinder for lapping, an additional large correction for neutron transmission through the iron raises the possible bias for lithium to 25%.

Three samples of graphite were studied. A piece of clean graphite gave the background spectrum indicated in Fig. 14. A comparison with the standards indicated that a fluorine concentration of about 1 ppm could be detected in a 10-min run. The lithium detection limit with the neutron counter used was about 0.1 ppm.

A sample of graphite (Y-5, grade CGB, bar 635) exposed to nonradioactive molten salt for nine months was studied, as well as one from the MSRE (Y-7, withdrawn in May 1967). Successive surface layers of these samples were ground (lapped) away to measure the fluorine concentration at successive, deeper levels. Since the back face of sample Y-7 had also been exposed to the molten salt, concentrations were studied as this face was approached from the interior of the sample. The removed material is to be analyzed for fission products and uranium.

The sample exposed to nonradioactive MSRE fuel salt (Y-5) showed surface contamination of 1.1 pg/cm². This was removed by a 5 x 10^74 cm lapping. Since the proton beam is capable of evaporating or sputtering surface layers, the sample was bombarded for more than 2 hours with a %-pa beam before lapping. The fluorine contamination of the surface was decreased by about 5%. Discrimination between thin surface layers and material distributed in depth was accomplished by varying the proton.

Energy. Figure 10. 15 shows the concentrations of lithium and fluorine found at depth in sample Y-5. The initial very high lithium value near the surface did not persist in the further measurements and is not considered typical of the bulk graphite. It may represent material originally in a small fissure about 8 x 10 cm deep.

The MSRE moderator sample (Y-7) showed about 3 r/hr (surface) fission product activity, requiring special handling. A 1.8 cm lead filter was used in front of the spectrometer to reduce the overall counting rate from the radioactivity. To determine whether this fluorine concentration was due to salt penetration of a crack fortuitously crossing the sample, a microscopic examination and an acetone test were performed. Neither test showed any evidence of a crack. Incipient cracks have normally led to fracture during the coring procedure used in cutting the sample from a larger piece of graphite. Sample Y-7 showed no fractures in the section we studied.

The sample exposed at the center of the reactor for nine months (Y-7) shows over 100 times the lithium and fluorine content found in the control sample (Y-5) given identical treatment except for irradiation. Since graphite is expected to withstand up to 20 times heavier irradiations before replacement for structural reasons, it will be important to study penetration after a longer reactor.

In the unirradiated sample, the ratio of lithium to fluorine (~0.43) is probably consistent with that expected for the 7LiF molecule (7/19) in view of possible errors in normalization. The ratio expected from the fuel salt composition is%. The nonstoichiometric ratios found, particularly in the irradiated sample, seem suggestive of ionic diffusion.

The fluorine concentration in the irradiated sample (Y-7, 0.16) follows the inverse of the depth from the front or back face fairly closely, although the anomaly near 0. 008 cm (3 mils) from the rear face seems real. The anomaly is also seen in the lithium data, 0. 17, and may correspond to an inhomogeneity in the graphite.

The lithium concentration in the irradiated sample is not proportional to the fluorine, rising from the 7/19 ratio typical of LiF near the surface to 6/1 at the center. Only the molten-salt flow velocity was reportedly much different at the two faces.

The possibility that colloids or metallic sols are involved in the corrosion product and fission product behavior in the MSRE fuel has led to a study of colloids in molten salts. When the MSRE fuel was initially treated with hydrogen and beryllium during purification, sols, as well as larger particles of reduced nickel and iron, were evidently produced. Some of these have remained suspended throughout the operation of the reactor and presumably constitute the iron and nickel content regularly.

Reported in fuel analyses. Also, since beryllium treatments in the reactor did not decrease the chromium concentration, part of the chromium in the fuel is presumably present as a metallic sol. In general, the sols would be expected to exist as alloys rather than as pure metals.

The more noble of the fission product metals, because of the reduction potential reflected by the UF content, are expected to exist in the MSRE as elemental metals. Most of such elements plate out on walls as metal (or possibly as carbides on graphite, in the case of molybdenum and niobium). An appreciable portion also appears to leave with the off-gas. However, to the extent that they do remain in the fuel, they are probably present as sols.

There is a marked tendency for flotation to occur. We studied samples from a fuel solvent melt to which large amounts of structural metal fluorides had been added and then reduced with hydrogen and zirconium. On melting a coarsely ground portion of this material in glass, a dark scum accumulated on the surface of the quiescent melt. When the scum was removed and discarded, the remaining salt had a decreased structural metal content. The results are shown in Table 10 and 12.

Fluorine concentrations in the graphite reactor were monitored for nine months. Measurements were taken as the sample was ground away in layers, progressing from the first surface to the center (open circles), and then from the interior toward the second surface (closed triangles). The distances indicated are measured from the nearest surface exposed to molten salts.

The significance of the different symbols is as described for 0. 16. The distribution does not appear to be symmetrical, and a nonuniformity near 0. 008 cm from the second surface is suggested. The fluorine measurement (0. 16) indicates a similar minimum. There was a possibility that the black material included finely divided ZrO2, the oxide that precipitates from fuel solvent. Since there was no significant segregation of zirconium, we concluded that flotation had removed predominantly. The conditions for the formation of a similar scum at the liquid surface of the pump bowl in the MSRE are good. However, attempts to detect it directly have been inconclusively unsuccessful. Most of the material collected in the laboratory experiments on flotation seems to be larger than colloidal in size (>0. 1), but the sol particles are probably behaving in the same manner as the larger the interface. Another suggestion is that recoil is responsible. Bursting bubbles may have an effect, but the results of hot-cell tests (see Sect. 10. 1) with quiescent fuel from the MSRE suggest that bubbles may not be necessary. There is evidence that sol particles escape from radioactive MSRE fuel to form an aerosol is that because the gas above radioactive fuel is conducting, a contact potential between the liquid salt and gas phases impels charged particles from.

The whole question of the formation and stability of colloids in molten salts has been virtually untouched in the literature. Accordingly, experiments in nitrate melts have been initiated (because of the convenience of working with nitrates) to characterize such colloidal behavior.

Colloidal dispersions of silver metal in molten potassium-sodium nitrate eutectic have been prepared by UV photolysis. Colloidal gold has been prepared in sodium-lithium and sodium-potassium nitrates by reduction of gold chloride and also by supersonic dispersion of particulate gold.

Another surface-related behavior that has been studied is foam formation. Foam formation in nitrate melts was induced by adding aluminum nitrate nonahydrate. The foam was first formed by bubbles of nitrogen oxide from the decomposition of aluminum nitrate. When helium was bubbled through the melt, the nitric oxide foam gave way to a helium bubble foam, which, if undisturbed, lasted for about 15 min. Similar behavior was encountered some time ago on an addition of thorium fluoride to a nitrate-fluoride melt. In both cases, we could hypothesize that the foam was stabilized by finely divided oxide. In view of the rare occurrence of molten-salt foams, we have conjectured that a finely divided wetted solid may be a requisite for stable foam formation in molten salts.

The first step in the synthesis involved forming a solution of MoF₂ and MoF₆ by reacting molybdenum metal with an excess of MoF gas to be fluxed in a Pyrex container, such as that shown on the right in Fig. 11. 1. Commercial MoF₆ was purified with respect to HF before use by distilling it over NaF in an apparatus similar to that shown on the left in Fig. 11. 1. Hydrogen fluoride is known to catalyze the removal of HF, resulting in several explosive ruptures of the Pyrex equipment, while, in the absence of HF, the MoF₆ was contained for weeks without an observable pressure increase. As much of the apparatus as possible was flamed under vacuum before use because these fluorides are very reactive toward moisture. After the molybdenum metal was completely reacted with the excess MoF₂, the system was evacuated, and the temperature slowly increased. During this procedure, the excess MoF₂.

Upon further heating, part of the MoF6 sublimed to the neck of the Pyrex flasks, and part disproportionated, producing MoF5 and MoF4 (which then left the system). Experiments in which the terminal temperatures were 200° and 150° both produced MoF5 as a tan residue in the bulb and MoF4 as a bright yellow deposit in the neck of the flask. The ratio of MoF5 to MoF4 was higher at 200° than at 150°. An experiment which was heated to only 100° produced the MoF4 in the neck of the container but left a viscous residue with a molybdenum-to-fluorine ratio slightly higher than MoF5. This residue did not solidify upon cooling to room temperature and storing for several days.

The MoF and NbF were both identified by X-ray for MoF, were identical to those obtained by structure studies. The pattern for MoF corresponds to that calculated from structural data in the literature. The analytical results confirming the stoichiometry are shown in Table 11.2. The impurity levels determined by emission spectroscopy are also shown in Table 11. 2. The optical properties of these substances and of NbF° were determined to provide a rapid and convenient means.

The absorption spectrum of MoF is being investigated. Preliminary results show absorption in the region of 1260 nm and an intense ultraviolet shoulder near 340 nm. The relative stability of MoF at temperatures of reactor operation and the fact that it can produce both molybdenum metal and volatile molybdenum products upon disproportionation suggested that the behavior of Mo in MSRE-type solvents should be investigated. Examination of quenched melts.

Long to the system LiF-MoF. Their optical properties and x-ray diffraction patterns have been determined and are given in Tables 11. 4 and 11. 5, respectively. Attempts to determine the stoichiometry and melting behavior of these phases have been complicated by corrosion of container materials such as nickel and copper. However, the formulas are certainly close to SLiF-2MoF and LiF-MoF. The compounds have been so labeled, continuing with the following goals in mind.

Table 11.4, Optical Properties of the Lithium MSRE, and that its kinetic behavior should be Fluoromolybdates quantitatively investigated in the ppm range. Initial conditions were selected to provide a LiF-MoF; Uniaxial positive simple reference system, which could be made N = 1.512 progressively more complex and more analogous j = 1.524 to the MSRE. The first experiment was made with N = 1.472 helium flow rate of 8 liters/hr per kilogram of No = 1.490 melt. The MoF was added to the molten 2LiF.

Raised to 700°C, in this case, there was a definite decrease in the molybdenum concentration in the filtered samples. The unfiltered samples contained more molybdenum than the filtered ones, suggesting that metallic molybdenum was present and that it was being excluded by the filter. The copper analyses do not appear to have a trend with time. The scatter of the wet copper analyses was greater than expected from the analytical procedure and is probably an artifact of the sampling technique, which involves a copper filter.

The effect of the helium flow rate (MoF, removed rate) on the kinetic behavior of Mo in molten 2LiF-BeF2 was investigated in runs 3 and 4. The data in Table 11.7 and 12 indicate that the molybdenum was removed from the 2LiF-BeF2 by a second-order process, the most likely event being.

If one makes the steady-state assumptions for reaction (1) that the concentration of MoF was constant and very low compared with the concentration of Mo, then k takes the form af/(b + df), where a is the rate constant for the forward reaction, and b is the rate constant for the back reaction.

The first two points (at 0 and 0.75 hr) in Fig. 11.2 are associated with a lower temperature since the heat-up from 500 to 700°C was involved. However, since the rates were faster at the lower temperatures, and since the rates are known to increase with temperature, the short-term effect must have another explanation. Apparently, this was the period necessary to establish the steady-state condition. These kinetic experiments will be continued with the following objectives.

The mass spectrometric study of molybdenum fluoride vaporization behavior was continued. Previous work was conducted with a conventional Knudsen cell suitable for the study of low-vapor-pressure solids. This cell was not suitable for the study of gaseous species at elevated temperature. Accordingly, a cell (made of nickel) was constructed, which permitted the addition of gases directly into the cell region. Using the new cell, the mass spectrum due to the admitted MoF was obtained.

The rather striking similarity of results from the MoF and the MoF studies is shown in Fig. 3, which displays the derived percentages of the species MoF, MoF, and MoF2 as a function of temperature for both the tri- and hexafluoride. The data for MoF2 exclude the dimer. The difference in free energy of formation between MoF2 and MoF3 is clearly very slight since their relative amount varies only slowly with temperature. The earlier conclusion that kinetic factors dominate the descriptive chemistry of these materials is still valid, although we have obtained data indicating.

The dimer MoF2 was not the only dinuclear fluoride observed. During admission of MoF6, an erosion of the tantalum heat shields in the Knudsen cell assembly occurred and was evidenced by the presence of MoTaF4 ions in the spectrum, as well as by subsequent examination of the tantalum.

Continued work on the molybdenum fluoride system will include a more complete treatment of the data obtained so far and consideration of the approach needed to obtain the desired thermochemical and kinetic data for this system. Some other fission product fluoride and oxyfluoride systems will also be examined.

Because spectrophotometry offers a direct measurement of fission products such as the lower-valent niobium and molybdenum fluorides, a study has the advantage that the melt need only be exposed to a container which has been selected on the basis of the melt's reactivity with it. For this reason, graphite and copper windowless cells have been selected for use with MoF2 and NbF4 solutes in LiF-BeF2 (66-34 mole %).

Successful dissolution of MoF in L. B. has been achieved by first treating the solvent with SiF4 and filtering it through a quartz frit. The spectra of such solutions display peaks at 350 and 470 nm, which are not inconsistent with those expected for a d° cation in octahedral symmetry. To verify that this spectrum is not due to contributions from SiF4, it was compared with one produced by a sample taken from the molybdenum fluoride kinetic studies of C. F. Weaver and H. A. Friedman.

Yielded only a very weak spectrum; similar absorbances at 350 and 470 nm could be identified. The poor intensity of this spectrum has been tentatively attributed to the fact that much MoF had precipitated out due to oxide contamination of the sample. Experiments are currently underway to demonstrate this further as well as to establish a quantitative value for the absorption coefficients at 350 and 470 nm. With these values, limits of spectroscopic detectability will be available. Further experiments will be made in an attempt to demonstrate conclusively that the spectrum is due to dissolved MoF in octahedral.

Niobium tetrafluoride is apparently sparingly soluble in L. B. Presently, only a very weak spectrum has been obtained, which displays a single absorbance at 350 nm. This spectrum is, however, similar to that produced by NbF3 in molten NbF5. Further work shall endeavor to circumvent the solvation problems by generation.

Additional information available from the spectroscopic studies includes the compatibility of the solutions with the container materials. In reactor-grade graphite, the spectrum attributed to MoF disappears completely within 4 hours at 650°C according to first-order kinetics. No intermediate spectra have been seen during this reaction. On the basis that the same solution shows no perceptible change under similar conditions in a hydrogen-fired copper container, reaction with the graphite is suggested.

Niobium pentafluoride has been the most convenient starting point for the synthesis of lower niobium fluorides as well as a low-temperature solvent for the lower niobium fluorides. It had been previously prepared in a flow system at 250°C by passing fluorine over niobium powder in a Monel reaction vessel, but this procedure would have taken several days of reaction time for the hundred-gram quantities of product required.

It was found in this work that decreasing the reaction temperature accelerated the reaction rate to the point that it could be completed within 8 hours. This is to be expected for an exothermic reaction, which involves a decrease in the entropy of the.

The synthesis was performed in a two-chamber Monel reaction tube, which was entirely sealed except for the F2 inlet valve. The F2 was admitted at a constant rate into the reaction chamber containing powdered niobium metal at 70 to 100°C, and the NbF5 sublimed into the other chamber, which was at room temperature.

Activity coefficients could be derived for BeF2 (and by a Gibbs-Duhem integration for LiF). Usefully accurate measurements could not be made with pure BeF2 in the cell because of its very high viscosity; hence, values of E° were calculated using values.

In a silica cell. The purpose of these experiments is (1) to develop lithium-bismuth alloy electrodes containing about 0. 1 at. (At very much higher lithium concentrations in bismuth, that is, with saturated alloys, there have been indications of the dissolution of reduced bismuth species in LiCl-LiF mixtures).

In a preliminary experiment, 41 g (1. 2 moles) of LiF-BeF2 (66-34 mole %), which had previously been purified for use with the MSRE, was electrolyzed under a helium blanket between a bismuth cathode (99. 999% Bi, hydrogen fired at 600°C to reduce any oxide) and a graphite anode isolated from the main portion of the melt in a silica J-tube. Forty-one grams of bismuth were used as the cathode, and the temperature was 473°C. Approximately 160 coulombs were passed (~1. 7 x 10^4 equivalent), enough to produce about 0. 8 at. % lithium-bismuth alloy if the current efficiency were 100%. The current density was 2 x 10^-3 amp/cm. The silica cell permitted visual observation of the melt and electrodes during the electrolysis. From the inception of electrolysis, gas bubbles were formed at the cathode (possibly hydrogen from the reduction of residual HF, which had been used in the purification of the salt, or traces of OH^-).

Covered the surface of the bismuth cathode. Chemical analysis of the phases has not been completed, but it is believed that the black deposit was metallic beryllium. Because of the low rate of diffusion of lithium from the surface into the bulk of the bismuth, the local activity of lithium at the surface may have been high enough to permit beryllium, which is insoluble in bismuth, to deposit on the surface.

Samples of salt were withdrawn for analysis after passing about 40 coulombs and again after about 160 coulombs (equivalent to about 0. 2 and 0. 8 at%, respectively, lithium in bismuth). Preliminary analytical results showed that the bismuth content of the salt samples was below the limit of detection of 10 ppm. There was no visible attack of the silica by the metal phase. Experiments are continuing to evaluate the behavior of the lithium-bismuth electrodes and to elucidate the electrochemical behavior of bismuth in molten fluorides.

Because of the high specific conductance of most molten salts (1 to 6 ohms·cm), one of two experimental approaches is usually employed: the use of capillary-containing cells, which results in a measured resistance of several hundred ohms, or the use of metallic cells in which the container is one electrode with a second electrode positioned in the melt. Measured resistances in the latter type of cells are less than 1 ohm. Boron nitride encased in graphite has been successfully employed in capillary construction, while platinum, platinum-rhodium (20%), Inconel, molybdenum, and graphite have been used for container and electrode materials.

The practice of measuring resistance at a series of frequencies and extrapolating to infinite frequency as a function of \( f^{-1} \) is examined in terms of electrode process concepts. Some authors followed this procedure, while others found no appreciable variation of resistance with frequency. Unfortunately, the majority of investigators did not address themselves to this question. Research on the frequency dispersion of electrical conductivity in molten salts is continuing in this laboratory.

The silica cell shown in Fig. 4 was designed for use in the determination of electrical conductance in molten LiF-BeF2 (66-34 mole %). The small-diameter tubing increased the conduction path and resulted in measured resistances of the order of 100 ohms. A Wheatstone bridge incorporating a variable resistance and capacitance connected in series was constructed, and its use eliminated errors resulting from approximations often employed in conductivity measurements. The platinized platinum electrodes (diameter 1 mm) were held in a fixed position relative to the cell assembly by glass tape.

The frequency dependence of the measured resistance of LiF-BeF2 (66-34 mole %) is shown in Figure 6 at several temperatures. The specific conductivity, calculated from the values of resistance at infinite frequency and Eq. (1), is presented in Figure 7 as a function of temperature. From the slope of this line, the temperature coefficient at 500°C is calculated to be 3.9 x 10-2 (°C)-1.

The molar conductance at 500°C is 25.5 cm ohms per mole. The measurements were completed during the first hour the cell was in contact with the molten fluoride, and we believe the accuracy to be better than +10%. In a subsequent experiment.

Value of resistance extrapolated to infinite frequency also varied (0.9). This cannot be explained in terms of changes in cell constant, since (1/a) was redetermined at the completion of the experiment to be 171 cm. Investigation of the frequency dependence of measured resistance.

In the past, gas sparging, stirring, and rocking have been used to provide agitation in studies of heterogeneous equilibria involving molten fluorides. The stirred vessels, while providing the most vigorous mixing, tended to leak at the seal of the stirrer shaft. A rocking furnace or gas sparging did not provide very vigorous agitation.

More recently, the need for an improved reaction vessel became urgent in connection with the planned study of the distribution of U, Th, and Pa between fluoride and oxide phases. The attractiveness of such an extraction system as a protactinium recovery process obviously depends as much on favorable equilibration rates as on favorable equilibrium behavior. But to achieve good extraction rates, one needs good suspension and mixing of the heavy oxide solids with the fluoride salt; this requires a suitably designed mixer.

Gas maintained at ~0.4 atm (gauge) is circulated continuously through the melt and then around a closed circuit, which includes an infrared gas absorption cell. Measurement of the infrared absorption bands of SiF is used to monitor the course of the reaction. The growth of the CO absorption peak also provides a sensitive measure of the rate of oxygen inleakage, since CO is produced by the reaction of oxygen with the traces of graphite present in the melt.

With the stirrer-shaft seal lubricated by a small amount of oil, the stirrer has been operated continuously at >300 rpm for several days at a time. While wear of the Teflon rings requires an occasional tightening of the packing nut, the outleakage of helium is easily maintained below ~1 cm Hg of pressure per day, while the rate of air inleakage, as indicated by the CO₂ content of the cover gas, has been nearly undetectable.

Generally, the levels of oxide ions are low, and the oxide ions produced by this reaction can easily be kept at low levels if SiF4 is introduced into the cover gas. In visual experiments and in spectrophotometric studies, silica containers were found to remain intact and did not contaminate the melt, provided the SiF4 generated was retained in the cover gas or if SiF4 was already present in the cover gas. The chemistry of SiO2 in the presence of MSR fluoride mixtures is being studied further with the objectives of (1) establishing the equilibrium solids which can coexist with such melts and (2) examining their ion exchange properties.

If the above reaction is allowed to proceed to the right by sweeping away the SiF4 produced, the oxide ion concentration should increase until a new oxide-containing solid phase precipitates. Beryllium oxide is normally the oxide phase which first precipitates in molten Li, BeF2; but according to the SiO2-BeO phase diagram, SiO2 should react with BeO to produce Be2SiO4 (phenacite).

This equilibrium has been investigated directly by the recirculation of helium carrier gas through a Li, BeF2 melt to which both SiO2 and Be2SiO4 had been added, and then through an infrared absorption cell where the intensity of the SiF4 peak at 1033 cm⁻¹ was determined. The gas was pumped around this circuit by means of a finger pump.

The observed partial pressures are, in general. At present, a stirred vessel is being used in continuing these measurements.

Two distinct advantages are gained if an electrochemical cell can be constructed from fused silica rather than from graphite or corrosion-resistant metals. First, fused silica provides excellent electrical insulation for the electrodes; and second, the cell components are visible so that the formation of gas bubbles, solids, etc. , may be detected rapidly. Even so, fused silica has seldom been used with fused fluorides in the past because of the corrosive attack of the fluoride salt on the silica. Recently, however, Bamberger et al. suggested that the presence of an SiF4-containing atmosphere would reduce the rate of attack of some molten fluorides on fused silica. This protection of the silica should be the greatest with those fluoride salts which have a relatively low basicity or alkali fluoride activity, for example, LiF-BeF2 mixtures that contain 0. 33 or higher mole fraction of BeF2.

The design is such that it will permit, in a single system with a controlled atmosphere, both equilibrium and nonequilibrium electrochemical measurements, including emf, chronopotentiometry, linear sweep voltammetry at fixed solid or liquid electrodes, rotating disk voltammetry, and polarography at a dropping (bismuth) electrode. The purpose of these measurements is to yield information about the diffusion coefficients, decomposition potentials, and oxidation states of the species dissolved in the molten salt.

A nickel head having eight ports, which terminate in Swagelok fittings, provides entry to the cell. Five ports are vertically aligned risers. Three of these risers are used for entry by electrodes. A fourth riser is used either for solid sample additions or for a fourth electrode. The fifth riser admits either a stirrer or a rotating disk electrode through a Swagelok tee fitted with Teflon seals. Helium pressure is maintained through the tee to provide an inert-gas seal. The remaining three ports are for a thermocouple well, and inlet and outlet gas lines.

In the summer of 1965, we decided to establish a Molten-Salt Chemistry Information Center. The primary purpose was to provide a detailed subject index to all the chemical material representing ORNL work in the field since 1950. A secondary purpose was to provide a framework into which other technical reports and open-literature publications could be inserted. The center has never been formally funded but has required approximately half the time of one technical man and half the time of one secretary. Because of the low level of funding available and the purposes of the center, we designed it so that it could be used by technical staff members without assistance and so that new entries could be created with the minimum investment of technical time.

The two most important functions, from the technical point of view, in establishing an information center for the retrieval of the information contained within are the selection of an adequate list of keywords for indexing purposes and the assignment of these keywords to particular documents or portions of documents. We have tried to use care in the selection of our keyword list and have, so far, limited it to 480 terms. The list is broken into two parts: general terms and materials. General people selected these keywords, and technical people have made the assignments of keywords.

Clerical and secretarial people have handled all the other aspects of entering the information into the system. A 5 by 8 card is typed containing the assigned serial number, the identification of the document, the abstract (if available), and the assigned keywords. Then the Termatrex cards for the several selected keywords are assembled and punched with the serial number. (The arrangement of the serial number punches is on a 100 by 100 grid, so that any number up to 10,000 can be located by a separate hole).

Each week, their current scientific literature is scanned for articles written by any of 106 source authors whom we have chosen as publishing wholly or significantly in the molten-salt field.

At the present time, the system has accumulated a total of 6,600 entries. The rate of accumulation has been somewhat more rapid than we had expected, particularly in view of the low level of effort which we have assigned to the work. The system has been most useful to new members of our staff in permitting their ready access to the earlier project work in the Molten-Salt Reactor Program. Additional support, which would be expected to materialize with an increase in the overall program, would permit us to expand our coverage of both the report literature and the open literature through systematic surveying of Chemical Abstracts and Nuclear Science Abstracts for relevant documents. When the storage capacity of the present system, 10,000, is reached, we can set up a second deck of Termatrex cards and continue with another 10,000 entries, or we can consider whether we have arrived at the stage of justifying the staff and complexity required to put the information into a digital computer data processing system. This operation would be essentially nontechnical since the system was designed with this ultimate conversion in mind.

The flexibility of the system permits continuous improvement of the indexing and easy correction of any errors that are found. For the present, it seems preferable to maintain the center as a device for retrieval of requested information rather than as a place for continuing analytical reviews with a regular output to customers. We can answer some telephone queries quickly and can handle some requests from outside writers for specific information, but we do not have the staff to do elaborate state-of-the-art studies at this time.

Studies of the reductive extraction of protactinium, uranium, and rare earths from molten fluoride mixtures into molten bismuth have continued to yield results that favor its application for reprocessing fissile and fertile mixtures of the two-region molten-salt breeder reactor concept. As previously reported in this series, the experimental data relate to the equilibrium distribution of extracted metals to concentrations of the reducing agent dissolved in the metal phase and permit the construction of an electromotive series where the relative positions of metals indicate their order of extraction. These values have demonstrated the chemical feasibility.

Breeder reactor within a reasonable degree of confidence and have provided a basis for initiating an engineering evaluation of the processing concept. More recent efforts have been primarily oriented toward reprocessing requirements of the conceptual single-region breeder reactor. This concept combines both fissile and fertile material in a single fluoride mixture which will nominally contain 12 mole % ThF4 and 0. 3 mole % UF6 dissolved in an LiF-BeF2 solvent mixture.

Combinations of elements with similar reduction potentials. Earlier data for a somewhat different solvent, LiF-BeF2-ThF4 (73-2-25 mol%), indicate that uranium will have to be removed as the first step, with protactinium following under slightly stronger reduction conditions. If the separation factor (about 10) obtained from these data is valid for the single-region system, the process of separating uranium from protactinium should be feasible but will require more careful process control. Further studies of the extractability of these elements in the single-region fuel mixture are in progress.

Fission product removal will logically be performed on the salt stream effluent from the uranium-protactinium removal unit ahead of the fuel reconstitution section of the reprocessing plant. Consequently, laboratory studies are concerned with the extraction of rare earths from a mixture of LiF, BeF2, and ThF4, where the concentration of thorium will be about 12 mole%, lithium may be varied from 58 to 72 mole%, and beryllium will make up the balance. In a preliminary experiment, a small quantity of ThF4 was added to LiF-BeF2 (66-34 mole%) containing about 100 ppm europium spiked with 152-154Fy activity. Extraction from this salt mixture (salt A) into bismuth was carried out as in previous experiments by making metallic lithium additions to the metal phase and by monitoring the progress with a beryllium electrode. Reduction potentials calculated from the measured distributions are shown as part of Table 13. 1, which contains current values for several elements obtained from the same salt mixture. If the thorium activity remains equal to its concentration, then at 12 mole% ThF4 in the single-region fuel mixture, thorium bismuthide will precipitate at -1.49 V. The distributions of various important elements between salt A and bismuth at 600°C are illustrated in Figure 13.1.

Functions of reduction potentials: The vertical lines mean that a solid phase of constant composition is being formed and will limit the reduction potential of the system until its concentration in the salt phase is exhausted. The important considerations for the single-region MSBR reprocessing scheme are the voltage difference between uranium and protactinium and the rare-earth positions relative to the vertical thorium line. If these values are valid, the extraction process should be feasible but not as favorable as its application with the two-region reactor.

Because of the uncertainty of thorium activity at higher thorium concentrations in the salt mixture and its effect on the extraction process, a systematic investigation of rare-earth extraction from salt mixtures of practical interest as a fuel solvent has been initiated. Since increasing the LiF concentration of the mixture, hence increasing its efficiency.

Studies have held the thorium concentration of the salt at 12 mole % and varied the ratio of lithium to beryllium. Three experiments with europium, samarium, and neodymium, each dissolved in LiFBeF27ThF4 (58-30-12 mole %), were conducted by adding thorium metal to the bismuth pool. Thorium saturation in bismuth was inferred when the potential of a beryllium electrode inserted in the salt mixture stopped falling upon further addition of thorium metal. The amount of extracted rare earth in each case was too low for quantitative evaluation under analytical conditions imposed on the system. Radiochemical analyses were further complicated by the presence of gamma-emitting thorium daughters, some of which extracted readily into bismuth. Neodymium was seen in the bismuth at 700.

800°C, but samarium, though it should extract more easily, was not definitely detected, probably because it has only a weak and short-lived radioisotope. Potentiometric readings in this salt mixture did indicate changes in the activities of the major salt constituents from values reported for salt A. Values for beryllium and thorium were found about 0. 1 and 0.05 V, respectively, more noble than in salt A if lithium is assumed unchanged.

Since the feasibility of the extraction process depends on the relative extractability of rare earths compared with thorium, the experimental procedures are being refined to yield significant values for very low extraction efficiencies. If we define this.

Values appreciably above 1 will denote feasible separations, and the magnitude of a will indicate extraction efficiency. Thus, if the concentration of rare earth in the salt mixture is 100 ppm by weight, the thorium concentration in the salt is 12 mole %, and the limiting potential corresponds to the bismuth, then the experimental procedure should detect rare-earth concentrations as low as 0.8 ppm in the bismuth phase. Experiments are now in progress to examine the effects of salt composition on the extractability of rare earths. These experiments will be conducted with cerium because of the convenient radiochemical properties of the 144Ce isotope for analytical application. When the salt composition has been optimized, extractions of the various important rare earths will be studied. The results of one experiment (still in progress) with the salt mixture LiF-BeF2-ThF4 (72-16-12 mole %) have shown the favorable extraction of cerium into bismuth at 600°C. Figure 13.2 illustrates the dependence of rare-earth extraction on the thorium concentration in bismuth up to its saturation value. The decrease in a with increasing thorium results from the higher valence of thorium than.

Current plans for the MSRE call for substituting 2331J for 735 in the reactor fuel mixture. The fuel solvent mixture, LiF-BeF2 (65-30-5 mole %), together with its fission product inventory, will be retained. This will be accomplished by fluorinating the fuel salt to remove its present uranium content and by adding 233U as the concentrate mixture LiFUF4 (73-27 mole %). During fluorination, the salt will become contaminated with fluorides of nickel, iron, and chromium as a result of corrosion of the Hastelloy N-fluorinator. Although the expected concentrations of these fluorides will not exceed their.

Solubilities in the fuel salt, their return to the reactor, are undesirable. Therefore, the reduction of structural metals from solution in the fluorinated fuel solvent and their removal by filtration from the solvent during its transfer to the reactor system are requirements of the refueling operation. An experimental simulation of these steps has been conducted to define better the feasibility of the refueling procedure.

The experimental program was carried out with a 104-kg batch of the fluoride mixture LiF-BeF2-ZrF4 (65-30-5 mole %), prepared from the component fluoride salts by routine production procedures. In order to represent conditions expected after fluorination of the MSRE fuel salt, approximately 80 g of CrF3, 50 g of FeF2, and 800 g of NiF2 were added to the salt mixture, which was hydrofluorinated for 6 hr with 10 to 20 mole % HF in helium to ensure complete dissolution of the corrosion product fluorides. The analysis of a filtered salt sample taken after the hydrofluorination period is compared with the expected concentrations in Table 13.2.

Easily, FeF2 with difficulty, and CrF, to a negligible extent, in a practical time period. The aim of the first part of the experiment was to demonstrate NiF reduction with a hydrogen sparge and to compare hydrogen utilization with that predicted from equilibrium data. After the initial hydrofluorination, free HF was stripped from the salt mixture by helium sparging, and the molten salt was sparged for 9 hr with hydrogen at a rate of 10 standard liters per minute at 650°C. The 48.2-liter salt mixture was contained in a 12-in. -diam vessel, and the sparge line terminated 26 in below the melt surface. The gas effluent from the treatment vessel was analyzed.

Periodically for HF (0.4), and sparging was discontinued when the HF concentration decreased to a low but near-constant value. The quantity of HF produced during this period was equivalent to about 93% of the NiF2 initially present in the salt mixture. Hydrogen utilization was considerably lower than would have resulted if equilibrium had been achieved. Under equilibrium conditions, a sparge time of 20.

Since equilibrium data predict very low hydrogen utilization during the reduction of FeF2 and CrF3, data were obtained on the reduction of these fluorides with zirconium metal. The zirconium was first machined to increase the surface area and thereby reduce passivation of the surface by the deposition of reduced iron and chromium. The turnings were pressed into ½-inch-diameter cylinders (ρ = 4. 6 g/cm³) having lengths of 0.3 to 1.0 inches to facilitate addition to the treatment vessel. The pressed zirconium slugs were added to the salt mixture after the reduction of NiF2 with hydrogen sparging. After each addition, the approximate extent of reduction was noted by sparging the melt with hydrogen and analyzing the effluent gas for HF. As shown in Fig.

HF concentration decreased steadily, and an arbitrary endpoint for the reduction reaction was established at a concentration of 0. 02 meq of HF per liter of H, as a result of experience during preparation of the initial MSRE fuel carrier salt. The calculated quantity of zirconium required to complete the reduction of the corrosion product fluorides was 115 g. This was based on the analysis of the salt mixture shown in Table 13. 2 and assumed reduction of 12. 2 equivalents of these metal fluorides during the hydrogen reduction period. Analyses of filtered samples taken near the conclusion of the zirconium addition period are shown.

The reduction of structural metal corrosion products from solution in the MSRE fuel solvent is anticipated to produce approximately 330 g (0. 73 lb) of solid particles per cubic foot of salt mixture. The suspension or entrainment of a major fraction of these solids during the transfer of the fuel solvent back to the reactor drain tank assembly could have adverse effects on filter performance. Therefore, the primary purpose of this program was an examination of salt filtration characteristics under conditions that would reasonably simulate those anticipated in the reactor application. Filtration tests were separately conducted on a sintered nickel product of the Micro Metallics Corporation, having pores about 40 μ in diameter, and two grades of Feltmetal, a product of Huyck Metals Company. Each filter was fabricated as a 25-inch-diameter plate so that geometric surface areas of all filters would be identical. One grade was of Monel with pores 20 μ in diameter and a second of 347 stainless steel having 41-μ-diameter pores. The latter, designated FM250 by the manufacturer, had a porosity of 78% and a rated capability for removing 98% of all particles over 10 μ in diameter. This material was chosen for application in the reactor system because of its adaptability to fabrication requirements and its satisfactory performance during these filtrations.

The credibility of the multiple filtration tests that were performed on a single salt preparation is based on the anticipation that the primary process for removing solids from the MSRE fuel solvent will be that of decantation. This conclusion is supported by considerable experience in filtering fluoride mixtures through sintered nickel during the production of fluoride mixtures for the MSRP. Examinations of filters used in this process have consistently shown the collection of very small quantities of solids on the filter plates. Thus, the novel feature of these current filtration tests is, perhaps, the indirect estimate of the particle size distribution of solids formed by the reduction process proposed for the reactor application.

The experimental assembly used for the filtration tests was essentially that used for the routine production of fluoride mixtures. The salt preparation vessel was connected by a 1-inch-diameter Inconel tube to a heated salt receiver vessel. The porous metal filter was mounted vertically in the transfer line above the receiver vessel. These lines were used alternately for forcing the 1.7 ft of salt mixture from one vessel to the other and were capped when not in use. This arrangement permitted repeated filtration tests to be conducted on the salt mixture. Eight filtrations were conducted during this investigation.

Although conditions that would promote the decantation process are desired for the reactor application, attempts were made also to observe filter loading capacities. Tests under static conditions prevailed when the melt had remained quiescent for a minimum time of 4 hours prior to transfer. Agitated melt conditions were established by rapidly sparging the melt with helium just before salt transfer. The temperature of the melt was controlled at 650°C (1200°F) for all tests. The indicated temperatures of the salt transfer line fell to about 565°C (1050°F) during the extended transfer operations. Lower temperatures were erroneously recorded from thermocouples that became separated from the transfer line. In no instances did the salt freeze in the transfer line or filter during the tests.

In each test, salt transfer was induced by increasing to 11 psig the pressure of helium above the salt mixture in the treatment vessel and evacuating all gases from the receiver vessel. These conditions were maintained throughout each test. The pressure drop across the filter varied as the level of salt in the treatment vessel decreased. A summary of the filter performance tests is shown in Table 13. 3. The 20-1 Feltmetal was tested first, and it was disqualified after 2 hr of operation. Essentially no salt was passed through the filter during this period. Inspection of the filter also showed that the predominant part of the 22-g holdup was salt, and only a thin layer of metallic material was on the filter plate. The second test, with sintered nickel, showed remarkable performance but collected only 7 g of material on the filter plate. The balance of the filtration tests showed comparable results which were essentially independent of the static or agitated condition of the melt. Under the test conditions, filtration times for FM250 Feltmetal were about 1.19 and 1.36 hr per cubic foot of salt mixture.

Filter plate after tests 4, 6, and 7. The results of chemical analyses of these samples are shown in Table 13. 4. Although test 6 resulted in a filter rupture, corresponding chemical analyses do not reflect excessively large concentrations of structural metals in the filtered salt. Variations in the other results are probably within the combined reproducibility of the analytical methods and the test procedure. If these concentrations are indicative of solids passing through the filter plates rather than unreduced metals, then the data reflect the particle size distribution of the reduced material.

Technical feasibility of the Brillo process, a method for removal of protactinium from 7LiF-BeF2-ThF melts by reduction from the salt phase and adsorption on steel wool, was demonstrated previously and has been described. Because the application of this method involves separations of liquids and solids in highly radioactive environments, its adaptation at the engineering scale does not seem to be attractive. For this reason, we have begun.

Studies in which protactinium is reduced by liquid bismuth-thorium alloys. The results of similar studies conducted at the tracer level indicate that removal of protactinium from molten fluorides by liquid metal extraction is a potentially successful fuel reprocessing method. This investigation is designed to confirm the chemical validity of the process and to provide basic information needed to establish optimal processing conditions.

Previously, we found that in LiF-ThF melts, iron is reduced rapidly at 600°C by thorium and at a much slower rate by hydrogen. We chose to examine the reduction of iron at 700°C in an LiF-ThF 4 melt which also contained protactinium. Treatment of the melt with hydrogen reduced the iron concentration from an original concentration of 500 ppm to 3 ppm (as indicated by 59Fe counts) in about 18 hr, in contrast to a 40-hr period required at 600°C. The quantitative significance of the results obtained was somewhat impaired by partial loss of protactinium during hydrogen treatment and during transfer from the nickel pot to a graphite-lined pot. However, it appears qualitatively that there is little difference in the behavior of protactinium metal during reduction with solid thorium except that in the presence of iron a slightly greater fraction of protactinium remains in the unfiltered salt sample after reduction than is found when using the bismuth-thorium alloy.

In summary, analyses of both filtered and unfiltered samples of bismuth and salt phases removed after 16 and 20 hr contact accounted for only about 42% of the uranium added initially to the bismuth. This probably indicated that part of the uranium was precipitated as UO2 by oxygen or water vapor inadvertently introduced into the system. Both reactions have positive free energy for the direction indicated, but since ThF4 is present in large excess over the amount of U or UO2, and since complexing of the UF4 by LiF occurs in the molten-salt phase, either reaction might be expected to take place. Since the relative contribution of the two possible reactions cannot be evaluated, the data obtained have only qualitative significance. This indicates that the UO2 either dissolved or dispersed in the salt as it froze, and since the salt was quite green, it seems most likely that it.

Repetition of the experiment resulted in a significant improvement. Uranium losses were found to be negligible, and the protactinium removal rate was encouragingly rapid. Protactinium distribution data displayed in Fig. 6 showed a marked drop in concentration in the bismuth during the first 5 hr, with relatively little change during the last 11 hr. Although the concentrations of protactinium in the salt phase appear to vary somewhat, about 90% of the initial amount of the element was removed from the salt after 5 hr of contact.

Two experiments were performed to measure the extent of transfer of protactinium to bismuth-thorium alloy and the distribution of uranium. In both experiments, the amount of thorium added initially to the bismuth was sufficient to give a concentration of 2500 ppm if all the thorium dissolved. We assume that water vapor or oxygen in the system was causing the precipitation of protactinium.

Because 90% of the thorium in the bismuth-thorium alloys was converted to ThO2, despite the presence of ThO2, about 1.0 to 1.5% of the protactinium was transferred to the bismuth with a low concentration of thorium metal in the bismuth. The protactinium transfer rate increased sharply to about 20% of the total within 1 hr when an additional amount of thorium (totaling 2500 ppm) was added. The protactinium content of the bismuth dropped to about 12% of the total in the system after standing overnight under flowing helium without agitation, and a further drop to about 3% occurred when the phases were mixed by sparging with helium for 1 hr. A large increase in the protactinium content of unfiltered salt was noted after the gas sparging.

An additional experiment resulted in the most complete transfer of protactinium from salt to bismuth that has been experienced to date. The results, displayed in Fig. 7, show about 80% of the protactinium in the filtered bismuth after only 30 min contact of the phases.

If we assume that the calculated protactinium content of the bismuth in the first sample was too high, then it appears that there was relatively little change in the protactinium content of the bismuth over an 18-hr period. The minimum protactinium balance observed in this experiment was 80% (18-hr samples). The uranium distribution data are displayed in Fig. 8. The uranium was present in the salt at an initial concentration of about 50 ppm. About 80% was found in the filtered bismuth, and there was very little left in the filtered salt after 18 hr contact time. Furthermore, the data indicate that the transfer of uranium to the bismuth occurred rapidly, as did the transfer of protactinium.

A series of four experiments was performed with the single-region reactor fuel composition LiF-BeF2-ThF4 (72-16-12 mole %). The principal variables were the concentration of uranium fluoride added to the salt phase and the thorium concentration in the bismuth. Lanthanum was added to the salt in some experiments.

Protactinium distribution data in run 1-30, shown in 0.9, indicate that protactinium reduction was nearly complete after 4 hr contact of the salt and bismuth phases with gas (helium) mixing. However, protactinium transfer to the bismuth was much less complete than in the case of the two-region blanket composition (0.7), and the protactinium balance after the first (30-min) set of samples was poor. This shows that a large fraction of the protactinium was associated with some solid phase and was inaccessible to sampling. The amount of thorium metal present was more than enough to saturate the bismuth at the temperature of the experiment (625°C), so that insoluble intermetallic complexes may have been present in addition to solid thorium. Lanthanum reduction was quite incomplete, and the 14% La balance was not very good except for the 30-min samples, where 98% was found in the filtered salt and 2% in the 14° La (not shown in 0. 9).

The amount of thorium added in run 2-5 (3. 0 g of thorium to 300 g of bismuth) was calculated to provide an excess of 2500 ppm Th. The protactinium distribution data are shown in Figure 10. Protactinium in filtered salt samples went through a minimum at about 8 hr contact time and then increased, while that in the filtered bismuth decreased after reaching a maximum at the same contact time. The uranium distribution (Figure 11) shows a minimum in the uranium concentration of filtered salt samples.

The uranium concentration in the bismuth did not drop off during the same period. Dropped off steadily during the course of the experiment, from an initial concentration of 2500 ppm to 160 ppm after 19 hr contact time. The final low concentration of thorium in the bismuth provides a possible explanation for the protactinium distribution data observed in this experiment, but there is no obvious explanation for thorium loss, except for short exposure of stainless steel samplers during removal of bismuth samples. Graphite was the only structural material in contact with the two phases. The copper salt samplers only contact the salt phase during sampling. Approximately 28 hr were required to redissolve all the protactinium because it was necessary to hydrofluorinate all the metallic thorium and uranium in the system as well as the reduced protactinium.

We had previously demonstrated reversibility of the protactinium precipitation in some experiments with solid thorium, but this was the first time that we showed that liquid bismuth does not interfere with the hydrofluorination process. Previously reported tracer-level experiments indicated that this result would be expected.

The thorium concentration in the metal phase (corrected for salt contamination by assuming that all beryllium present was due to salt) is also shown in the same figure. This compares with the uniform rate of decrease of 125 ppm/hr over an 18-hr period in run 2-5. 6%. The protactinium balance was poor, and the amount found on the stainless steel filter through which the filtered bismuth passed was relatively large, showing that there was a great deal of insoluble protactinium in the metal phase. The lanthanum data were much like those in run 2-5. The 14°La concentration in filtered salt samples decreased to 82% of the initial value after 22% hr contact, but the maximum concentration observed in filtered bismuth was 0. 5% (3 hr contact time).

The last experiment in the series (run 2-26) represented an effort to avoid insoluble phases in the bismuth. The initial addition of thorium (504 mg) was calculated to leave 1000 ppm excess thorium in the bismuth after all uranium and protactinium were completely reduced. After 17 hours, a second addition of 506 mg of thorium was made. Only 5Pa data are available at present.

We mentioned in our previous report that there were indications that NaBF4, recrystallized from dilute hydrofluoric acid solutions, was less pure than KBF4 prepared by the same procedure and that alternative methods of purifying NaBF4 were being considered. One process that has worked well with some materials, slow recrystallization from the melt by passing a tube filled with the material through a temperature gradient, failed to produce any significant improvement in the sharpness of the differential thermal analysis (DTA) melting curve, the most sensitive measure of compound purity that we have available. We found that improved purity of NaBF4 was achieved by treating molten NaBF4 at 425°C with a mixture of anhydrous HF, BF3, and helium (2 volumes of BF3 per volume of HF). The sharpness of the DTA melting curve for NaBF4 resulting from this treatment approached that produced by our best.

Investigation of phase relations in the system NaF-KF-BF at atmospheric pressure is limited. % of BF exists only in equilibrium with high pressures of BF. This system is of interest because it would be desirable to have a coolant with an even lower liquidus temperature than is provided by the NaF-NaBF system (380°C).

Phase diagrams for two pseudo-binary systems that form part of the ternary system have been published in another report. The NaF-KBF system has a eutectic containing about 96 mol% of KBF, melting at 540 ± 5°C. The high-temperature forms of the compounds NaBF and KBF make a continuous series of solid solutions with a minimum-melting composition containing approximately 85 mol% NaBF4. 14. 1. There is a ternary eutectic composition in the binary eutectic. The NaF primary phase field covers a large area of the diagram.

Shawshaw Chemical Co. — Division of Kewanee Oil Co. , Cleveland, Ohio. Specifications supplied by the manufacturer were: NaBF4, 99. 08% oxygen, 0. 025%, were confirmed by ORNL analyses, and a total of 2400 lb of this material was received. Major portions are available for study.

Experimental phase diagram data available from the preceding semiannual report were examined for deviations from ideality of mixing. Slightly revised liquidus curves for KF and NaF in the binary salt system KF-KBF, and the reciprocal salt system NaF-KBF, respectively, are shown in Fig. 2. The revision is based upon an appropriate application of the known enthalpies of fusion of NaF and KF (ΔHf = 7. 90 and 6. 75 kcal/mole) to the liquidus near 100% NaF and KF respectively. The latter were estimated semiquantitatively in terms of the partial molar excess free energy of NaF, G, by means of the equation.

Stone has cast some doubt about the feasibility of such measurements in a nickel container. A thorium rod suspended in a molten mixture of the LiF-ThF2 (73-27 mole %) contained in a nickel crucible disappeared after 16 hr at a temperature of 600°C. Black magnetic material removed from the cooled melt analyzed 45% Ni and 30% Th, while nonmagnetic material contained 22% Ni and 49.5% Th. An explanation was based on the assumption that the reaction.

Occurs and that the ThF, when it diffuses to the nickel wall, disproportionates because of the formation of the Th-Ni intermetallic compound. However, the speculative nature of this explanation was emphasized, as very little is known about the existence of a ThF2.

If such a reaction with the nickel container actually occurs, severe complications would arise in an attempt to measure the free energy of formation of ThF in the above cell. Before abandoning this much-preferred cell arrangement, a reinvestigation of the reaction of Th with the LiF-ThF melt was deemed desirable.

A carefully dehydrated mixture of LiF-ThF₂ (73 and 27 mole % respectively) was melted in a thorium crucible and held in the molten state under an atmosphere of dry argon at a temperature of 620°C. The melt was frequently stirred with a thorium stirrer. After a heating period of 16 hours, a sample of the molten liquid was withdrawn in a tantalum cup. The apparatus utilized for this experiment has been previously described.

A layer of material was found at the bottom of the melt. Apparently, segregation had occurred upon slow cooling. This black material reacted vigorously with hydrochloric acid. A hydrogen evolution analysis yielded a value of 12. 5% by weight calculated as free thorium metal. Spectrographic analysis showed the presence of only very minor quantities of other metals as impurities. Of some significance is the absence of detectable quantities of nickel, possibly attributable to the very small surface ratio of nickel rod to thorium crucible. X-ray examination of this blackish material showed lines only of the compounds existing in this melt composition; that is, mainly Li, ThF, and a small amount of LiThF. In agreement with this, microscopic examination showed the blackish material to be comprised mainly of the salt mixture.

In a closed apparatus of known volume, BF, pressures in equilibrium with the melt were measured manometrically in the composition range 2 to ~100 mole % NaBF3. For each composition, pressures were measured over at least a 150° temperature interval within overall limits of 425.

Where Py is the pressure of BF in equilibrium with a melt whose composition is denoted by f(W), defined as the number of moles of NaF initially loaded minus the number of moles of BF in the vapor divided by the number of moles of NaBF and NaF initially loaded. The composition variable, f(V), is very close to, but not exactly equal to, the equilibrium mole fraction of NaF in the melt. Equation (1) was derived from the Gibbs-Duhem equation for the molten phase.

The integral on the right-hand side of Eq. (1) was solved graphically using Simpson's rule. By integration of the Gibbs-Duhem equation, activities of NaF were derived from the activities of NaBF4. For the most part, the activities exhibited slightly positive deviations from ideality. In other words, activity coefficients, defined in terms of the pure liquid components, were greater.

A preliminary corrosion test showed that metallic chromium (the component of Hastelloy N most readily oxidized in molten fluoride media) reacted with the molten mixture proposed as the MSRE substitute coolant, NaF-NaBF4 (92-8 mole %). Two products of the reaction were crystalline Na2CrF6 and gaseous BF3. Most likely, the removal of NaF from the melt in forming Na2CrF6 caused a shift in the equilibrium.

Thereby establishing a higher vapor pressure of a program of tests is in progress to determine if Hastelloy N itself reacts unfavorably with NaBF4 melts; verify the initial results with pure chromium; and observe whether nickel and iron also react.

In each test, a salt sample of about 100 g partially decomposes (according to the above reaction) in an evacuated container fabricated from or containing samples of the test metal. The gas pressure and temperature are continuously monitored. Based on the preliminary study, we anticipated that for a constant temperature, the gas pressure would increase at a rate proportional to the chromium corrosion rate. After runs are completed, the containers are cut open, and the contents examined.

The condition of the Hastelloy N containers and specimens following tests 1 and 2 (see Table 14. 1) indicated a rather sluggish reaction with NaBF4. On the other hand, increases of nickel and chromium in the salt indicated that moderate corrosion occurred. 5.

Test 3, however, provided more encouraging results with regard to both nickel and chromium corrosion. The lack of nickel corrosion in test 3 was essentially verified in test 5. It is possible that the vessels in tests 1 and 2 had undergone some corrosion prior to being loaded with fluoroborate and that the corrosion product was subsequently dissolved by the salt.

In connection with the investigation of fluoroborates as a coolant for molten-salt reactors, the following tests of compatibility and solubility of KBF4 and NaBF4 with various fluoride mixtures and with B2O3 were carried out. It was found that silica and, at lower temperatures, even Pyrex containers were suitable for these tests, thus providing the great advantage of direct visual examination. As a result, the occurrence of liquid-liquid immiscibility was quickly detected, a phenomenon which was not detected by less direct DTA and quenching techniques. In all tests, the samples were evacuated several times and flushed with helium prior to melting.

The following list summarizes the tests in which liquid immiscibility was observed. Unless otherwise stated, the container material was fused silica. Since UF did not show spectrophotometrically any solubility in NaBF2 or in KBF3, it was used for spiking other fluorides as a visual aid in the detection of phase separations. In some instances, KBF3 was used rather than NaBF2 because its higher melting point was closer to the melting point of some fluoride mixtures.

Indeed, this is a commonly used method to generate BF. Nonetheless, we decided to explore the effect of B2O3 additions to immiscible liquids. Boron was detected in all tests where B2O3 was added directly, and no extraction of UF6 or precipitation of UO2 was noted. The resulting borate phases were very viscous.

Finally, in another series of tests 2LiF-BeF2 was equilibrated with NaBF4 in sealed nickel containers at 600°C. The capsules were quenched, and the two phases sampled and analyzed. The results (Table 14. 2) show appreciable distribution of all the components (NaF, LiF, BF4, and BeF2) between the two phases in each phase.

Molten-salt breeder reactors will operate at fuel salt power densities of 300 to 700 W/cc in comparison with the peak level of 24 W/cc in the MSRE. Knowledge of the effects of such exposures on fuel salt stability and materials compatibility for both design and foreseeable off-design conditions is essential for the success of the breeder program. The fates of the fission products are also of interest in terms of separations processing and possible poisoning due to accumulation on or in the graphite moderator. Molten-salt convection loop experiments are being operated in beam hole HN-1 of the ORR to develop data pertinent to the breeder program.

Examination of the second loop experiment was completed during this period. No unexpected materials problems were encountered except for the fact that the salt had wetted the graphite, presumably because of small amounts of moisture present in the gas used in loading, sampling, and draining manipulations.

A prototype of a third loop, modified to provide for better graphite examinations both pre- and post-irradiation, has been constructed, and components for the in-pile version have been fabricated of Hastelloy N modified to improve high-temperature ductility after irradiation. Work on the experiment has been discontinued because of budget limitations and investigations of effects of moisture levels in the cover and manipulatory gas.

In the interim, a program of capsule irradiations of fluoroborate coolant salt in spent HFIR fuel elements is in progress. Gamma fluxes comparable to those present in the MSRE heat exchanger are available in the center of such elements. Examination of the first capsule experiment showed no gross effects of the accumulation of a dose.

The fuel salt, graphite, and metal in contact with fissioning fuel salt and cover gas determine the distribution of fission product activities in the loop components. A prototype of a third loop assembly has been designed, and component parts have been fabricated.

As reported previously, the activity of a given isotope to be expected in the system at a particular time was estimated by a detailed application of standard equations to the individual irradiation and inventory periods with adjustment for decay to the final ORR shutdown for the experiment. Data received during the current period permit completion of the isotope activity balance.

The activities of the fission products Cs-133, Ce-144, and Zr-95 were used as internal standards to estimate the average flux received by the salt under the assumption that they were not appreciably lost from the salt. A mean flux to the salt of 0. 88 x 10^3 was thus estimated. From this value, total activities of the various isotopes produced in the ORR loop experiment were calculated.

The calculations described above provided an estimate of the amount of each isotope to be accounted for. We determined the total amount of the isotope actually found in the system by dividing the loop into regions, analyzing a specimen from each region, and allocating a proportionate amount of activity to the region.

For the various samples obtained from the loop, activity determinations for the 13 isotopes shown in Table 15. 1 were made, as well as sensitive determinations of 235U. The activities have been totaled for each isotope under the categories of graphite, loop metal, salt sample lines, gas sample and inlet lines, and salt. These values, plus the estimated total activities calculated from inventory and irradiation history, are also shown.

A substantial proportion, although less than half, was accounted for in the cases of 9Nb, 140Ba, and 134I. Inasmuch as iodine readily volatilizes from all solid samples (without doubt from powdered graphite in particular), it is to be expected that iodine determinations would be low.

The amounts of the respective fission product isotopes that penetrated the graphite to given depths were obtained from the samples shaved from the fuel channels. Data for each isotope and each common cut depth were summed over all the fuel channels. The value was corrected for the amount of the isotope in the salt in the sample based on the amount of 35U, which was found and on the concentration of the isotope in regular salt samples. This correction was appreciable only for those isotopes found principally in salt and was never dominant.

The amount of an isotope in the graphite up to a given depth was then divided by the total amount of the isotope found in the loop, yielding the percentage of the particular fission product that penetrated to that depth in the graphite. Thus, about 43% of the fission product Te-3 that was found was deposited within 1. 3 mils of the graphite surface, and about 58% within the.

°F estimated for total salt based on each of two final samples. Niobium-95 based on the earlier sample because production from 90Zr in salt during the final period tended to remain in the salt, which was frozen most of the final two weeks. Seventeen and twenty-one percent were found in the two final samples.

On the other extreme in quantity are 131Te, 99Mo, and 103Ru. These isotopes showed 35 to 43% in the first 1. 3 mils; 52 to 56% within 3. 1 mils, and not much more at greater depths. These isotopes are thus indicated to deposit strongly from the salt onto the graphite surface but migrate only weakly if at all after deposition.

Iodine-131 also exhibited such a pattern, although it was present in low quantity, and amounts varied from sample to sample. Since iodine is not expected to be volatile from molten salt, either a volatile precursor is implied, or migration could have occurred after the salt was frozen or during subsequent handling.

During post-irradiation examination of the second in-pile molten-salt loop, evidence of surface wetting of the core graphite by salt was noted. We wish to establish procedures to prevent this in the next loop experiment. We have recently studied, in a vacuum box, the wetting characteristics of droplets of MSRE solvent salt on a platelet of MSRE graphite. We confirm, generally, the observation of Kreyger, Kirslis, and Blankenship that wetting is due to three-phase contact of gas, graphite, and molten salt at moisture levels as.

In an atmosphere of tank helium (below 4 ppm water), the droplets on melting did not wet the graphite. However, in a few minutes, they developed a translucent crust; and in 1 to 2 hours after melting, had slumped and spread spasmodically over the graphite surface. Another droplet was melted on graphite under good vacuum (less than 10~ torr, the present gauge limit) and remained clear and round for about 20 hours. However, when tank helium was admitted to a pressure of 0.

The surface wetting behavior of the salt thus appears to be very sensitive to very slight impurities, presumably water, in the helium. This could have been accentuated in these studies because of the small amount of salt and the large amount of gas. Further, the lack of wetting of the graphite by salt in the experiment under vacuum indicates that the prior condition of graphite or salt did not control the wetting behavior.

The in-pile operation of the second molten-salt loop experiment was terminated because of a crack in the core outlet pipe, resulting in fission product leakage. Based on evidence from post-irradiation examination and evaluation of the effects of neutron irradiation on the properties of Hastelloy N, it was determined that this failure was due to the deterioration of stress rupture properties caused by neutron irradiation. Consequently, the third loop assembly will be made of a modified Hastelloy N alloy containing titanium as an additive to enhance resistance to radiation-induced high-temperature embrittlement. The necessary shapes for constructing the loop components have been acquired from an ingot of such a material (~0.5% Ti, 2% W).

We have also redesigned the graphite core section of the next loop to provide additional graphite surveillance specimens. The redesigned core has four holes of 1-inch-square cross-section instead of the eight 1/2-inch-diameter round holes for salt flow used for the two loops previously operated in the pile. 2. The flat surfaces of these graphite specimens will permit improved pre-irradiation evaluation of the graphite quality and post-irradiation examination to determine the interaction of graphite and salt. Metal locating brackets will be used to position the graphite specimens and will also serve as surveillance specimens for metals.

Gamma trays might ionize and decompose sodium fluoroborate to produce boron, fluorine, and sodium fluoride. The fluorine generated by either process would probably react with structural metals of the system to form their fluorides. In the projected test of the 8% NaF—92% NaBF4 eutectic mixture in MSRE, the neutron flux is negligible (~6 x 10° nv); therefore, the present studies are emphasizing the effects of gamma radiation. The gamma irradiation experiments are conducted in the central channel of spent HFIR fuel elements in the storage pool of the HFIR, where very high gamma fluxes are available (~8 x 107 r/hr for elements four days old). This is comparable with the gamma flux in the MSRE heat exchanger.

For the first gamma irradiation experiment, 34 g of an NaF-NaBF4 eutectic mixture with a melting point of 380°C was placed in a Hastelloy N container containing a corrosion test specimen. The salt was melted in the capsule in an argon atmosphere box, and then the capsule was welded shut. A capillary tube connected the gas space above the salt to a pressure transducer.

Prior to the start of irradiation, the capsule containing the sodium fluoroborate was vacuum-pumped (5 x 10^-5 torr) for 16 hours at 150°C to remove any moisture and residual gas. The capsule was then sealed by closing the valve on the gas line and held at 450°C for 3 hours. On cooling to 20°C, a residual pressure of ~5 torrs was observed. Analysis of the residual gas by mass spectrograph showed it to contain N2 (73%), Ar (13%), CO2 (8%), H2 (4%), O2 (2%), and H2O (0. 2%). The observed pressure at 600°C was 145 mm Hg—close to the value anticipated for BF3 vapor pressure according to Cantor's data. When cooled to 20°C, residual gas pressure was below the limit of detection (~5 torrs).

The capsule assembly was then placed in the center of HFIR fuel element 34 on February 2nd, operating at 100 MW. The sodium fluoroborate salt temperature reached 465°C from gamma heat alone (estimated to be 0. 25 W/g). Electrical heat was then added to bring the temperature to 600°C.

In the container surrounding the capsule, and the experiment was removed from the fuel element. No evidence of water in the container was found by vacuum pumping while heating the capsule to ~100°C. However, only the thermocouple located on the wall by the gas space of the capsule was still operating. The experiment was again placed in the center of the fuel element and operated at 600°C, as indicated by the above thermocouple.

Residual gas pressure in the capsule was ~10 torrs at 50°C, and it was found to contain a large percentage of hydrogen by mass spectrographic analysis (85% N2, 12% H2O, 2% CO2, 1% Ar, 0. 3% O2, 0. 1%), which was confirmed by gas chromatography. The source of the hydrogen in the residual cover gas is not known; incompletely fluorinated fluoroborate (NaBF4OH) and indiffusion of radiolytic or corrosion hydrogen from the water in the containment are possibilities.

Upon opening the aluminum container can, it was found to contain sufficient water to soak the magnesia insulating pad under the capsule. Since the capsule bottom was in contact with a water-soaked insulation pad, a severe temperature gradient undoubtedly existed from the top to bottom of the capsule for most of the irradiation period. However, it is estimated that at least part of the NaF-NaBF4 salt in the capsule remained frozen after the first two days of operation. Since no leaks were found in the aluminum can by pressure testing, it is assumed that water was inadvertently spilled into the can through the container access tube.

The capsule was cut open, and the corrosion test specimen and salt were removed. No visual evidence of corrosion was seen. The salt, however, was discolored. Several sharply defined layers of salt of varying shades of pink from the bottom to about the center were observed.

The thin dark-brown layer on the bottom. The upper half of the salt was a mottled gray-white. The layers are believed to be associated with solidification progressing upward from the bottom as the internal gamma heating diminished, with the moist insulation permitting significant heat removal.

An unirradiated capsule assembly, identical to the irradiated capsule, was operated molten for 840 hours (mostly at 600°C) as a control for the irradiation experiment. Salt removed from this experiment was entirely white and rather frangible, with none of the pink-brown discoloration observed in the irradiated salt. However, small brilliant green crystals identified microscopically as Na2CrF6 were found near metal surfaces — particularly at the bottom.

Samples of salt removed at various levels from the respective irradiated and unirradiated experiments were examined by mass spectrographic analyses. In each case, the bottom layer contained 10,000 ppm Cr or more and about 2000 ppm Al, as well as smaller but appreciable amounts of a number of other impurities. The Na/B atom ratio ranged between 0.96 and 1.12 for most regions as might be expected for the sodium fluoroborate—sodium fluoride mixture (nominally, Na/B ~ 1.09). The region of the unirradiated material with green crystals showed an Na/B ratio of 1.26, whereas the corresponding dark-brown bottom region of the irradiated salt had a ratio of 1.09.

Hastelloy N coupons exposed in the irradiated and unirradiated tests exhibited negligible attack, other than a few surface stains. Microscopic examination revealed a general slight dulling – more evident at the liquid surface and above, and somewhat more pronounced on the unirradiated coupon. The weight change of the unirradiated specimen corresponded to less than 0. 01 mil/year; for the irradiated coupon, the weight change was zero.

The primary structural materials in molten-salt reactors are Hastelloy N and graphite. Our experience with the MSRE has demonstrated the excellent compatibility of these materials with fluoride salts in a nuclear environment. We have a surveillance facility in the MSRE that allows us to periodically remove graphite and Hastelloy N specimens for examination. Both materials have been used in our fission product studies, and we have run mechanical property tests on the Hastelloy N to follow the changes in the properties of the reactor.

Then in the MSRE, the graphite will be exposed to higher fluences and must have low permeability to gaseous fission products. We presently have a facility for irradiating graphite to a fluence of about 3 x 10 nvt (> 50 keV) per year, and we are investigating the dimensional changes that occur in various grades of graphite. We plan to reduce the permeability of graphite by surface sealing with metals or pyrocarbon. We have developed a modified Hastelloy N with superior resistance to irradiation damage and are studying its properties in detail. Some new salt compositions are of interest for MSBRs, and we are expanding our corrosion program to investigate their compatibility with Hastelloy N.

We maintain a graphite and Hastelloy N surveillance program to follow the changes in properties with irradiation of the graphite and Hastelloy N used in the MSRE. A special fixture has been designed so that these materials can be exposed to the MSRE environment and removed periodically for examination. The graphite has been used principally for fission product deposition studies, since we presently do not have hot-cell techniques.

For measuring the very small changes in physical properties that have likely taken place, the Hastelloy N is in a form that can be converted to mechanical test specimens quite easily, and we have evaluated its post-irradiation properties by tensile and creep-rupture tests.

The space in the surveillance fixture is somewhat larger than required to follow the property changes in the same materials used to construct the MSRE. Hence, we have inserted some special types of graphite and Hastelloy N: (1) to gain a better understanding of fission product behavior; (2) to obtain compatibility information; and (3) to determine irradiation damage information.

A stringer of standard Hastelloy N specimens from outside the reactor vessel was also removed. These specimens had been exposed to the MSRE cell environment for about 11,000 hr and had accumulated a peak thermal dose of about 3 x 10^20 neutrons/cm. The vessel specimens were made of the same heats used in constructing the MSRE.

The creep-rupture properties of the heats of standard Hastelloy N are shown in Fig. 1. Data are shown for (1) the first set of specimens removed from the core after 4800 hr with a thermal fluence of 1. The specimens irradiated to the lower fluence generally had a larger rupture life at a given stress, although the differences become quite small at low stresses (compare points for heat 5085). We have no explanation for the superior rupture life of heat 5081.

The fracture strains of the vessel heats are shown in Figure 3. The scatter band was determined from a large number of data points, with heat 5065 being on the lower side and heat 5085 being on the upper side. The minimum fracture strain at a strain rate of about 0.1% per hour clearly exists for materials exposed to irradiation for about 1000 hours at 650°C, whereas the data for the surveillance specimens do not suggest the existence of this minimum. However, heat 5081 is somewhat anomalous and exhibits higher fracture strains with the trend of increasing fracture strain with decreasing creep rate. The results on heat 5085 indicate that the fracture strain may be decreased only slightly by increasing the fluence.

The tensile properties of the air-melted surveillance materials are shown in Table 17.1 for test conditions of 25 and 650°C. The fracture strains at 650°C are considerably lower at the higher fluence. The reduction in ductility at 25°C is thought to be associated with carbide precipitation in the alloy and is probably a function of both the thermal history and the fluence.

Fluoride salts, the fracture strain, and the rupture life at a given stress are both reduced but not to levels that should prevent the continued successful operation of the MSRE. The property changes noted in increasing the fluence from 3 x 10^20 to 1.3 x 10^20 neutrons/cm were quite small. The vessel should not reach a thermal fluence of 1.3 x 10^20 neutrons/cm until after 150,000 Mwhr of operation. 3 x 10^20 neutrons.

The titanium- and zirconium-modified alloys that were removed from the core were heat-treated to obtain a very fine grain size. At the time these were inserted, it was thought that the fracture strain increased with decreasing grain size. However, subsequent tests showed that the reverse was true. The post-irradiation properties of these materials were quite comparable to those noted for the standard Hastelloy N.

The current studies on graphite for molten-salt breeder reactors include the determination of the physical and mechanical properties before and after irradiation; sealing research with pyrolytic carbon; and chemical-vapor-deposited niobium. Some graphite for item 4 is on order. The graphite manufactured by Poco Graphite, Inc. continues to be our reference graphite for the sealing and joining work because it has reasonable uniformity and pore entrance diameters.

The treatment was used to remove fingerprints or other contaminants from graphite test pieces before they were sealed by the vapor deposition of metals. Specimens given this pretreatment were unusually permeable and were not sealed by reasonable metal deposits. Microstructural examination showed that the normal, relatively uniform pore structure with entrance diameters approximately 1 μm now had a secondary set of pores with some more than a hundred times as large as the.

A lot of material. Control and test specimens were taken from three random rods. Test specimens from each rod were given the standard pretreatment, and duplicate specimens were given the same anneal in an argon environment. The normal grade AXF graphite microstructure, as shown in Fig. 1a, was observed for all three controls and the test specimens treated in argon. All those given the standard oxidation pretreatment developed the large secondary set of pores shown in Fig. 185 and c. The voids were at irregular depths ranging from 20 mils to completely through (pore) sizes graded from large to small from the external surfaces to inside the specimens.

The samples used in the sealing studies were large voids introduced by oxidation, generally penetrating the entire wall. The pretreatment in air will not be used in future work. Surface contamination will be reduced by more careful handling, followed by anneals in argon or vacuum.

Are closely related to its resistance to radiation damage. We are concerned with the determination of lattice parameters (in both the c and a directions), preferred orientation, and crystallite size (L). Quantitative data are difficult to obtain and are strongly affected by equipment and analytical.

We have begun measurements of the crystallite sizes and lattice parameters of nearly isotropic polycrystalline graphite to develop an accurate approach for data gathering and analysis. The lattice parameter measurements are reasonably consistent and agree well with those obtained by other investigators. These variations probably reflect differences in crystal perfection.

The crystallite size measurements were determined independently from the broadening of the (002) and (004) diffraction peaks. These determinations should give identical values for L, but the data in Table 18. 2 show that this was not the case. The basic Scherrer equation used in analyzing these results involves an instrumental correction factor. Again, different results were obtained using the correction factor suggested by Scherrer and the one later proposed by Warren.

In addition to crystallite size, there are at least six other factors which may contribute to line broadening: (1) compositional variations, (2) small crystallite size, (3) inhomogeneous strains, (4) stacking faults, (5) range of wavelengths in incident beams, (6) instrumental factors, and (7) low absorption in the sample. Thus, the Scherrer equation leaves us with a rather meaningless summation of these factors. Therefore, in the future, we plan to use a more accurate Fourier approach for the analysis of peak shapes rather than using only peak breadths. In this manner, we can separate more of the factors and obtain a more realistic measurement of the crystallite.

One of the requirements for graphite to be used in a molten-salt breeder reactor is a surface with low permeability to prevent xenon absorption. Calculations suggest that a helium permeability of less than 10^-7 cm/sec at the graphite surface will be required to keep the xenon concentration in the core to the desired level. Since commercially available graphites usually have helium permeabilities some five or six orders of magnitude higher than this required level, it is necessary to consider coating or sealing the graphite surface.

Present considerations are to seal the graphite surface either with pyrolytic carbon or with a metal such as molybdenum or niobium. If a metal is employed, the amount must be strictly limited to avoid excessive neutron absorption penalties. Though no such volume limitation per se exists in the case of pyrolytic carbon, there is a limitation on the means of employing it.

We are exploring methods of gas-impregnating graphite with carbon. A technique for providing a very low permeability surface seal by immersing a graphite specimen in a fluidized bed has been demonstrated, but this method may be impractical for large bodies such as are required in a molten salt reactor. Another method we are studying involves forcing the carbon-bearing gas radially through a heated specimen up a thermal gradient. The thermal gradient is achieved radially in the specimen by heating it with a 1. 2-kW, 450-kc induction generator while cooling the inside by means of an axial gin. water line. We selected the specimen geometry to meet the requirements of the HFIR irradiation facility (i. e. , a hollow right circular cylinder of nominal dimensions). The base stock is Poco graphite grade AXF. During impregnation, the specimen is clamped between spring-loaded mullite tubes which seal against the ends with Grafoil gaskets. Sources of carbon being considered are methane and propylene.

Preliminary impregnation experiments indicate that this range of as-received permeabilities may not be important for carbon impregnation, but we will examine this point in detail. With the above techniques, we have sealed two specimens so that the helium leak rates measured by the Veeco detector are less than half that of our 4.5 x 10-8 std cm/sec standard leak. Though sealing at the ends of the specimen is a problem with this.

We are also studying a system which cycles between vacuum and hydrocarbon atmosphere while the graphite substrate is heated to temperatures of 800 to 1300°C. The variables being considered in this system are temperature, cycle time, concentration of hydrocarbon gas, system pressure, and original substrate porosity.

The experimental apparatus includes a silica tube with the test specimen suspended inside by a graphite thread. The silica tube is closed at each end by a solenoid valve; the bottom one is connected to a vacuum pump, and the top one to a source of hydrocarbon gas. The two solenoids are controlled by a pulse timer that automatically switches the system between vacuum and a hydrocarbon atmosphere at preset.

The first carbon source we used with this system was a mixture of 1,3-butadiene in argon (10% C4H6 + 90% Ar). We found that by using argon as the diluent, we could operate from 150 to 200°C hotter with the same power setting than with helium as the diluent. We later found that the time required to seal a sample can be reduced by using undiluted butadiene. We selected butadiene as the carbon source because it decomposes at a lower temperature than hydrocarbons such as methane and propylene and has a high carbon-to-volume of gas ratio.

The impregnation process appears to be quite sensitive to temperature. At temperatures above 1000°C, the processes studied tend to coat the samples rather than impregnate them. At temperatures in the range of 800 to 950°C, undiluted butadiene appears to penetrate the pores, but the deposit is probably one or more of a family of highly viscous hydrocarbons. These tars, when baked out, release hydrogen, which tends to reopen the pores to some degree.

Several samples were prepared by pulsing between 5 sec of vacuum (<25 in. Hg) and a pressure of 10 psig of undiluted butadiene in the temperature range 800 to 900°C. We found that samples could be made leak-tight after a total hydrocarbon contact time of 1 to 2 hr. The expression leak-tight here means a leak rate less than the standard used, which was 4. 5 x 10-8 std cm3/sec of helium. These samples were then heated to 1300°C, cooled, and rechecked for.

The sample impregnated at 900°C that remained impermeable to helium after heating at 1300°C was heated to 2000°C for 5 min. The dimensions remained the same with a very slight loss in weight, and the helium leak rate was 200 x 10^-6 std cm^3/sec after 20 min of helium purge.

This specimen was then re-impregnated at 900°C and heated at 2000°C. This time, no leak was detected by the Veeco instrument, which means that the helium permeability was less than 10 cm/sec. There was no measurable thickness of coating on the outside of the specimen as a result of the two impregnations. Thus, we feel that the pulsing technique for gas impregnation of graphite with carbon is the most promising technique we have tried. Furthermore, this technique should be relatively easy to scale up and is equally applicable to either hollow tubes or solid rods.

Detailed analysis of the molybdenum-coated R-0025 graphite samples reported previously indicated that there was no direct connection between the thickness of the metal coating and the helium permeability of the coated sample. The first experiment, M-Mo-1, which had a coating of approximately 0. 05 mil, had a permeability too small to be detected by a Veeco leak detector. The other eight samples had coatings up to 0. 275 mil and would not pump down low enough to measure the permeability. We decided that this lack of correlation must be due to the inhomogeneity of the R-0025 starting material.

Twenty samples of AXF graphite were obtained. Prior to coating, each sample was tested by attempting to pump a vacuum on it with the pumps of the Veeco leak detector. Pressures down to 0. 001 torr can be measured. After coating, the sample was again pumped, and the pressure was recorded. If the pressure was 0. 001 torr, an attempt was made to measure the permeability.

The experimental conditions and results are shown in Table 18. 3. The coatings reduced the permeability of all samples except the third, M-Mo-12, which was more permeable after coating. On this sample, the coating outlined a fingerprint very clearly, and this contaminant probably contributed to the poor coating characteristics. All subsequent samples were annealed for 1 hr at 600°C in air before coating to remove.

For all the remaining samples (M-Mo-13 through M-Mo-28), the vacuum achieved on the coated samples seems to be a function of both the precoat vacuum and deposit thickness. Only five samples had permeabilities low enough to be pumped to the range of 7x10^-7 to 1.5x10^7 cm^3/sec that can be measured with the leak detector. In M-Mo-23, the measured helium permeability was 3.

cm³/sec. This required a deposit of 0.252 mil on a sample that was pumped to 0.075 torr originally. In M-Mo-18, the permeability of the control sample was tested. This sample had only 0.080 mil of molybdenum, but the sample was pumped to a vacuum of 0.001 torr before coating. For M-Mo-25, M-Mo-26, and M-Mo-28, the coated samples could be pumped to 9.001 torr, which is sufficiently low to leak test, but they leaked too much to be measured (i. e. , the permeability was greater than 7 x 10^-6 cm³/sec).

The test results are plotted in 0.2 to depict the pressure drop obtained before and after coating as a function of deposition thickness. This correlation indicates that thinner deposits are required at 700 than at 800°C, particularly on samples that will not originally pump below 0.080.

To 0.090 Torr, on samples that will pump below 0.075 Torr originally, both coatings are equally sound and less than 0.1 mil Mo is sufficient to reduce the final vacuum to the limit of the Veeco pressure gauge. 095 Torr, over 0.3 mil of molybdenum is necessary for an 800°C deposit. A 700°C deposit may be capable of sealing the samples with 0.110 Torr. If the original samples will not pump below this range, then our data indicate that they cannot be sealed with a reasonable amount of molybdenum. The validity of the plot is being checked with 20 more samples of the air-fired graphite which are on hand.

When one compares M-Mo-18 with the other samples, it is apparent that the original permeability is very important. A recent study by Cook has revealed that the 600°C air fire can open large pores in the graphite samples. These large pores may be more difficult to seal than the pores in the as-received sample. The 600°C air fire will therefore be discontinued in the hope that the argon-fired samples will have better permeability prior to coating and will thus require thinner coatings. New coating experiments on AXF graphite with an argon heat treatment will be compared with the air-treated samples to test this hypothesis.

And shallow voids being filled. An attempt was made to exert a vacuum on the inside of the graphite cylinder during deposition in an effort to pull the reacting gases into the graphite pores and possibly achieve the desired reduction in gas permeability with less molybdenum. This technique is called the differential pressure CVD coating process. The first attempts to do this were not successful because we were not able to obtain a vacuum seal around the graphite during heating and therefore pulled only a partial vacuum of 1 to 2 torrs inside the graphite sleeve. However, as shown in Fig. 3, some penetration was achieved. The Welding and Brazing Laboratory will make a braze joint between the graphite cylinder and a molybdenum tube, which should solve this problem.

A series of 700°C argon anneals were performed on selected samples of molybdenum-coated graphite to evaluate the tendency of spalling during thermal cycling and to see if the coating totally converted to a carbide. The samples were heated to 700°C for 17 hr, furnace-cooled, and then given three more 48-hr anneals at 700°C with cooling to room temperature between anneals. No tendency to spall was observed on any sample. After the final anneal, the samples examined still had 10% molybdenum carbide or less, as estimated using X-ray diffraction techniques.

We have initiated graphite irradiation experiments in the target rod positions in the core of the HFIR. This facility is being used to obtain high fluences in a relatively short time. The first two experiments, described previously, have completed a single cycle in the HFIR and have been examined.

The design utilized tungsten susceptors to compensate for the lower nuclear heating near the ends and thus obtain an axial temperature distribution of 690 to 730°C. The reactor itself is quite stable, and temperature variations over a cycle or from cycle to cycle should be less than 10°C. The results of the first series show that the peak nuclear heating was 33. 6 W/g, compared with an estimated 35 W/g.

The gradient did not follow the estimated cosine function but was slightly distorted, with a ratio of end heating to peak heating of 0. 56. Calculations based on flux monitors of stainless steel doped with cobalt indicate a flux of 1.3 x 10^15 neutrons cm^-2 sec^-1 (E > 50 keV).

The results of the first two experiments suggested a few minor design changes. These changes have been made, and two long-term experiments have been constructed and inserted in the HFIR. These experiments will be removed from the reactor after five cycles with an exposure of about 1 x 10^2 neutrons/cm (E > 50 keV). The specimens will be evaluated by measurements of physical dimensions, permeability, elastic modulus, and other physical parameters. Selected specimens will be subjected to low-angle x-ray scattering and electron microscope studies. The materials included in the two experiments are listed in Table 18. 4.

GA irradiation results. Those grades demonstrating poor irradiation resistance will be removed and replaced during the recycle periods. These four graphites are unique in that although several different starting materials were used, the physical properties and their isotropics are about the same. This will allow us to assess the effects of starting materials with a minimal change in other parameters. The Poco series is included to gain a better understanding of the exceptional dimensional stability demonstrated by this material. The coated materials were included to obtain some indication of the ability of these materials to adhere to a graphite body. The coatings were not applied by an optimized process, since our coating work is in its early stages.

Progress has been made toward the measurement of ultrasonic longitudinal (V1) and shear (V3) velocities for determining the elastic properties of proposed MSBR graphites. Longitudinal measurements have been performed with both commercial transducers with oil coupling and with thin ceramic disks bonded to the samples with Salol (phenyl salicylate). Shear crystals require a solid couplant and have been bonded with Salol. One major issue is that smooth surfaces result in mode conversion of the ultrasound and spurious reflections that make identification of the desired signals difficult.

To avoid activation in the reactor due to prior contamination by a couplant, ultrasonic measurements will be performed initially on pieces taken adjacent to the irradiation samples, and then, after exposure, on the irradiation samples themselves. About 25 of the cylinders (machined from Poco AXF and Great Lakes H315-A graphite) have been obtained for studying the uniformity of the materials and the reproducibility of bonding and measuring techniques. The anisotropy of grade H315-A was detected and may pose some problems.

Low-voltage radiographs were made for the Reactor Chemistry Division on several sections of graphite which had undergone salt impregnation testing in an irradiation field. The radiographs showed the presence of high-density material (compared with graphite) in obvious cracks and in other areas which may have been cracks oriented so that a characteristic shape could not be observed.

The variation of fracture strain at the strain rates normally encountered in tensile tests, 2 x 10^-3 to 2 min^-1, is shown in Fig. 19. 1 for a typical standard air-melted alloy in the unirradiated condition.

Only weakly influenced by the strain rate. At 500°C, the fracture strain decreases at very low strain rates due to the transition from transgranular to intergranular fracture.

The results from specimens that were irradiated in the MSRE are shown in Figure 2. At 400°C, the fracture strains are almost independent of strain rate, although the strains are slightly lower than those in Figure 1 for unirradiated materials.

Transition from transgranular to intergranular fracture; however, the transition occurs at a higher strain rate for the irradiated than for the unirradiated material. At 650°C and higher temperatures, the ductility decreases progressively as the test temperature increases. The variation in strain over the temperature range from 650 to 850°C becomes smaller as the strain rate decreases; thus, suggesting that the fracture strains at very low strain rates (creep tests) may be independent of test temperature (above 650°C). We shall later present data that indicate that this may indeed be.

Most nuclear applications expose the materials to creep conditions rather than the high strain rates encountered in tensile tests. The fracture strains for several heats of irradiated air-melted material are given in Fig. 3. The data are represented by a scatter band, but there is an obvious trend for the data from heat 5065 to fall on the lower side and that for heat 5085 on the upper side. However, the spread is much larger at high strain rates. The fracture strain is a minimum at a strain rate of about 0.1%/hr.

The fracture strains are shown as 0.4 for several vacuum melts of standard Hastelloy N. These materials seem to show a larger influence of irradiation temperature, although the scatter in the data prevents this from being an unequivocal conclusion. Generally, the material irradiated at <150°C has the higher ductility. Specimens irradiated at 650°C have fracture strains quite close to those shown in 0.3 for the air-melted heats. This observation is quite interesting since the vacuum-melted alloys have boron levels of 0.5 to 10 ppm, whereas the boron levels of the air-melted materials are as high as 50 ppm. Although there are many other differences between air- and vacuum-melted materials, our tests do not indicate that reducing the boron level alone is an effective solution to the problem of irradiation damage in this material.

We have found that modifications in the chemical composition of Hastelloy N are very effective in reducing the radiation damage. The microstructure is generally characterized by large stringers of carbide. These carbides are of the M, C type and are very high in molybdenum and contain from 2 to 5% Si. We found that the stringers were eliminated if the molybdenum content was reduced to 12 to 13% rather than the 16% normally used. However, this change alone does not seem to improve the resistance to irradiation damage.

The further modification of adding about 0.5 wt% Ti to the basic composition of Ni-7% Cr—0. 2% Mn—0.05% C was found to give additional improvement. The creep-rupture properties of two small commercial melts are shown in Fig. 5. The fracture strains are shown in Fig. 6. Again, the ductility minimum as a function of strain rate is apparent.

Ductility is not as low for the titanium-modified material and rises very sharply with strain rate above or below the value of about 0.1% per hour associated with the minimum ductility. The variation in the properties of the two titanium-modified heats is presently unexplained, although it is quite interesting that heat 21545, which has the higher boron level, has the better ductility.

Heats included are only the vacuum-melted materials. They were irradiated and tested at the same temperature—either 650 or 760°C. Although the fracture strains observed in a tensile test were quite different, the strains under creep conditions irradiated at 650°C and then tested at 650 or 760°C.

Thus, two 100-lb commercial melts containing 0.05% and 0.5% Zr were obtained. Both of these materials exhibited extensive hot cracking during Chromium 7.84% welding. 36% have been procured with titanium levels up to Tungsten 0.12% exhibited good welding characteristics and have Silicon 0.02% shown good pre- and post-irradiation properties. Cobalt 0. 07%. We have decided to continue further development Manganese 0.44% of only the titanium-modified alloy. This decision Vanadium 0. 04% is based on: (1) the poor weldability of the Phosphorus 0.12% comparatively large amount of experience that we Titanium 0. 56%.

Further large melts are necessary before we or the vendors will consider this alloy a standard production item. The next large melt to be procured will have approximately the same composition as that shown previously, with relaxed specifications on iron and manganese to allow more liberal use of scrap by the vendor.

Carbide formers such as molybdenum, chromium, and, more significantly, titanium, are expected to strengthen the alloy through precipitation reactions. In addition, however, we suspect that the beneficial effects of small titanium additions on the postirradiation ductility of these alloys are in part due to titanium-(boron, carbon) interactions which reduce the concentration of helium at the grain boundaries following neutron irradiation. Since boron and carbon should act similarly in this alloy, we have attempted to define the titanium-carbon interactions in order to better deduce the role of titanium in reducing the irradiation damage of nickel-base alloys.

Five small laboratory heats of modified Hastelloy N (Ni-12% Mo-7% Cr-0.5% Ti) were made, with titanium also included. After fabricating into 1-inch-round stock, miniature mechanical property specimens were machined and given one of three different heat treatments in argon. Samples were then creep tested in air at 650°C at stresses of.

These observations indicate that there is a pronounced strengthening effect due to titanium-carbon interactions in this alloy; however, no significant increase in creep ductility occurs at the 0.5% Ti level when compared with samples containing none.

Changes in the microstructure with increases in carbon concentration are shown in Fig. 9 for samples solution-annealed at 1177°C and aged 100 hr at 870°C. The lower carbon levels are virtually single-phase alloys, but the amount of the second phase increases significantly with increasing carbon. Heat 198, which contains 0. 04% C and no titanium, shows a large amount of finely divided precipitates that are probably M23C type. Each sample, except the 0.27% C level, was single-phase after a 1260°C heat treatment.

Creep ductility for samples tested in the solution-annealed condition; however, a small increase in ductility was found at lower stresses for samples heat-treated to precipitate the carbon prior to testing. Carbon increases the creep strength significantly, especially over the range from.

The resistivity of Hastelloy N varies with temperature in a somewhat anomalous fashion. The resistivity is decreased by cold working rather than increased, as normally noted for metals.

General behavior prevails; however, the resistivity curve is lower by about 12% for the modified alloy. 5% Ti, a decrease in the iron content from 4 to 0%, and a general decrease in residual elements such as silicon and manganese. These changes lead to a decrease in the total alloy content and hence would be expected to yield an alloy with lower resistivity. A composite set of curves is shown.

Cold working decreases the resistivity by about 15%. After a complete heating and cooling cycle, an equilibrium curve is established that is followed during subsequent cycles. Annealing the material for 1 hr at 1177°C reduces the resistivity slightly, but the equilibrium curve is followed after the first heating. The resistivity changes over a normal operating range of 25 to 700°C are quite small, only 4%. Phase Identification Studies in Hastelloy N. We are continuing our investigation into the characterization of precipitated phases occurring in Hastelloy N. As we reported previously, the microstructure of standard Hastelloy N is characterized by stringers of blocky M, C carbides after annealing in the temperature range 1177 to 1260°C. After aging and/or testing at temperatures between 427 and 871°C, a fine dendritic grain-boundary precipitate is generated, which coarsens with increasing aging temperature and with increasing times at the lower temperatures.

Errors are inherent in the techniques involved, and the results are only semi-quantitative. The blocky, or stringer, morphology approximately fits the stoichiometric Ni, Mo, C carbide, whereas the grain-boundary morphology corresponds closely to.

It is possible that the high-temperature phase in the 1C material is not the same phase as that formed in the commercial heats because conventional microprobe analysis of the high-temperature phase in standard Hastelloy N differs markedly from the above results (see Table 19. 1), and because Mo, C-type carbides have not been observed in specimens from standard alloys which were annealed at high temperature.

In air-melted heats of Hastelloy N, the large carbides do not go into solid solution, even at high annealing temperatures; but appear to melt and transform to a lamellar phase between 1260 and 1316°C. However, in vacuum-melted heats, the precipitates do go into solution, and the high-temperature phase is not formed.

Carbon-14 specimen annealed at 1177°C and aged 100 hr at 649°C shows activity at precipitates and in grain boundaries. (a) Lightly etched. Specimen with NTB-2 autoradiographic emulsion, exposed. The precipitates go into solution after annealing the low-silicon heats at temperatures of 1260 to 1371°C, whereas those in the high-silicon heats melt and transform to the high-temperature phase seen in Fig. 14. The major compositional difference between the air and vacuum-melted alloys is the silicon concentration.

To evaluate the effect of silicon on precipitation, several alloys of nominal composition (16 Mo, 7 Cr, 4 Fe, etc. ) with silicon concentrations of 0. 02 were studied. These data are shown in Table 19. 2. The amount of M. C. -type precipitates increases noticeably; however, many are present in the low-silicon heats after annealing at 1177°C. The as-cast structure is retained somewhat in the 0. 48% Si heat, greatly in the 1% alloy. We extracted precipitates from a specimen of 1% Si which had been annealed at 1260°C, using a direct carbon extraction replica (. 15). The H. E. McCoy, Influence of Several Metallurgical Variables on the Tensile Properties of Hastelloy N, with these particles. In contrast, very little precipitate is found in grain boundaries of standard.

Hastelloy N. Selected area electron diffraction indicates that the film precipitate has essentially the same lattice parameter as the M,C-type carbides found in the standard alloy. X-ray diffraction powder patterns confirm this observation, and long exposures fail to show any diffraction lines other than those associated with the M,C-type carbide. Microprobe analysis of these extracted particles using the electron microscope microprobe accessory resulted in a composition similar to the blocky carbides present in the commercial material with the exception of silicon, which exists in concentrations up to about 5%.

We know that the M, C-type precipitates in standard Hastelloy N are rich in silicon. We have not been able to correlate the M, C-type particles with carbon, but their be.

Behavior is sensitive to silicon concentration in the in 16, as well as some larger precipitates, alloy. Both the blocky and grain boundary pre- is actually of the Mo, C type; the major phase precipitates are rich in silicon and increasingly so present. The available information suggests that the silicon may occupy carbon positions with the lattice parameter not being changed significantly. If silicon were to occupy all carbon sites, about 5. 2% Si could be accommodated.

We have identified fine grain-boundary precipitates which occur in titanium-modified Hastelloy N after annealing at 1177 and 871°C. It was previously reported that the thin-film morphology was probably face-centered cubic TiC, and the particles a noncubic precipitate.

Electron diffraction also shows that the small particles associated with this film, as well as the needle-like morphology, have a face-centered cubic lattice parameter of 4.24 Å, similar to the values reported for TiN. X-ray diffraction shows a slightly expanded (4. 26–4. The amount of this phase is quite small compared with the amount of Mo2C present.

These studies have shown that standard Hastelloy N, annealed at 1177°C, contains large M-Ae carbides that are rich in molybdenum. Aging causes the precipitation of fine M6C particles along the boundaries. All the M6C particles studied are enriched in silicon. A series of special alloys revealed that the concentration of silicon in the precipitate increased as the silicon content of the alloy increased. This segregation of silicon to these precipitates is probably responsible for the localized melting that occurs when this alloy is heated to about 1300°C. Carbon-14 studies show that this product is not a carbide, but an identification has not been made. The titanium-modified Hastelloy N was found to have small amounts of grain-boundary precipitates of the Mo2C type and also a complex face-centered.

Experiments and service in the MSRE have demonstrated the excellent corrosion resistance of Hastelloy N in fluoride salt systems. Our radiation damage studies have shown that the resistance of this alloy to radiation damage can be improved markedly by the addition of about 0.5% Ti. Titanium forms a very stable fluoride, and we are.

Concerned with whether this element would increase the corrosion rate.

The data was used to predict the maximum rate of titanium diffusion out of Hastelloy N under steady-state corrosion conditions. This occurs for the case where the titanium concentration at the surface in contact with the salt is maintained constant at zero. The appropriate solution of Fick's second law of diffusion is then.

Using Equation (2) and experimental values of the diffusion coefficient D, we have calculated titanium concentration distributions that would result after cm/sec. However, since this value is for volume diffusion, one might argue that the effective diffusivity, which includes the effect of short-circuit diffusion paths, might be as much as an order of magnitude larger than the extrapolated value. Thus, a value for D of 5 x 10^-15 cm/sec has been used in our calculations for 700°C. The measured value at 800°C was 2 x 10^-14 cm/sec. The latter value corresponds roughly to the effective chromium diffusion rate in Hastelloy N at 650°C.

The depth of the diffusion zone from which titanium is depleted from the alloy increases with both increasing time and increasing temperature. Table 19. 3 lists the depth at which the titanium concentration is about 95% of its original value. For the maximum probable coefficient at 700°C (i. e. , 5 x 10^15), the depleted zone after 30 years (approximately 250,000 hr) extends only over a distance of approximately 60 μm from the surface of the alloy.

Using this equation and various values of D and t, we calculated the expected buildup in solute concentration in the salt of a typical system such as the MSRE. The total surface area was assumed to be 852 ft², and the total amount of molten salt 4. 92 x 10⁶ g. The results are shown in Table 19.4. At 800°C, the amount of titanium removed would be approximately 169 g after 30 years, which is the equivalent of only 30 ppm increase in the salt concentration. At 700°C, the comparable values would be 84 g of titanium.

We conclude from these studies that the addition of titanium to Hastelloy N has not affected the corrosion resistance of the alloy. Because of the lower rate of titanium diffusion and the lower concentration of titanium present, the selective removal of chromium will continue to be the primary corrosion process in this alloy in molten fluoride salts.

We are continuing to study the effects of welding conditions and post-weld heat treatment on the distribution and level of the residual stresses in Hastelloy N.

The technique used for machining the specimens has been modified slightly from that previously reported. A lathe was substituted for the milling machine previously used. The cutting tool is fixed more rigidly, resulting in an improved cut with more uniform quality and reduced work hardening. Large volumes of cutting fluid are now used for both lubricating and cooling. The temperature of the welded specimen is monitored, and a thermocouple placed near the strain gauges showed a maximum temperature rise during machining of about 3°C. The normal lathe chucking technique welded specimen is bolted to a Micarta bed.

A way that will prevent them from being damaged. To accomplish this, the wires are fed through the hollow lathe shaft and connected to silver-coated plugs. During machining, these plugs are held in a manner that permits their rotating with the shaft. After a cut is completed, the lathe is stopped, and the plugs are connected to the strain-measuring unit. After the reading is taken, the plugs are disconnected, and the next cut is made.

The tangential residual stress (with respect to the weld axis) is a function of the change of the tangential strain with the radius, that is, de/dR, where ε is the gauge reading in microinches per inch and where R is the value of the radius of the cut in inches. In order to evaluate de/dR, it is necessary to fit the experimental readings of strain and radius with a continuous function. The curve fitting and evaluation of the slope at various values of R are done by a computer. The tangential stresses are evaluated as a function of location across the weldment. The radial stresses are determined mathematically from the longitudinal strain data. These calculations have also been.

The computer printout curves show the distribution of radial and tangential stresses across the welds of specimens 1, 5, and 6. From an analysis of the welds made without post-weld heat treatment, it appears that the maximum tangential stress occurs about % in. from the weld axis toward the disk center. Using helium as the arc shielding gas, the peak stress was found to be approximately 61,000 psi. It appears that the stress gradient across the weld is steeper for argon than for helium. This probably results from the hotter and wider weld puddle which characterizes welds made under helium.

Two post-weld heat treatments were also considered (specimens 5 and 6). Sample 5 was given a full anneal at 1177°C for 1 hr, while sample 6 was heated for 6 hr at 871°C, a standard stress relief for Hastelloy N. Both treatments reduced the residual welding stress to extremely low values.

The stress; the 871°C treatment left a maximum of about 5000 psi in the weld deposit. From these results, it appears that the heat treatment at 871°C for 6 hr is indeed beneficial. The difference in stress distribution between argon and helium welds is also noteworthy.

A thick Hastelloy N plate has been received from Battelle Memorial Institute (BMI). Battelle was supplied with a 1-inch-thick plate of MSRE grade Hastelloy N and a 25-foot coil of 0.125-inch-diameter Hastelloy N weld wire. Due to the needs of the NGW process, it was necessary to reduce the wire diameter to 0. 045 inches. Problems were encountered by BMI during processing, and only 7 lbs of usable wire was finally obtained.

The NGW process is a proprietary process developed by BMI. It is basically a metal-arc inert gas process, wherein welding is done at the bottom of a narrow gap formed by the root faces of the two materials being joined. The process has the advantages that it requires no edge preparation and the amount of filler metal needed to fill the joint.

Operationally, the two plates to be joined are placed about 4 inches apart. Two torches, slightly out of alignment (within the allowable 4-inch dimension), are employed. The second torch trails the first by about 2 inches. The lay of the weld wires is oriented so that each tends to deposit its bead toward the wall nearest it. The process permits low-heat-input welds, which, owing to the narrow joint, result in the fabrication being completed with a minimum number of passes.

Three welds were made during the course of the investigation. Only the first weldment was made under the normal twin-wire—narrow-gap technique. Center-line cracking occurred in the trailing weld bead after about half the plate thickness had been welded.

It was found that an 80 He–20 Ar atmosphere produced the best weld bead; one with a reduced capillary and no long columnar grains. Special precautions were taken with the filler wire prior to welding, the interpass temperature, and the condition of the surface. This weld was also unsatisfactory since it contained large blowholes and a number of cracks and fissures.

Parameters of these test units. Since last year, we have utilized a newly designed natural circulation loop. The device is essentially a test bed system wherein metal specimens suspended in the salt and salt samples can be removed and/or replaced at the operating temperature without disturbing flow or introducing air contamination. This design makes it possible to obtain kinetic data on corrosion and to study corrosion mechanisms prior to dismantling and subjecting an entire loop to metallurgical analysis. Figure 19. 19 shows a schematic of the new loop configuration, while Figure 20 displays two loops, NCL-15 and -16, in a protective hood prior to operation.

Loop 1258, constructed of type 304L stainless steel and containing the same salt as loop 1255, has operated for about 4. 6 years with only minor changes in flow characteristics. In January 1967, ten new stainless steel specimens were placed in the hot leg of loop 1258. The specimen in the hottest position was replaced after 3700 hours. A plot of the weight change of all the specimens as a function of time and temperature is given in Fig. 19. 21. The curves are rather typical of corrosion processes that are diffusion-controlled.

As expected, the weight loss is highest at the hottest point in the loop and decreases with decreasing temperature. Salt analyses show that only chromium is leached from the metal, and a diffusion coefficient can be calculated from Eq. (1) by assuming that the rate-controlling process is the diffusion.

Assuming a surface chromium concentration of zero, the calculated values for D at 649 and 677°C. The diffusion coefficient for chromium in austenitic stainless steel at 677°C was extrapolated from existing data as 4 x 10-13 cm/sec.

There are several possible reasons why these values do not agree. (1) The measured values were obtained over the temperature range from 849 to 1398°C and extrapolated to 677°C. Short-circuit diffusion mechanisms have been shown to be effective at lower temperatures and lead to a deviation in the standard Arrhenius plot used for extrapolation. (2) A corrosion mechanism more complicated than leaching of chromium from stainless steel is involved. We are continuing to investigate these factors in an effort to explain the differences above.

Loop NCL-16, the first two-fluid MSBR fuel salt natural circulation loop incorporating the new loop configuration, is now operating. The weight change obtained after 250 hours on the titanium-modified Hastelloy N specimen at 704°C was 0. 35 mg/cm.

In support of the MSRP fuel processing scheme using vacuum distillation, we have fabricated a TZM alloy capsule that will contain LiF-BeF2 (88-12 mole %). This composition is typical of the salt distilland expected during processing. The test will be run at 1093°C, the approximate distillation temperature. This temperature precludes the use of nickel-base alloys, and thus the molybdenum-base alloy TZM has been selected as a candidate retort material.

Loop NCL 15 is now operating with a typical two-fluid MSBR blanket salt. Considerable difficulty was experienced in filling this loop. The salt seemed to have an exaggerated tendency toward incongruent melting and segregation during solidification. The weight change obtained after 400 hr on the titanium-modified Hastelloy N specimen at 677°C was 0.05 mg/cm². This figure is lower than that for any other loop we have studied recently. It is again emphasized that these data are preliminary, since the loop has not reached a steady state.

Identical conditions. Loop NCL 13 contains standard Hastelloy N specimens, while loop NCL 14 has titanium-modified Hastelloy N specimens suspended in the salt stream. These differences make possible an excellent comparison of the effect of fluoroborate salt on these alloys. Utilizing weight changes on the specimens, changes in fluoroborate salt chemistry, and assuming loop behavior and specimen behavior are the same at a given temperature, a mass balance of the system was obtained within 10%.

A profile of the weight change of loop NCL 13 at various times is given in 0.22. It can be seen that there are two positions (balance points) at 520 ± 15°C which have not changed weight as a function of time. One of these points is located in the upper crossover section, and the other in the lower portion of the hot leg.

Balance points, we estimate that about 55% of the loop is gaining weight, and the remainder is losing weight. The change in chromium and iron content in the salt with time is plotted in Fig. 23. At the end of this reporting period, 2200 hr exposure time, about 1500 mg of material has been lost from the metal. Approximately half of this stayed in the salt, and the other half deposited in the cold portions of the loop.

Of AC, at Calculated using Eq. (2), was 150 ppm Cr, in excellent agreement with the experiment. This suggests that a loop fabricated from modified Hastelloy N should behave like our test specimens of the same material. Proof of this thesis will be studied as modified material becomes available for construction of a loop.

It was found that by using the weight changes and the combined iron and chromium concentration for the loop specimens, almost identical D values were obtained for the standard and modified Hastelloy N. Thus D, or in reality a rate constant K, is independent of the concentration of chromium and iron and other diffusing species. The weight change, however, is quite sensitive to the total concentration of the migrating elements. Confirmation of this hypothesis is evident when comparing K from our loops with a value obtained for D in Hastelloy N.

We believe the sodium fluoroborate salts may be less selective in their dissolution tendency of the major elements in nickel- and iron-based alloys. However, it is emphasized that the corrosion rates of Hastelloy N in fluoroborate salts are relatively small and now appear to be leveling off. This behavior increases our confidence in the compatibility of Hastelloy-N in candidate salts for.

Capsule tests to evaluate the compatibility of Hastelloy N with fluoroborate salts at 607°C as a function of BF pressure have operated for 800 hours through February. There are four capsules with three titanium-modified Hastelloy N specimens in each; one specimen is in the salt, one in the BF. The pressures used are approximately 130 torrs (the normal BF vapor pressure at 607°C), 50, 100, and 400 psig. The time, originally scheduled for 1000 hours, has been extended to 2000 hours to permit gathering of more conclusive results. We have observed that the specimens in the vapor phase of loops NCL 13 and NCL 14 continue to lose weight and retain a blackened appearance. These capsule tests should shed light on this phenomenon.

Work is in progress on a loop facility that will enable us to study the compatibility of alloys and salts under forced-circulation conditions of interest to the MSRP. At present, we are constructing a test facility for studying the compatibility of Hastelloy N with NaBF4-NaF (92-8 mole%). The loop, MSR-FCL-1, will operate at a bulk maximum temperature of 607°C with a temperature difference of 150°C. This salt is very attractive as a coolant because of its low cost and low melting point. If found to be compatible and satisfactory in other respects, it will be used in the MSRE in place of the present coolant, LiF-BeF2 (66-34 mole%).

Liquid velocities will be limited to 7 fps because an available model LFB pump is being used. Other salient features of the loop include a BF purging and addition system over the free liquid surface in the pump tank, means for sampling molten salt during operation, and permanent metallurgical specimens installed in the bulk stream. The salt in the loop will be heated by electrical resistance heating of the tubing wall and will be cooled by a finned air-cooled heat exchanger. Special controls are provided to reduce the possibilities of freezing the salt in the loop piping during electrical power interruptions or other equipment failures. The loop is shown in a simplified scheme.

Expected temperature profile of the liquid and the metal wall. Selected engineering data for the loop design are given in Table 19. 9. The data given are the design conditions, but uncertainties in the physical properties of the salt may cause the actual operating conditions to be different.

To be formed at the peak temperature, this oxide may spall during cooling due to a difference between the thermal expansion of the oxide and the metal substrate. We used a cycle period of 25 hours in our tests (i. e. , 25 hours at temperature), after which the specimens were removed from the furnace, allowed to cool to room temperature, weighed, and reinserted in the furnace. The test times were generally 1000 hours, with the samples being weighed periodically. Test temperatures of 760 and 982°C were studied. The test specimens were 4 inches in diameter by 1 inch long. The materials studied are given in the table.

Alloys were made by air and vacuum melting and contain various amounts of Fe, Al, Mn, and Si. However, the variation in silicon appears to be most important, with the weight loss at 982°C varying by a factor of about 6 over the range of 0 to 0. 6 wt%. At 760°C, a similar trend is noted, although about 0.05% Si seems sufficient to improve the oxidation resistance appreciably.

Several 2-lb laboratory melts of the modified base composition (12% Mo—7% Cr—0.2% Mn—0. 05% C) were prepared with various amounts of titanium. The results of tests on this material are shown in. 28. These melts are all quite low in silicon, and the weight losses are quite similar to those shown in. 27 for the low-silicon alloys. The titanium additions seem to decrease the weight loss slightly, the effect being greater.

The corrected text: "are slightly lower than those shown in 0. 28, probably because of the higher concentration of beneficial impurities in the commercial alloys. These results indicate that the removal of silicon and other residuals from the alloy is more detrimental to the oxidation resistance than the addition of small amounts of titanium. The weight losses experienced at 760°C are still relatively low for such stringent conditions (e. g. , a weight loss of 100 mg/in. in 1000 hr corresponds to the loss of about 50 mils of metal in 10,000 hr). Isothermal oxidation tests are being run on these materials, and the rates are much lower."

The graphite used in these tests was high-density, low-permeability isotropic material made by Poco. The joints were brazed with copper and pulled at room temperature. Figure 20. 3 shows one of the broken test specimens. The position of fracture varied from specimen to specimen. This was taken as an indication of the extent of cracking due to differential thermal expansion in the plane of the taper. In addition, one specimen fractured at the metal-graphite junction during the brazing cycle. Thus, more severe stresses than anticipated were encountered with this particular test specimen design.

Experimental results on full-size joints (6% in. OD, 1/8-in. wall) are preliminary. Most of the tests were direct joints of Hastelloy N to pyrolytic-coated graphite using copper as the brazing filler metal. Both induction and furnace brazing techniques were used. The induction-brazing technique is quite attractive in view of the large number of joints needed and the length and uniform configuration of the reactor components. Induction brazing experiments have resulted in the fracture of the graphite at the graphite-Hastelloy N junction.

During a relatively fast cool down from the brazing temperature, uniform heating has been difficult to obtain, and as a result, we found portions of these joints containing unmelted brazing filler metal. We are presently upgrading the induction brazing unit to minimize these problems. Several direct joints of various designs have also been furnace brazed. Again, the direct joints between graphite and Hastelloy N cracked in all cases, although not to the extent that the induction-brazed joints did. This experience indicates the potential advantages of the low-expansion transition metal concept. For example, a brazed graphite-to-molybdenum joint showed no visual or radiographic evidence of cracking. Figure 20.

The microstructure of such a joint (note the excellent flow of the copper filler metal). Next, a piece of Hastelloy N will be brazed to the molybdenum to form the complete transition joint, and then the entire joint will be thermally cycled.

Strength data for the reactor and control specimens are shown in Table 20. 2. It can be seen that all the brazing filler metals seem to have adequate mechanical strength for nuclear system joints. We cannot obtain quantitative values for the shear strains until the width of the sheared region is determined. Complete analysis of the data must await the test results from the specimens having the same thermal history as them.

Work was initiated to develop a transition joint for joining graphite to Hastelloy N. The transition joint concept is an attractive solution to the problem of joining materials of widely differing thermal coefficients of expansion, and consists of inserting a series of connected segments whose properties change gradually from one component of the juncture to the other. The segments are usually fabricated by powder metallurgy and are joined by diffusion bonding or brazing. The constituents of the joint should be metallurgically compatible with one another under the fabrication and service conditions.

There are two widely differing properties of graphite and Hastelloy N which give concern: the coefficient of thermal expansion and the dimensional stability under irradiation. Both can produce damaging strain at the joint interface; the former being of concern while cooling from the brazing temperature and during thermal cycling, and the latter being of concern during prolonged irradiation of the graphite member.

Two families of materials exist which offer unique characteristics for designing the type of link we require. One is the familiar class of heavy-metal alloys of tungsten or molybdenum with a nickel alloy as the binder constituent, which is fabricated by liquid-phase sintering.

Top: Array of segments comprising the joint, showing transitions in properties. Middle: Transition in irradiation-induced dimensional instability of graphite-carbide composite segments.

Preliminary fabrication studies were conducted on tungsten heavy-metal alloys to confirm the good sinterability and ductility experienced with this class of materials in other quarters. By achieving microstructures wherein a ductile nickel phase surrounds the otherwise fragile tungsten grains, exceptionally ductile composites have been obtained. As indicated in Table 20.

We extended our studies to include alloys based on molybdenum because they are expected to show superior resistance to embrittlement by irradiation. The important consideration here is that at the service temperature (around 700°C), fast displacement damage would anneal out of the molybdenum but possibly not out of tungsten. 4, specimens 4 to 11).

The observation that these molybdenum heavy-metal alloys were prone to be brittle, whereas the tungsten alloys were not, is explained by comparing the nickel-molybdenum and nickel-tungsten phase diagrams. On cooling mixtures of molybdenum and nickel, which have been heated at the liquid-phase sintering temperature (just above 1453°C), a eutectic containing the brittle intermetallic compound NiMo forms. This happened for the 90% Mo—7% Ni—3% Fe alloy (specimen 4 of Table 20. 4) and gave a very brittle alloy.

The problem of developing suitable molybdenum-heavy metal alloys thus resolves into one of finding additives to molybdenum-nickel that suppress the intermetallic-forming reaction sufficiently to preclude brittle alloys while at the same time ensuring good fabricability. Palladium, platinum, copper, and tungsten were selected for examination—palladium, platinum, and copper as soluble matrix phase additions and tungsten as a molybdenum displacement additive.

The tungsten additive greatly reduced the amount of intermetallic in the alloys, but some of this phase still remained (specimens 5 to 8 of Table 20.4). Also, these compacts, when containing the larger amounts of binder constituent, had very narrow sintering temperature ranges.

But palladium and copper (specimens 10 and 11) gave the desired continuous-matrix-type structures free of any discernible intermetallics. However, Pd (wt%), was unexpectedly brittle. Since palladium has a rather high affinity for hydrogen, this may have been caused by having sintered in hydrogen as an atmosphere.

These preliminary results on heavy-metal alloys are encouraging, and we feel that the transition joint approach to joining graphite to Hastelloy N will prove practicable. Also, cursory evaluations will be made of graphite-carbide composites.

We are developing nondestructive testing techniques to detect unbond in various designs of graphite-to-metal joints. Our preliminary studies indicate that an acceptable pulse-echo ultrasonic method can be developed for certain joint configurations. Mechanical scanning is a problem for the joint designs with which we have been working. We assembled a turntable device to use.

We were able to demonstrate that the ultrasonic method (using the turntable scanning device) could distinguish bond and nonbond on one joint design. The ultrasonic data indicated that bonding was accomplished on only one area of the total joint. The destructive test of this joint resulted in the separation of the graphite material in the bonded area. Figure 20. 7 shows that result.

Dent, only one portion of the joint, the dark area, was bonded, coinciding with the prediction based on the ultrasonic examination. These results demonstrate the feasibility of the ultrasonic pulse-echo method for this particular joint configuration. No attempt has been made to determine the optimum sensitivity to nonbonding.

A second joint design we have been working with is a tensile specimen with the graphite-to-metal joint in the gauge length. The maximum diameter of the specimen is 1.00 in. , and the joint is a 30° cone, so that the joint diameter varies from 1 in. to a point. The graphite comprises the male part of the joint, and the Hastelloy N comprises the female part. Since both the radius of curvature of the joint and the area that reflects the ultrasonic energy change with the diameter, calibration is a problem because we encounter variations in the reflected signal as the diameter changes even for a complete nonbond. A further complication is the changing metal thickness from the outer surface of the specimen to the joint interface as the joint diameter changes. Attempts to evaluate this joint with the pulse-echo ultrasonic method have been unsuccessful thus far. However, we feel that it is possible to tolerate some variation in our test, and we plan to pursue this technique when modifications on our mechanical system are completed. Other joint designs to be fabricated will also require investigation by NDT evaluation techniques. These needs are being coordinated closely with the Welding and Brazing.

The Metals and Ceramics Division and the Reactor Division are engaged in a joint program for investigating and developing a welding process for automated remote maintenance of the MSBR. Most work so far has been in the form of literature surveys and contacts with automatic equipment manufacturers and users. Automated remote cutting and welding have been done at several facilities in the United States, and information from these programs is beneficial to us. Most of the applicable work has been conducted using the gas-tungsten arc.

Gas-tungsten arc welding processes have been demonstrated adequately for this alloy. The primary problem lies in adapting the techniques to remote operation. This is not true for the gas-metal arc process, which has been used very little in the welding of Hastelloy N. Hence, we have in progress a modest effort to adapt this potentially desirable process to Hastelloy N. Test plates have been machined, and filler wire is being fabricated and spooled for use in these studies.

Since the maintenance may involve the welding of highly irradiated (with consequent low ductility) Hastelloy N, we plan to conduct welding studies on some irradiated creep specimens. If weld cracking appears to be serious, various approaches will be investigated to obtain a suitable joint.

The development work on processes for molten salt breeder reactors has undergone a significant change in direction during this reporting period. The change resulted from the recognition and acceptance of reductive extraction as a feasible and attractive basis for processes to isolate protactinium from the reactor and, possibly, to remove fission products. A protactinium isolation flowsheet based on reductive extraction now appears applicable to a one-fluid breeder reactor. This processing development, along with the recognition that good breeding performance can be achieved with a single-fluid system, has changed the direction of the reactor development and hence has redirected the development of chemical processing methods away from a two-fluid concept.

This section includes the presentation of some of the data on reductive extraction, which lends credit to its feasibility and the calculational analysis of some proposed flowsheets with alternatives.

Our participation in the activities of the Molten Salt Reactor Experiment during its shutdown in March 1968 will include recovery of the 735U from the present fuel salt, processing this salt to remove chromium and corrosion products, delivery of a prepared charge of 793UF4-LiF eutectic for refueling the reactor, and distillation of 48 liters of MSRE carrier salt in an experimental vacuum still.

Evaluation of reductive extraction methods for the processing of molten-salt breeder reactor fuels is being continued. The process now under study involves the selective extraction of uranium, protactinium, and rare earths from the molten salt using liquid lithium-bismuth solutions. Originally, the main effort was devoted to the processing of.

Work on the MSBR has indicated that uranium and protactinium can probably be separated and recovered from a single-fluid MSBR salt. Furthermore, a preliminary evaluation showed that it should be possible to engineer such a process. Consequently, most of the current effort is directed toward the development of processing methods for single-fluid MSBR fuels. In order to obtain a more detailed evaluation of these methods, accurate distribution coefficients for uranium, thorium, and the rare earths must be determined. Our program is, therefore, designed to provide these data.

Data obtained on the distribution of several solutes between the two-fluid MSBR fuel salt, LiF-BeF2 (66-34 mole %), and lithium-bismuth solutions are as follows: 2 for lithium and sodium, 3 for europium, 3 for lanthanum, and 4 for uranium. Average AE values (Table 22.1) are provided at those temperatures where more than one distribution coefficient was obtained.

The values obtained for lanthanum and europium are in reasonable agreement with those reported by Moulton and Shaffer. However, our value for uranium at 600°C, based on three data points, this difference is inexplicable at present. It is interesting to note that the AE values appear to be practically constant over the temperature range from 500 to 700°C. If AE is constant, plots of log Q vs 1/T should be linear (see Eq. 4).

The data for europium and lanthanum are shown in Table 22. 1; the lines were placed using average values of AE of 0. 43 and 0. 30 for lanthanum and europium respectively. Although Moulton's data for cerium give a very good straight line over the temperature range from 500 to 700°C, the data points are highly scattered. It does appear that Q decreases with increasing temperature. This dependence of Q on temperature shows that the rare earths are less easily extracted at the higher temperatures.

The data given in Tables 22.1 and 22.2 show that uranium can easily be removed from the fuel salt of a two-fluid MSBR by reductive extraction. Furthermore, separation from the rare earths is very good. At 600°C, the separation factors (Dₒᵧ/Dₑᵧ) are at least 1000. The data also show that, once the uranium has been extracted, the rare earths can be removed from the salt by increasing the lithium concentration in the metal phase.

Two experiments involving the equilibration of simulated single-fluid MSBR fuel salt with lithium-bismuth solutions at 600°C have been completed. An equal volume of bismuth was heated in a mild steel crucible under argon to 600°C. Then, lithium (as Li-Be alloy) was added to the bismuth in small increments, and the equilibrium distribution of the various components between the two phases was determined.

In which C is the lithium concentration in the metal phase (at. %). This equation was obtained by visually fitting what appeared to be the best line of slope 4 through the points in the lithium. The analyses were the most accurate. These data are shown in 0. 2. The distribution coefficients obtained using LiF-BeF2 (66-34 mole %) as the salt phase are included for comparison.

Stated were about 0. 014 for both thorium and europium, and less than 0. 07 for lanthanum; the lanthanum concentration in the metal phase was always less than 4 ppm. The data indicate that the solubility of thorium in bismuth is markedly depressed by the presence of uranium and/or lithium since the solubility of thorium in pure bismuth at 600°C.

The data presented above show that uranium can be easily extracted from single-fluid MSBR salt, leaving thorium and rare earths in the salt. The separation factors (D11/D22 and D11/D12) are at least 10. These data also show, by extrapolation to low lithium concentrations, that the rare earths can probably be separated from thorium.

It has been noted previously that during reductive extraction experiments, up to 75% of the lithium added to the system was consumed in an inexplicable manner. In most of these experiments, the lithium was added as the pure metal. The results of our latest experiments show that this problem can be largely eliminated when the lithium is added to the system as pieces of frozen lithium-bismuth alloy. An example of the equivalent balances that can be achieved by this method (Fig. 22. 3) was derived from data obtained in an experiment in which LiF-BeF2-UF4 was added periodically. The first 10 meq of lithium added was probably consumed in reactions with BeF2, OH-, and other.

Easily reduced species that were present in the salt. Then, as more lithium-bismuth alloy was added, the lithium was consumed by reduction of uranium fluoride from the salts. The consumption of lithium was nearly stoichiometric for the reaction.

Laboratory experiments have shown that protactinium and uranium can be extracted into bismuth from molten salt which contains fluorides of lithium, beryllium, and thorium by using metallic thorium as the reductant. In the proposed flowsheet (1), a salt stream from the reactor enters the bottom of the extraction column and flows countercurrently to a stream of bismuth containing reduced metals. Ideally, the metal stream entering the top of the column contains sufficient thorium and lithium to extract only the uranium entering the column. The system exploits the fact that protactinium is less noble than uranium but more noble than thorium. Hence.

In the lower part of the column, uranium is preferentially extracted from the incoming salt, while the protactinium progresses farther up the column to where it is reduced by thorium. In this manner, protactinium refluxes in the center of the column, and relatively high protactinium concentrations result.

The metal phase containing the uranium extracted in the column can serve as the cell anode, where uranium and lithium will be oxidized to UF4 and LiF. Salt from the top of the extraction column serves as the cell electrolyte and first passes over a pool of liquid bismuth, which serves as the cathode into which thorium and lithium are.

Typical performance of the protactinium isolation system is shown in Fig. 2 for a case which will be taken as the reference case. The minimum reactor protactinium concentration is obtained when the bismuth flow rate is just sufficient to extract the uranium entering the system. At slightly higher bismuth rates, protactinium will also be extracted, since it is the next component in order of decreasing nobility.

Muth rates slightly lower than the optimum rate; some uranium will not be extracted. This uranium, and most of the protactinium, will flow out the top of the column. In either case, some protactinium is allowed to return to the reactor, and the effectiveness of the system is diminished. For bismuth flow rates higher than the optimum, the reactor protactinium concentration increases from the minimum value of 22 ppm at the rate of 28 ppm for each percent increase in metal flow rate for the conditions of this particular case. Similar effects would be produced by variations in salt flow rate or in the total concentration of reduced metals (equivalents of reduced metals per mole of bismuth) fed to.

The concentration of uranium in the salt decreases from the reactor concentration of 3 x 10^7 mole fraction to 6.3 x 10^-5 mole fraction at the inlet to the protactinium decay tank, whereas the protactinium concentration increases from the reactor.

The decay tank, the uranium, and protactinium concentrations decrease steadily to negligible values. The flowsheet has several very desirable characteristics, which include a negligible holdup of fissile 753 in the processing plant, an almost immediate return of newly produced U-4 to the reactor system, and a closed system which prevents.

Includes loss of protactinium, 73U, or other components of the reactor fuel salt; however, the protactinium removal efficiency is undesirably sensitive to minor variations in operating conditions such as salt or bismuth flow rate and concentration of reduced metals in the bismuth stream fed to the extraction column. Methods for making system performance less sensitive to minor variations in operating conditions have been considered.

The average reactor protactinium concentration is shown in Figure 4 as a function of the standard deviation in bismuth flow rate for cases with stabilization by uranium removal as well as for two cases with no uranium removal which have protactinium processing cycle times of three days (reference case) and one day. For a standard deviation of 0. 35% of FMB (optimum bismuth flow rate), the minimum reactor protactinium concentration (22 ppm) is obtained if the fraction of uranium removed from the inlet to the decay tank is 2% or greater. With no uranium removal, the average concentration is 38.5 ppm.

A concentration of 24.5 ppm is obtained. In choosing the optimum protactinium isolation system having a one-day processing system, the relative costs associated with higher cycle time with no uranium removal produce processing rates with closer process control.

Roughly the same average reactor protactinium with increased uranium removal must be considered as a system having a three-day cycle time as well as the value of obtaining a given 1% removal of uranium from the average reactor protactinium concentration.

Uranium present in the fuel stream of an MSBR must be removed prior to the distillation step since UF6 would not be completely volatilized during this operation. Equipment is being developed for the continuous removal of UF6 from a salt stream by countercurrently contacting the salt with F2 in a salt-phase-continuous system. The equipment will be protected from corrosion by freezing a layer of salt on the vessel wall. The heat necessary for maintaining molten salt adjacent to frozen salt will be provided by the decay of fission products in the salt stream. Recent development work has been directed toward demonstrating operability of a frozen-wall fluorinator using countercurrent flow of molten salt and an inert gas.

The experimental equipment consisted of a 5-in. -diameter, 8-ft-high column fabricated from schedule 40 nickel pipe. An internal heat source consisting of three Calrod heaters contained in a 3-in. -diameter schedule 40 Inconel pipe is used to simulate a volume heat source in the molten salt. Two sets of internal thermocouples located near the center of each of two test sections indicated the radial temperature gradient, from which one could infer the location of the interface between molten and frozen salt. Each test section was independently cooled by air flowing through spirally wound 1/8-in. -diameter nickel tubing. Additional Calrod heaters were wound on the external surface of the fluorinator to provide auxiliary heat during heatup and to provide control of temperatures at the ends of the column. A 66-34 mole % LiF-ZiF2 mixture, which has a liquidus of 595°C and a phase diagram similar to the LiF-BeF2 System, was metered from the feed tank for periods as long as 5 hr, which allowed collection of data for a 1- to 2-hr period of steady-state operation.

The principal objective of the experiments demonstrating that a layer of frozen salt could be formed and maintained under approximate operating conditions was achieved. Experimental conditions are compared in Table 24. 1 with reference conditions for a fluorinator having a salt throughput of 15 ft³/day and an inlet uranium concentration of 0. 8 kg per cubic foot of salt with a 50% F.

In general, the frozen wall thickness and temperature profiles in the frozen salt were in good agreement with the values predicted by relations obtained by assuming purely radial heat flow from a volume heat source. Frozen wall thickness generation in the layer of frozen salt was not simulated in these experiments.

The thermal conductivity of the frozen salt was calculated for each run from the experimentally determined temperature gradient and the measured heat flux. The relative agreement of calculated values was taken to be indicative of consistency of the experimental data. Thermal conductivities calculated from the upper test section data were closely grouped around 0. 75 Btu/hr-ft-°F; however, values from the lower section were more widely scattered and were generally about 100%.

Protection of the fluorine inlet nozzle from corrosion is an anticipated problem associated with the operation of a frozen-wall fluorinator. A possible solution incorporated in the present system consists of introducing the fluorine through a short.

The inlet section would be protected from corrosion by a layer of frozen salt as in the fluorinator. Heat is supplied to this section in the present case as a result of turbulence in the molten salt caused by bubbles; in an actual case, heat would be generated in the salt as a result of fission product decay. This method of gas introduction appears to be feasible, although it will not produce small-diameter gas bubbles.

Liquid-vapor equilibrium data necessary for the evaluation and development of the possible distillation step in the processing of two-fluid MSBR fuel salt, LiF-BeF2 (66-34 mole %), are being determined by the transpiration method. In the absence of any information regarding complex molecules in the vapor phase, the partial pressures of LiF, BeF2, and solute fluorides were calculated on the assumption that only monomers existed in the vapor. In each experiment, the apparent partial pressures P could be described adequately by linear expressions.

Data for three LiF-BeF2 solutions are given in Table 25. 1. The composition LiF-BeF2 (90-10 mole %) is approximately the one expected in the still pot during vacuum distillation and gives LiFBeF2 (66-34 mole %) as the condensate. The relative volatilities of BeF2 with respect to LiF obtained in experiments with LiF-BeF2 binary systems are in reasonable agreement with those reported by Cantor, who also used the transpiration method. 71 obtained by Hightower and McNeese, who used an equilibrium still method and is higher than the values obtained when the salt contained small amounts of RbF, CsF, ZF, or UF (Table 25. 1). This scatter in values is not surprising when one considers that small variations in the composition of the liquid and/or vapor lead to large changes in the relative volatility. For example, Hightower and McNeese reported that the vapor in equilibrium with LiF-BeF2 mole %.

Complexation observed mass spectrometrically in the vapors above LiF-BeF₂ solutions would make the total pressure even lower than that predicted by our transpiration experiments. Our results are also in disagreement with those of Cantor at several other LiF-BeF₂ compositions. The reason for this disparity is not obvious.

Respectively, gave relative volatilities of UF, with respect to LiF (Table 25. 1); which confirmed the earlier assumption that adequate uranium recovery cannot be achieved in the distillation step. Hence, as previously assumed, these two fission products will probably set the discard rate.

A 12-liter still pot, a condenser, and a 48-liter condensate receiver. The equipment has been installed and checked out in a test facility to perform non-radioactive experiments prior to operation with irradiated MSRE fuel carrier salt. Two experiments have been made to date. During non-radioactive operation, four 48-liter batches at about 1 mm Hg. The thermal insulation and heaters will then be removed from the still, and a thorough examination of the equipment will be made. After examination, the still will be moved to a cell at the MSRE site for distillation of a 48-liter batch of fluorinated fuel salt.

The first distillation run was completed in 83 hours using approximately 48 liters of MSRE fuel carrier salt. At the beginning of the month, 9. 4 liters of salt was transferred to the still pot, and the condenser pressure was lowered to 2. 0 mm Hg. Startup of the equipment was hampered by unsatisfactory operation of the liquid level probes in the still pot. The system was held at 900°C and 2 mm Hg for approximately 4 hours, after which time the probes performed adequately. The system was then operated with a still pot temperature of 900 to 950°C and a condenser pressure of 0. 65 to 2.

Referred to the still pot periodically in order to maintain a volume of about 9 liters. This operating period reduced the concentration of BeF₂ in the still pot from the initial concentration of 30 mole%. The still pot temperature was raised to 990°C, and distillation rates were measured during a 40-hr period at condenser pressures of 0. 5, 0. 3, and 0. 055 mm Hg. Results at these conditions are summarized in Table 26. 1. During the last 40 hr of operation, the still liquid level and salt feed rate were controlled automatically. Equipment operation was smooth. Four condensate samples were taken and have been submitted for analysis. At the end of the run, approximately 8 liters of the initial salt mixture was used to flush the high-melting salt from the still pot in order to produce salt having a liquidus of less than 700°C.

And a condenser pressure of 2 mm Hg were held for 1.07 mm Hg. These conditions were maintained for about 30 hours. The distillation rate during this period is given in Table 26.1. Still pot liquid level and salt feed rate were controlled automatically during the entire run. Minor difficulty was experienced in taking condensate samples when small amounts of salt vapor condensed.

Ionization and condensation surfaces equal the difference between the vapor pressure of salt in the still pot and the pressure at the lower end of the condenser. For this reason, the distillation rate should be essentially independent of condenser pressure for condenser pressures much lower than the salt vapor pressure. A 21% increase in the distillation rate was observed as the still pot temperature was increased from 990 to 1005°C. The corresponding increase in salt vapor.

Flux, so as to avoid parasitic capture by the prot- proves more difficult than expected. In both flow, actinium before it decays to U-233. One concept, sheets, fertile salt from the reactor (stream 1) is conceptual MSBR design is based on a two-fluid contacted with liquid bismuth (stream 3) containing concept, with the fertile stream circulating in thorium (0. 003 mole fraction). The bismuth separate channels through the high-flux core contains a lithium concentration such that no region as well as through the blanket surrounding thorium or lithium transfers between the metal and the core. The protactinium concentration in the fertile salt.

Capture promising protactinium removal processes and recycle to the extractor after proper reductive extraction using liquid bismuth. Amounts of thorium and lithium reductant have been analyzed to evaluate their feasibility, added by electrolytically reducing all or part of a recycle salt stream from the decay tank (stream 7).

The salt mixture formed by oxidation of stream 4 would have an undesirably high liquidus. The liquidus is lowered in the preferred flowsheet by recycling salt from the decay tank through the reducer and into the oxidizer. This transfers most of the protactinium to the metal stream, which then flows to the oxidizer where the protactinium is oxidized and returns to the decay tank without passing through the main extractor.

In the modification shown in 0. 2, fresh 7Li and thorium metal are added to bismuth to form stream 3; no reducer is used. The metal stream from the first extractor is contacted with a recycle from the decay tank, as in 0. 1, before entering the oxidizer, but the recycle salt is sent to waste. Lithium fluoride is added to the oxidizer to reduce the liquidus of the resulting salt, and since this material will not return to the reactor blanket, natural lithium can be used. Another alkali metal fluoride (e. g. , sodium fluoride) could be used if it does not interfere with protactinium transfer in the second extractor.

To evaluate the relative merits of these flow sheets, flow rates, and compositions of all streams were calculated over a wide range of conditions. The lithium and thorium concentrations in the blanket were fixed at 0. 72 and 0. 28 mole fraction, respectively, and the protactinium generation calculations were based on a processing rate of 5. 81 x 10^6 g-moles/day of blanket salt, which is 4750 ft/day (25 gpm), approximately two blankets.

Figure 27. 3 shows the required metal flow rate (in gallons per minute) as a function of the number of stages in the extractor for three protactinium concentrations in the blanket (5 x 10^-3, 10 x 10^-3, and 20 x 10^-3 mole fraction). These blanket concentrations may be compared with the value of approximately 80 x 10^-3 mole fraction, which resulted in the blanket of a no-Pa-removal reactor system that has been considered.

Raising the protactinium concentration in the blanket raises the equilibrium (or maximum) metal loading and lowers the required bismuth rate. Increasing the number of stages in the contactor also improves the performance of the extractor and lowers the required metal rate. However, research shows that the gain will be relatively small for more than two or three stages. Required metal flow rates will be about 0.3 x 10^3 g-moles/day (0. 1).

In the reference flowsheet, the salt recycle rate to the oxidizer is determined by the desired liquidus temperature. Figure 27. With an infinite.

Recycle rate: the lithium composition only approaches the blanket composition so that it is necessary to operate with a slightly lower lithium composition in the decay salt than in the blanket. The no-reducer flowsheet has the option of a lower reductant composition, which increases the lithium-to-thorium ratio in the metal. This allows a lower salt recycle but requires higher metal.

The volume of the decay tank is determined by the concentration of protactinium desired in the tank but is subject to limitations. The tank must contain enough protactinium so that 10.6 g-moles decay in the tank per day (ignoring decay outside the tank). In the given conditions, the tank volume will be constrained by heat removal considerations rather than by the maximum achievable concentration. Heat generated in the decay tank from protactinium decay will amount to 6.7 MW, indicating a minimum tank volume of a few hundred cubic feet.

The reference flowsheet shown in Fig. 1 is the preferred flowsheet, and further studies and development work for two-region processing should be aimed at this system. This flowsheet provides a minimum-size reducer and bismuth rate while placing little restriction on the decay tank volume; the decay tank volume is governed largely by heat removal considerations.

Two tests have been made, one at 450°C and one at 500°C, each with 340 g of LiF-BeF2-ZrF4-UF4 (63-32-5-0. 8 mole%). Salt samples were taken during the runs at intervals (after He sparging) determined by the necessity of changing a 12-g NaF trap used for recovery of the UF. In each test, 50% F2—50% He (146 ml/min) was used initially, followed by pure fluorine (146 ml/min) at the end of the run to ensure complete uranium recovery. In another test at 500°C, pure fluorine was used throughout. A trap containing 2 M KOH was employed to sorb unused fluorine and volatile chromium and molybdenum compounds that passed through the NaF trap.

As shown in Table 28.1, the UF, volatilization rate, and the degree of fluorine utilization were higher at 500°C than at 450°C. The amount of chromium leached from the Hastelloy N reactor increased with temperature. The effect of temperature on the solubilization of iron and nickel from the reactor is not as clear (the dip tube, thermocouple well, and reactor bottom were made of Ni-200).

Various estimates of the corrosion rate can be calculated from the chromium data using different time periods (Table 28. 2). The estimates for the complete runs are somewhat arbitrary because fluorination was continued after the uranium had been removed to observe chromium behavior.

After most of the uranium had been removed from the salt (Table 28.1), this chromium compound was effectively trapped by NaF at 25°C, forming an orange complex compound. Molybdenum (probably as MoF6) volatilized to a large extent throughout each run and, as expected from the dissociation pressure of MoF6, was not completely recovered in the 25°C NaF trap. Most of it passed through to the KOH scrub solution.

The fluorine utilization efficiency figures (calculated from UF output and fluorine input) suggest that the utilization was highest during the first 2 hours of fluorination. This is not strictly true since the method of calculation does not take into account the fluorine consumed in changing the average oxidation number of the uranium. Also, the data do not imply a definite consumption.

In the currently proposed analytical procedure for the determination of uranium in MSRE salt, which involves fluorination as the first step, a precision of ±0.1% is needed. Since it is anticipated that the use of remotely controlled hot cell coulometric instrumentation will introduce an inherent error of ±1%, decontamination of the UF₄-NaF complex product from the fluorination step to a level appropriate for analysis in a low-level radiation area will be essential.

5 uranium losses in the waste salt and fluorination. Fe Results of preliminary tests in which uranium has been fluorinated from MSRE-type salt containing using specially prepared MSRE-type salt samples. The samples consisted of copper capsules, each containing about 46 g of LiF-BeF2-ZrF4-UF4 with about 0.1 mc of 103Ru, 105Nb, 134I, or 130Te. Solutions of these tracers were first evaporated to dryness with the corresponding carrier (about). In recent fluorination tests, some volatilization of UF4 occurred when the uranium oxidation number in the salt was as low as 4.3. This was calculated on the basis of complete consumption of fluorine introduced in the first 1. 5 min of fluorine flow. The mixture of 25% F2-75% N2 was passed through the melt for 30 min followed by pure fluorine for an additional 30 min at 100 ml/min (STP). The product gas stream (containing F2, UF6, and volatile fission product activity) was passed through a 20-g NaF trap at 400°C to remove the fission products and then into a 10-g NaF trap at 25°C, where the UF6 product was sorbed. An additional 5-g NaF trap was inserted downstream for determination of any.

Decontamination factors obtained for Ru, Nb, and Te during the fluorination step have been greater than 100, and thus these nuclides apparently do not make a significant contribution to the overall activity level of the UF6 product. The relative amounts volatilized from the salt.

During fluorination, the yields were, respectively, about 10^-4, 10, and greater than 99%, with corresponding material balances of about 95, 10, and 0. 1%. Essentially, all the ruthenium and niobium that was volatilized was trapped on the 400°C NaF trap; however, no appreciable sorption of tellurium was detected. Attempts to achieve an adequate decontamination factor (greater than 10%) for 111 have been unsuccessful so far. In this test, the measurement of the temperature of the sorption bed may have been highly in error; therefore, a duplicate test will be made.

The modifications to the MSRE fuel processing facility to permit processing with a 30-day decay time have been completed. In November, it was decided to remove the structural-metal fluorides formed during fluorination from the salt before returning it to the reactor system. Design of a salt filter for removing the metals after reduction has been completed, and fabrication is in progress. The filter will have 9 ft of Inconel porous metal as a filter medium. The filter element is designed for remote replacement in case of plugging or rupture. The filter has a capacity of about 40 lb of corrosion products, the amount formed during 50 hr of fluorination with a corrosion rate of 0.2 mil/hr.

Handling of the sodium fluoride absorbers loaded with UF6 will be simplified considerably since it has been learned that most of the noble-metal fission products leave the salt during reactor operation. Molybdenum-99 would have been the principal radiation source with short-decayed fuel. The problem of overheating of the high-temperature sodium fluoride trap from TaNb is also eliminated. A third problem that has been eliminated is the discharge of tellurium during processing.

The MSRE personnel completed a detailed evaluation of their fuel requirements and loading operations for the 35U program. The predicted operational fuel load for the reactor is 35.9 kg of uranium (91.4% 33y), and the contingency is 3.6 kg, giving a total of 39.5 kg of 735 to be delivered to the MSRE as the eutectic salt. This is a decrease of about 3 kg from earlier planning. At the same time, the number of enriching capsules was reduced from 60 to 45, so the surplus capsules were removed from the existing array.

The unshielded glove box used at the MSRE for drilling the uranium-enriching capsule vent and drain holes, and for weighing the capsules before loading into the sampler-enricher, is inadequate for the highly active 7U. These operations will now be done in the TURF before the capsules are shipped to the MSRE.

Operated drilling, weighing, and packaging box has been built and tested for this operation. The lifting cables and keys will be attached to the capsules before they are filled with salt; thus, avoiding a remote welding operation.

The method used for bulk additions of 735U fuel salt from the 4-in. storage containers to the reactor via a heated transfer line was discarded in favor of a simpler method for the highly active 233y salt. The bulk additions will be made from 2h-in. -diam salt cans that are vented and have an opening in the bottom. They are essentially giant enrichment capsules that are lowered into the heated dump tank so that the salt melts and drains into the tank. Four 7.0-kg uranium cans, one 3.0-kg uranium can, one 2.0-kg uranium can, and two 0.5-kg uranium cans will be delivered to the MSRE. The cans are assembled in two clusters for filling with salt. One cluster consists of the four 7.0-kg cans, and the other is the remaining five small cans plus one extra 2.0-kg can which is arranged to hold recoverable salt heels from the salt processing system. The capsule filling furnace in cell G was replaced with a larger furnace that will accommodate both the capsules and 2%-in. -diam salt can clusters.

We have determined that the density of the stored 5YO is higher than the original estimate. This, plus the decrease in the total amount of uranium required as noted above, will allow us to make three batches of approximately 13. 5 kg U each instead of the four batches planned earlier. A significant saving in operating time will result from the elimination of one of the production batches. The 45 enriching capsules will be filled from the first batch of salt. The remainder of the first batch, the second batch, and part of the third batch will be used to fill the cluster of four 7.0-kg uranium salt cans.

The 744UO oxide can opener and dumping box were designed using can drawings and sample cans from Savannah River. The cans in storage in the pilot plant were not checked closely because of the high radiation levels of the oxide. After the box was completed, it was found that the cans were 1.75 in. shorter than shown by the drawings and can samples. Since modification of the charging box to accommodate the shorter cans was impractical, we will cement a 1.5-in. extension on each can. The fixtures for tapering the can end and removing the weld bead, for pressing the extension on the cans, and for curing the cemented joint have been built and tested. The fabrication costs and operating problems caused by this development are minor.

The TURF building was turned over to ORNL on September 15, 1967, and the CPFF contractor started preparing cell G for installation of the process equipment and completed this by mid-October. The CPFF work consisted of installing the instrument panel, the gas supply and electrical systems to terminals inside the cell, the cell platform, the shielding plugs for unused pipe slots and windows, the PAR manipulator, and the can charging chute.

The processing equipment installed on and in equipment for adding the extensions to the oxide cans, for dismantling the capsule and can assemblies, and for drilling and weighing the capsules will be located in the northwest and northeast corners of the cell. About 130 formal drawings plus 150 field sketches have been issued to date for the job. We estimate that the design work is more than 98% complete as of February 29, 1968. Pressure vessel, criticality, building, and radiochemical plant safety reviews were completed, and the process and buildings were approved for MSRE 75% fuel production.

Equipment checkout, minor alterations, and changes were completed, and the cold test run with 5UO (11.6 kg 7°U) was started on January 15, 1968. Some problems were encountered with the can opener and dumping box. After a few cans were opened, a groove-rolling device accidentally jammed the can chuck, stripping the motor drive gears. The gears were replaced, and the remaining cans were opened and dumped, though with difficulty due to binding of the cans in the box. The box was removed from the cell, decontaminated, and sent to the shop for repairs and for alterations to improve operability. The chemical part of the mn started on January 24, 1968, with the 900°C sintering treatment followed by hydrogen reduction of the UO2 to UO2. The offgas filter plugged during the reduction step but was opened by blowback and has not been a problem since the reduction step. Treatment with H2-HF has been underway since January 27. It was planned to follow the progress of the conversion of UO2 to UF6 by titrating the off-gas to determine HF utilization and to periodically determine the freezing point of the charge as it approached the eutectic point. The off-gas titration was hampered by HF-water condensation in the plastic lines to the caustic scrubber bottle and by problems with remote manipulator operation of the conventional burets in the cell.

This rig has since been replaced by a reliable titration system, but in the early stages of the conversion, it was impossible to get reliable results with the existing titration system. Attempts to run freezing point curves on the salt in the reaction vessel were unsuccessful because of the high thermal capacity of the reaction vessel and furnace as compared with the salt charge.

Melts taken after about 290 hours of HF-H treatment showed that only 5 to 10% conversion of UO2 to UF4 had occurred. The H2-HF sparger tube was removed from the reaction vessel on February 14 and was found to be corroded off at the liquid-gas interface. After about 200 hours of additional operation, about 71% of the UO2 had been reacted. The HF utilization, as determined by titration with the new apparatus, has decreased in the expected manner since then. Progress of the reaction is being followed mainly by sampling the salt.

Salt sampler probe and the sampler box. The box was returned to the shop for repairs and for alterations to improve operability. At the end of the month, the HF treatment was still underway, and 90 to 95% of the UO2 had been converted to UF. The progress of the reaction has been slow owing to poor contacting of gas and salt in the 8-in. -diam pot as compared with the 4-in. -diam pots used during flowsheet development, and interruptions of the process due to equipment problems and for salt sampling operations. We now estimate that the chemical part of each 3°U run will take about 28 days instead of the 17 estimated earlier. Tentative plans are to complete the cold run in March and prepare the three batches of.

It was assumed that the MSR had been operating sufficiently long for fission products and 233Pa to be present in equilibrium concentrations. For 233Da, the characteristic equilibrium was for a 3-day processing cycle. For fission products, equilibrium was established for three different situations: (1) all fission products removed on a 38-day cycle through the processing plant; (2) noble gases removed on a 50-sec cycle by sparging with an inert gas in the circulating loop; and (3) in addition to noble-gas sparging, noble metals removed on a 50-hr cycle by reaction with piping, heat exchanger, and reactor surfaces. The vertical separation of the three appropriately labeled curves of. 1 is a measure of the difference in decay heat from these three assumed conditions. The largest difference for times soon after shutdown occurs at about 1 hr when the noble-gas- and noble-metal-free fuel produces.

This reactor has a breeding ratio of 1.076, and there is 205 kg of Pa in the fuel and processing plant. The Pa concentration in the fuel is 7.25 g/ft (14.5 kg total), which at equilibrium generates 0.367 kW of heat per cubic foot. There is 195. 5 kg in the processing plant, producing.
