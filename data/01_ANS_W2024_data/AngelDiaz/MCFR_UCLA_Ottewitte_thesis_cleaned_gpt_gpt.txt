In response to this concern, President Ford announced that the US would no longer consider reprocessing of LR fuel to be a foregone conclusion. The alternative, of course, is to stockpile or to bury spent fuels, thereby creating a problem of actinide waste management. That would appear to be less than an optimum ecological alternative as much.

2385 would never be used for mining trans of the uranium mined (mostly from mountains containing 10,000 parts of embedded uranium) from natural to machine-processed state for the recovery of 72 parts fuel. Of that, reactors consume 7 to 10 parts; a few parts change into plutonium, and the rest currently becomes other actinide waste.

Technical Solution: Thorium Fuel Cycle The thorium fuel cycle solves some of these problems. By starting with a material which is lower in atomic weight, this fuel cycle eventually produces far less alpha-active waste (especially carcinogenic and weapons-grade Pu) than the 238U.

Advantages of fluid-fuel reactors include the continuous addition of fuel and removal of fission products, eliminating the need for fuel refabrication. Molten-salt reactors (MSR) have undergone more extensive development compared to other fluid-fuel power systems. They seem to offer advantages in restricting the proliferation of nuclear explosives: the fuel cycle inventory of weapons-grade material outside the reactor is minimal and concentrated at the power plants, reducing the need for stockpiling or shipping of weapons-grade fissile materials. The introduction of the MSFR began shortly after World War II and extended into the 70s, with several laboratories exploring molten-salt fast reactor (MSFR) concepts. Interest in this area has generally mirrored the progress of the thermal MSR and has diminished in recent years. Throughout this period, the absence of cladding in an MSR has suggested a neutron economy adequate for breeding.

Captures in fission products, core structural materials, and control poisons. An MSFR is not so sensitive; it has no moderator and little internal structure. Cl and limited alkali (typically Na) are the lightest materials present. Therefore, the neutron spectrum remains fast, and fission products absorb far fewer neutrons.

U and the 238 jpg cycles differ in their neutron economics. As a result, interest in the thermal molten salt breeder reactor (TMSBR) has centered on its special usefulness for breeding on the U-233 cycle. Interest in the MSFR has focused on exceptional breeding gain (BG) with the 238 yoy cycle, [MSFR(U/Pu)]: up to.

Though not usually emphasized, the very hard spectrum and good neutron economy of an MSFR offer the prospect of usefully consuming all actinide products. Sooner or later, all the transactinides fission. If some capture initially, that only (generally) further deforms the nucleus, thereby increasing the probability of fission. Thus, the MSFR offers strong potential for resolving current concerns, particularly.

MSR technology first appeared in the open literature in 1957. Hale reported on the Aircraft Reactor Experiment: a beryllium-moderated, thermal reactor fueled with a UF6/NaF/ark mix and contained in Inconel. This reactor successfully operated in 1954 for more than 90,000 kWh without incident, at thermal powers up to 2. 5 MW and temperatures as high as 1650°F.

This effort led to the design, construction, and operation of the fifth Molten Salt Reactor Experiment (MSR2). Critical operation hours of operation were demonstrated at remarkably high levels. In recent years, Battelle Northwest Laboratory (BNWL) has conducted critical experiments on MSBR configurations.

ANL identified the need for in-pile corrosion testing at high burnups to clarify the effect of noble-metal deposition on container metal. Presently, all work has stopped. A current problem was that of carbides into the grain boundaries keeps He from forming and swelling there, but at high temperatures, the carbides disappear into the grains. E. Zesroski of EPRI feels that the problem with the MSBR was whether the system parts would hold together very long. In 20122, Development of the NCFR, Goodman et al proposed a molten-chloride fast reactor (CFR) in 1952. Scatchard et al reviewed the chemical problems involved. In 1955, Bulmer et al designed and evaluated a 2,500 Mth NCFR, externally cooled. At that time, the work was secret and only later declassified. Chlorides of sodium, magnesium, uranium, and plutonium made up the fuel salt. The blanket was depleted uranium oxide, cooled by sodium. Their report contains numerous trade studies, some still. Bulmer chose chlorides over fluorides to limit neutron moderation. However, he felt that the strong 35¢3(a4p) reaction would require enrichment in 3To1. M. Taube of the Institute of Nuclear Research, Warsaw, shared this view. More recently, both Taube and Faugeras have mentioned that fluoride salts may work well with 2334 in a fast reactor despite the extra moderation. The MSFR work then shifted to Argonne National Laboratory.

In-core vs. out-of-core cooling: In-core offers lower inventory (SI) but high structural radiation damage. The extra shielding for out-of-core is inconsequential. Though the out-of-core (Pu) version offers a breeding gain of 0. 6-0. 7 to counteract the extra inventory, the economic measure of interest (at least for U/Pu cycles) is approximately St. Above in summary, out-of-core will be easiest but may be less economic in terms of fuel costs.

Of fission product waste. The burner features a thermal flux trap surrounded by a fast reactor molten fuel. The higher the specific power (1M/1) in the system, the lower the steady-state fission product concentration becomes.

Presently, the Swiss work has stopped as the electorate pushes the laboratory from reactor research towards general energy research and development. Electricite de France (EdF) sponsored the development of the MSBR as a backup to the Superphoenix breeder. EdF emphasized lower powers for near-term feasibility. Their long-term interests included direct-contact in-core molten-lead cooling. CEA pursued higher temperatures for long-term application.

The American and French atomic organizations were also seeking to agree on the fields of preparation for a 200-mile MSBR demo plant. They were to decide in 1979 on the construction of this reactor, depending on the progress with high-temperature reactors and the success of the French Superphoenix 1200 MW(e) Liquid Metal Breeder Reactor (LMFBR).

The MSFR interested them the most, and they felt that such a study would complement the US MSBR program. A preliminary study of a fast system using the 233U cycle and fluoride salts did not look encouraging, so they refocused on a 23U Supa cycle and chloride program extended to include other materials aspects.

The direct scheme encountered too many problems. The in-ccre cooling concept appeared to warrant further study, but the fuel inventory did not appear to be as low as first thought. Also, the high velocities and high pumping pressures presented serious design problems. The corrosion limits and strength of molybdenum or its alloys at reactor temperatures represented a large unknown.

With out-of-core cooling, at first, the fuel inventory in the reactor circuit was too high. However, compact layouts and higher (but still achievable) heat exchanger volumetric ratings reduced neutron flux to 3 x 10^8 in the reactor and 3 x 10^3 at the end.

A much larger supporting research program exists in the USSR than in the Western world. A USSR review book on liquid-salt Nuclear Reactors regards MSRs as reactors of the future with compact and promising fuel cycles. They conclude that the developmental focus must be on the external fuel cycle. Therefore, the USSR's attention to salt.

More specifically, how will the candidate container materials - Mo alloys, graphite, or composites with these - hold up at high temperatures to corrosion by the variety of mutants and oxidation states which high burnup produces? The answer to such questions will come from in-pile corrosion testing. The French have an ongoing experimental program in such engineering studies, but it may be proprietary.

One primary facet of the nuclear waste problem is that reactor operation induces short- and intermediate-lived radioactivity in materials which had been stable or only long-lived radioactive. The solution is to alternatively store the activated materials until they decay or to transmute them back into harmless stable or quasi-stable nuclides. When operation produces nuclides which poison the environment and last long, then ecology prefers the added speed of trans.

Fission products and transmuted actinides emit most of the radiation in spent fuel. Some of these radioisotopes exist for long times, comparable to a human lifespan. Those with a half-life of a few to 50 years are particularly hazardous because they radiate faster than the longer-lived ones. How long each element remains in a human or animal depends on its biological elimination half-life, which may be very long.

Hazardous materials have half-lives long enough to warrant processing; the rest just require short-term holdup before release to the atmosphere. Low-hazard tritium relatively emits only weak radiation; its maximum allowable concentration is among the highest for any radioactive material. Furthermore, the body excretes it rapidly.

The actinides have sparked controversy in recent years. Their long half-life makes actinides a quasi-permanent burden unless one can transmute or otherwise remove them from the environment. Alpha-emitters pose the most significant threat, particularly when ingested. Plutonium is the worst of these: inside the body, it seeks out and locates on bones, which makes it.

Elements react chemically with biological systems; some of them detrimentally. Others may be safe in elemental form but not as compounds. Individual isotopes can also harm living matter by emitting dangerous radiation. All the isotopes of actinide elements radiate. Plutonium predominates among these elements because it comprises five quasi-stable isotopes and constitutes the first significant element above starter uranium on the A scale.

The main isotopes of plutonium, in order of decreasing importance, are 239Pu, 240Pu, 241Pu, and 238Pu. This reflects their usual concentrations and activity rates. In high-burnup LMFBR fuel, Pu-241 presents the principal short-term hazard (Table 3. 6 cm in air and less than 45 µm in water). In each ionizing collision with air or water molecules, the alpha loses 35 eV. After about 120,000 collisions, it has lost all of its kinetic energy. It then stops, captures two electrons, and changes into a neutral helium atom.

The most dangerous situation arises when plutonium enters the human body. Alpha particles can then penetrate into the tissues to a depth of 45 µm. Tissues generally are shielded by membranes, but these are thinner than the outer layer of skin.

As water comprises more than 70% of the weight of human tissue, the ionizing penetration produces hydrogen peroxide through radiolysis. Peroxide acts as a very strong poison inside living tissue: "through a series of chemical reactions, it changes the structure in the enzymes which catalyze biochemistry inside the living cell. " Prolonged irradiation by alpha particles also deforms nucleic acids.

One can either store long-lived spent fuel wastes or transform them into non-hazardous products: those that are stable or near stable, or that decay shortly into the same (Figure 2. 1-3). Studies to date would transmute waste in Controlled Thermonuclear Reactors, the Savannah River Plant high-flux production reactors, power reactors, accelerators, and others. Taube and others have shown that of the trouble.

Some radiation emitters have low cross sections (<1 barn) for thermal neutron capture transmutation into O and Be. However, a thermal flux trap in a fast molten salt reactor could provide a sufficiently high flux to reduce the effective half-lives from 29 and 30. 1 years down to 2 and 9 years, respectively. A solid fuel reactor could not do this because of technical limits on specific power.

Actinide wastes accumulate when nuclides resist fission. Figure 2. 1-4 indicates the prominent actinides of the Th and U fuel cycles and their fission tendencies. More explicitly, Figure 2. 1-5 shows that fission generally does not predominate over capture until rather high neutron energies are reached.

According to their median flux energies (Table 2. I-II), fast reactors must have many more neutrons above the Figure 2. 1-5 crossover points than thermal reactors. MSFRs, which minimize neutron moderation (elastic scattering), will have the hardest neutron spectrum of all power reactors. Reactors with highly-enriched fuels (Table 2. I-II) will also exhibit a faster spectrum.

Development of US Policy In the United States, the development of policy is a complex and dynamic process that involves multiple stakeholders and branches of government. The formulation of policies is influenced by a variety of factors, including political considerations, public opinion, economic conditions, and international relations. The process typically begins with the identification of a problem or issue that requires government intervention. This is followed by research and analysis to evaluate potential solutions and their implications. Once a policy proposal is developed, it undergoes a series of reviews and revisions before being presented to decision-makers for approval. Throughout this process, policymakers must consider the interests and perspectives of various stakeholders, including government agencies, advocacy groups, industry representatives, and the general public. Ultimately, the goal of US policy development is to address societal challenges and promote the common good.

US nuclear energy policy was, from the first, based on a keen awareness of the dangerous aspect of nuclear electric power. The Acheson-Lilienthal Report of 1946 saw a close association between the civilian and military aspects of nuclear energy; it recommended international ownership of nuclear explosive materials.

There is where the damage was done. In 1957, the International Atomic Energy Agency (IAEA) was established primarily to monitor the flow of commercial nuclear materials and equipment among member countries. The charter advocates control over excess quantities of plutonium but does not restrict them. The nuclear policymakers of the fifties and the sixties.

Enormously difficult to design and fabricate, the U. S. near-monopoly on the technology, fuels, and equipment for civilian nuclear power activities worldwide seemed to ensure U. S. control of the situation. Fledgling nuclear power programs seemed to be unrelated to the development of nuclear weapons. The earlier prescience of the Acheson-Lilienthal group that they had everything to do with it was ignored.

It was once widely thought, for example, that you could not make nuclear weapons with plutonium derived from spent power reactor fuel. The Acheson-Lilienthal report seems to have misled many, including the IAEA, into believing you could denature plutonium. As a result, many of those responsible for protection against military diversion of plutonium were relying upon technological barriers that did not.

On October 28, 1976, President Ford concluded that avoidance of proliferation must come before economic interests. Therefore, we should defer reprocessing until there is sound reason to conclude that the world community can effectively overcome the associated risks of proliferation.

Two factors contributed to Ford's decision and to the subsequent development of President Carter's non-proliferation policy. The first is how the safeguards deficiency impacts international security: we cannot control the plutonium or highly-enriched uranium of other nations should they suddenly decide to abrogate agreements and appropriate explosive material for weapons. At the same time.

The second factor affecting current policies is the dubious economics of reprocessing and recycling of plutonium in light water reactors. This makes the early introduction of plutonium into international trade as unnecessary as it is dangerous.

Presidents Ford and Carter both advocated that we restrict access to dangerous materials, pause in the commitment to plutonium separation and use, and end the search for alternatives to national stockpiling. Their efforts to persuade our allies and trading partners met, at best, with mixed success. It is hardly surprising that this US policy shift on plutonium produced widespread irritation, alarm, and even the cynical suggestion that the Americans were less interested in proliferation than in perpetuating a commercial advantage.

Both Britain and France have emphasized the security advantages of their reprocessing plans. The British suggest that if reprocessing does not relieve the accumulation of spent fuel, non-nuclear-weapon states will have to develop indigenous reprocessing facilities. This will certainly pose a serious danger of proliferation. Britain argues that the best way to discourage this development is to confine reprocessing services to the states which already have the bomb.

Carter subsequently submitted a bill, the Nuclear Non-Proliferation Act of 1977. It would impose stricter rules on U.S. nuclear exports, which would block their use for explosives. Opposition to this act argued that whatever relationship exists cannot be reversed and that it is so remote that further controls aren't necessary.

Proliferation as prevention of weapons capability in a non-weapons state. The goal of an alternate fuel cycle would be to deter or reveal diversion, such that suitable time would be provided, which allowed other countries to negotiate or induce that country to stop.

The WSs generally produce plutonium for weapons purposes in large special-purpose reactors and separate it from the irradiated fuel in government reprocessing plants. However, nuclear power generation electricity also produces plutonium. Also, the same technology (and in some cases the same plants) which enrich uranium for fuel can also enrich it further for.

The scale of the world's military nuclear programs is vast. In fact, in most countries, the quantities of plutonium in spent reactor fuel, if separated out and stored, will dwarf any plausible military needs. Japan plans to send 3 Gg (metric kilotons) of spent fuel to Windscale. La Hague reportedly will process about 6 Gg of spent fuel for Japan, the Federal Republic of Germany, Sweden, Switzerland, Belgium, Holland, and Austria. This means separating about 75 Ng (metric tons) of plutonium, or enough for about 10,000 nuclear weapons. Clearly, heavy financial investments ride on the outcome: when transport charges are included, the European contracts represent almost three billion dollars in business. The intense international competition.

Pride tends to obscure the proliferation threat, supports the relatively safe fuel cycle activities, and discourages common rules for international nuclear trade. But before formulating rules, much less implementing them, one must ascertain just what is dangerous and just how much the spread of nuclear weapons threatens individual countries and world security. Clearly, a common understanding does not yet exist, as witnessed by U.S. opposition to European export sales of plutonium reprocessing and uranium enrichment facilities.

Recent U. S. Administrations have shunned reprocessing. Many analysts believe this directly increases the risks of both diversion and proliferation. With no reprocessing, the increasing amount of long-cooled spent fuel, and the increasing number of locations with such fuel, increase diversion risks. The likelihood of proliferation increases because concern for a reliable supply stimulates the development of independent enrichment capabilities.

The capability to develop fissile production now exists in fifty countries, with 10-20 additional possibly in the next decade. A secure fuel supply and reprocessing service through international commerce would economically discourage these countries from developing their own. The economic inhibition is substantial since initial small-scale operations are highly uneconomic relative to natural manufacturing and production capabilities in supplier countries.

Second, attitudes on the return of Pu. Of prime importance to proliferation is the question: who gets the bred Pu—the reprocessor or the spent fuel owner? If plutonium eventually displaces uranium as the primary fuel for power reactors, how can indigenous reprocessing be successfully discouraged outside the nuclear weapon states or a big supplier's club? The goal, long sought by many.

Presently, non-Zuratom countries need US permission both to transfer US-supplied spent fuel to other re-processors like Windscale and La Hague and to get Pu back. Pu can return only under the time-diverted material could be transformed into weapons. England has pledged the material will be returned to its owners only in a form that will reduce the risks of proliferation. In his report on the Windscale inquiry, British Judge Parker took refuge in time: this matter can be alleviated to some extent.

All reactors either produce Pu or 2334, or start with fully-enriched 23 4y. Thus, weapons-grade fuel is intrinsically recoverable from all reactor fuel cycles. However, which fuel attracts nationalist and subnational groups the least as a weapon? The answer may depend on unraveling complex interrelated factors.

Means isotopic content enrichment in U exceeding 12% or 20%, respectively. In the broad sense, weapons-grade means any material that can undergo chemical separation to yield Pu or the uranium enrichments mentioned above. Thus, dilution with any other element, including thorium, does not lower the weapons grade as chemistry can separate out the U again.

Can be left in a highly radioactive state (by means of fission products). The associated biological hazard would then discourage its use by subnational weapon makers. Special national laboratories could readily clean these up, but the ever-present 232 impurity in 2335 will continue to decay into hazardous emitters.

Preignition. The explosive yield of a fission bomb depends on how long the imploded configuration stays together. Multiplied source neutrons from spontaneous 2405 fissions cause early energy release, which produces a premature disassembly. This greatly reduces the total energy yield of the device. Consequently, a military might shun high burnup plutonium (high in 74py), but a subnational group might still desire it. In pure actinide metal, only spontaneous fission can contribute copious source neutrons. However, actinide compounds produce intrinsic preignition triggers through (α, n) reactions. Table 2. 2 compares the typical activities from these neutron sources. No Th/cycle isotope can match the 2405py spontaneous fission rate. 232 comes closest in half-life (Figure 2. 21).

With high Cl, F, or O concentration (as in salt or oxide compounds), the neutron rate (Table 2. 2-3) equals or exceeds the spontaneous fission neutron rate of metallic Pu (7x10^9 n/s Pu atom, 20% 2h^0n). F is much stronger than Cl or O in this regard. This should appreciably reduce the explosive threat from 233y weapons in fluoride, chloride, or oxide.

Application as a radioisotope heat source. Because its high heat generation rate will melt practical sizes of the metal, the usual form is PuC. For a large enough uncooled mass, even the oxide can melt. Oxide sources also produce neutrons through 18.

Denaturing and other technical fixes. One technical fix, the Civex process, has received a fair amount of international attention. It returns plutonium to the customer in the form of fabricated fuel containing enough radioactive products to preclude easy chemical extraction of bomb material. However, within a few years after leaving the reactor, radioactivity decay forfeits this protection. Since most spent fuel reprocessed in this century will have cooled for even longer than that, the Civex process cannot contribute to the solution of the problems we must worry about now.

Civex also must face other problems. Industry will resist irradiated fuels because of the increased occupational and public health exposures. Likewise, the owners of the material, especially foreign countries, are not likely to accept the dictates of the reprocessor on the form in which plutonium is to be returned to them. This would also argue against industrial recycling of solid material.

Fu, 2354, and 2334 are all weapons-grade. Fueling reactors with sub-weapons-grade materials does little to limit proliferation; the reactor will soon produce weapons-grade fuel from the diluent, i. e. , Pu from 2385. Also, any irradiated 2385 containing fuel constitutes a terrorist threat from TNT explosion aerosol dispersal.

The significance of stockpiles is crucial in various contexts. Stockpiles play a vital role in ensuring a stable supply of essential goods during times of scarcity or disruption. They act as a buffer against unforeseen events such as natural disasters, political unrest, or economic crises. Stockpiles help to mitigate risks associated with supply chain disruptions and ensure continuity in critical sectors like healthcare, food, and energy. Moreover, stockpiles can also influence market dynamics by impacting supply and demand equilibrium. Strategic stockpiling by governments or organizations can affect prices, availability, and market behavior. Balancing the size of stockpiles with actual demand is essential to prevent shortages or surpluses that can distort markets. In conclusion, the management and maintenance of stockpiles are significant for both stability and resilience in various sectors. Proper planning, monitoring, and utilization of stockpiles are essential to address uncertainties and challenges effectively.

Treaty forbids non-nuclear-weapon states to acquire nuclear explosive devices, whether labeled military or peaceful (they blow up the same way). Peaceful explosive services could still be provided under strict international physical control.

What about unsafeguarded production reactors? It is contended, for example, that no country choosing to build nuclear weapons would turn to its civilian power reactors for the requisite explosive materials. To divert material in this way would risk detection by the IAEA inspectors, and in addition, would provide too poor a grade of plutonium to interest weapon designers. Under this self-serving theory, if weapons material is wanted, a special-purpose unsafeguarded reactor would be built. It is possible at the moment to do this legally in countries not party to the Nonproliferation Treaty and therefore not subject to inspection of all their indigenous nuclear facilities. This underlines the need to extend the requirements of the treaty to nonsignatory nations by conditioning nuclear trade on acceptance of international agreements and inspection of all nuclear activities within importing countries.

Even if legal, however, the construction of a special purpose plutonium production reactor signals a country's intention to build bombs and, in the present climate, risks premature interception of its attempt to obtain explosive material for nuclear weapons.

The step process: appropriation from its storage place of the necessary plutonium, fabrication, and insertion into the waiting bomb. It is surely the quickest, cheapest, and least risky route to nuclear weapons. So long as individual nations are permitted to keep nuclear explosive stockpiles, they are, in effect, in possession of an option to make nuclear weapons almost literally overnight.

It is important to understand that as far as safeguards are concerned, a stock of nuclear explosive material is much more like a bomb than it is like a reactor. No one would dream of suggesting that nuclear explosive devices, regardless of how labeled, should be exported under international safeguards. Under the treaty, no such distinction is permitted. Yet, strip away the electronics and the conventional high explosives, and label the plutonium as intended for peaceful purposes, and many nuclear spokesmen, at home and abroad, will tell you that if subject to occasional inspections, it is a perfectly safe proposition: just like safeguarding power reactors.

The crux of the proliferation issue is not to completely avoid Pu. Due to advanced technology, any country can produce it without resorting to nuclear power cycles. Rather, it is to avoid having Pu lying around in large quantities where diversion is less detectable. In an MCFR (Pu), Pu is always in solution, except for that fuel which is required to start a new reactor. Reprocessing is done within.

The opportunity for national or subnational diversion of weapons-grade material will depend on the size of the fuel cycle inventory. Decentralization also implies less security.

Once through the fuel cycle, Figure 2. 2-1 diagrams the trail of weapons-grade material in a once-through fuel cycle, assuming that the initial fuel elements are low-enrichment U. After generation in the reactor, it passes through about three storage/queue depots. Possibly one more storage depot labeled permanent may appear later once it is fixed what that will be. Only one out-of-plant transfer may be necessary. The inventory in the long-term storage depots will grow with time, eventually becoming very large. Although the Pu there is not separated out, a national laboratory could easily do so.

242. 502 Solid fuel reprocessing cycle. In the solid-fuel recycle (Fig. 2. 2-2), we note that weapons-grade fuel will accumulate in three plants and maybe six storage/queue depots. Four interplant transfer operations occur, counting BG export. It is not hard to envision the equivalent of ten cores being tied up in the various queues, plants, and storage.

To reprocess or not to reprocess? The once-through fuel cycle, starting with low-enrichment U, seems to display fairly low vulnerability to subnational diversion but creates a cumulating stockpile available for national use. It also creates a long-term waste management problem and poorly uses our resources.

222. 505 To breed or not to breed. Assuming that the potential to breed excess plutonium or highly-enriched 233 exists, one must next ask: should we? The alternative is to use the excess neutrons to achieve higher fission product levels, a smaller critical mass, or some other benefit.

Breeding obviously provides initial fuel for starting up other reactors. The alternative is to start MCFRs up with Pu from spent LWR fuel or highly-enriched 235U. But either of the latter two fuels would make it easier to manufacture weapons. Also, they would cause the thorium fuel cycle in this reactor to depend on the U/Pu fuel cycle, with a system of thermal MSRs.

Only 0. 72% of U is 235y. The enrichment process loses some of that. Present reactors, without recycle, consume just 10% of the 235y before assigning the rest to semi-permanent storage. Thus, we presently waste 99. 94% of the uranium mined, an affront to the environment. If, instead, the reactor could usefully consume all of the actinide, considerably less eyesore and mining expense would result. Economics might then justify the retrieval of extensive low-grade ores. At a time of energy shortage, the present policy seems foolhardy except that it reflects the restrictions posed by economics, proliferation concern, and spent fuel waste management. These must first be overcome.

Thorium abounds three times as much as uranium in the Earth's crust and offers that much more nuclear fuel energy. The available uranium ores increase greatly if one includes not only the classical ores (>1000 ppm uranium) but the very abundant granites with 80 ppm uranium and thorium. Granite is the main constituent of the Earth's crust (up to 20 km deep). Extraction from these ores could become economical if fission reactors fully used all the Th and U present. Together with fusion reactors, such a fuel cycle.

Nature has significantly inhibited the use of Th by not providing a thorium isotope which can sustain a neutron chain reaction. Despite some unique advantages of a U-233 cycle over a U/Pu one, Th use must still prove its economics. A reactor that yields high BG in the Th cycle would help a lot.

High melting points hinder reprocessing of two solid Th fuel: ThO, melts at 3050°C, and Th metal at 1750°C. Breeding is very marginal, except with a fast reactor. Reducing non-productive neutron captures (e. g. , to fission products, core structural materials, and control poisons) becomes crucial. That suggests fluid fuel reactors: they can continuously remove fission products while adding fuel online, and some variants require no core structure.

Much attention currently centers on optimum uranium usage by candidate reactor concepts. The parameter of Megawatt days of electric energy produced per mined metric ton of uranium (aided/mined HTU) provides a suitable yardstick. Note that the numerator includes energy production from thorium, while the denominator ignores thorium consumption. Consider as a benchmark that all the uranium were somehow (ideally) consumed. The advanced concepts in Table 2. 3-I, currently under study in the US, do not come anywhere near this idealistic figure, not even when including.

One might desire that any new reactor concept be able to operate on both the Th and U cycle, so as to eventually allow the use of all our reserves. MCFR studies have already indicated large potential breeding gains on the U/Pu cycle, providing Pu is acceptable. In that event, one could also supply spent U fuel as a blanket.

Although it doesn't normally get public attention, strategic security has its place on the list of contemporary concerns due to current events: 1. The long- and short-term goals of the USSR, 2. Other political conflicts which could lead to world war, 3. The growing pains and frustration of have-nots and emerging, 4. The increasing political turmoil and unrest within America stemming from problems of cities, alienation of extremists. It might be successfully argued that fat men don't look for a fight - yon Cassius hath a lean and hungry look. Then insecurity traces to the failure to appear of cheap nuclear electricity, coupled with the disappearance of the cheap oil-fired energy source. Thus, the world still hungers for a cheap abundant energy source to solve its woes. We'd like to think the MCFR is it. Until that becomes more obvious, though, it would be well to secure our US energy supply.

At present, US energy supplies, key to our might and resourcefulness, are all aboveboard for everyone to see and aim at. This includes dams, oil tankers, and depots, fossil-fueled plants, and nuclear reactors. Actually, only the containment building of the latter protrudes above ground, but that's still.

Given sufficient explosives, a dam would seem to be a better target, both in size and certainty of wreaking financial havoc. LWR destruction would likely cause more personal injury. A fossil-fueled plant destruction would not necessarily threaten public lives, unlike bombing a city or a poisonous gas plant like chlorine.

Terrorism could rear its ugly head. Surprise attacks might often occur. In addition to the above targets, one might then add many more non-nuclear possibilities such as poisoning water systems or destroying any energy supply. For sheer havoc, though, destroying all water.

Attack. In addition, planes and missiles might be directed at nuclear plants in hopes of accomplishing what the aggressor didn't want to or couldn't send an atomic bomb to do: perhaps an atomic blast would have destroyed a valuable industrial complex, whereas an LWR core release will simply harm and demoralize a lot of.

The dominant vulnerability of the above energy sources would seem to be the presence of the potential hazard above or near the earth's surface. Moving the hazard lower mitigates the danger. Dams can't go underground. Nuclear power plants can, but it costs a lot.

This threat to energy and people probably exceeds that from a dam, which tends to be located farther from people. Also, water must follow the lay of the land, which authorities could observe and somewhat predict. Transport of fission product gases, they could not vary.

Spent fuel contains several products whose activity remains high after a year's storage. Of these, the alpha-emitters can extensively damage internals when ingested. Plutonium presents a special hazard because it locates on bones: the whole skeleton of man becomes the critical organ. Although our society has learned how to handle other toxic industrial wastes (arsenic, mercury, chlorine), control is not perfect, and accidents have occurred. Thus, we prefer to avoid plutonium production if that does not severely curtail our energy production. A reactor that usefully consumes all the actinides and has nil Pu in its system would seem very attractive.

Despite earlier misconceptions, plutonium of any grade can be put in a form suitable for the manufacture of nuclear explosive devices in a matter of days to weeks. Thus, from the moment a non-weapons state separates plutonium from spent reactor fuel and stores it, the element of timely warning, on which our present safeguards system relies, vanishes.

The same holds true, of course, for stockpiles of highly enriched 238, to avoid classification as weapons-grade. However, subsequent reactor irradiation again produces plutonium, which separates easily by chemistry. Thus, no fuel cycle can avoid producing weapons-grade fuel.

Both of the last two Presidential Administrations have suggested this fallback course. However, to get any significant improvement in fuel utilization, reprocessing is necessary. Then one seeks to minimize the transport of weapons-grade and radioactive materials. Molten-salt fuel cycles with in-house reprocessing offer low pro.

Knorm nuclear fuel supplies contain up to 10 years of energy. However, much of this industry cannot tap because ores are uneconomic to extract, and the current reactor fuel cycle uses less than one-thousandth of that which it does extract. The absence of any naturally occurring fissile isotope puts Th at a further.

A reactor concept, which could approach full utilization of all actinide fuel, might stand a chance of providing the economics necessary to accomplish the extraction of low-grade ores, including both uranium and thorium for fission reactors. Such a concept should exhibit a high BG to overcome thorium's fissile disadvantage.

Advantages of the Molten State: One of the key advantages of the molten state is its ability to facilitate rapid diffusion of atoms or molecules. In this state, particles are highly mobile, allowing for efficient mixing and reactions to occur. Another advantage is the increased flexibility in forming alloys or composite materials, as the molten state enables thorough mixing of components. These advantages make the molten state a crucial stage in various industrial processes such as casting, welding, and materials synthesis.

Having the fuel in a fluid state allows out-of-core cooling, thereby avoiding structural components in fields of significant radiation damage. It also eliminates labor and material costs associated with fuel element decladding, dissolution, and fabrication. Fuel handling by pumps and piping should be less complex than solid fuel handling.

A fluid state system also facilitates on-site close-coupled fuel reprocessing. Out-of-core cooling of the molten salt allows the primary circuit to operate at low pressure; this reduces the severity of the environment and allows materials such as graphite for piping. That should reduce fuel cycle costs.

Due to low operating pressures, only the container materials impose temperature limits. With Mo alloys, 900°C appears to be an upper limit. Graphite structures should tolerate considerably higher temperatures. This could significantly advance thermal efficiency, which could attendantly reduce thermal pollution of the environment. High-temperature operation affords applications with existing.

The eutectic nature of the halide salts facilitates low-temperature operation in the near term by minimizing chemically-reducing corrosion problems with Mo-Fe alloys. With graphite, these problems may not exist. Off-eutectic compositions can also mean higher BG and thermal conductivity of salt.

The molten nature greatly benefits safety as well: an increase in temperature causes a strong decrease in fuel density. The inherent stability of this negative temperature coefficient will limit excursions. A self-regulating system may be possible, avoiding the need for control elements.

The nuclear industry has exclusively used the uranium fuel cycle to date, mainly because no fissile thorium isotope exists. However, once a thorium cycle proves viable, numerous advantages accrue. Because the burning of thorium begins much lower on the atomic weight scale than does uranium, little plutonium or higher actinides accumulate. The plutonium which does appear will be mostly 238Pu, a strong heat source which melts in concentrated form unless cooled. That hinders its use as a weapon.

Advantages of On-site Continuous Reprocessing: One of the primary benefits of on-site continuous reprocessing is the significant reduction in waste generation. By continuously reprocessing materials at the site, companies can minimize the amount of waste produced, leading to cost savings and environmental benefits. Additionally, this approach allows for greater control over the quality of the end product, ensuring consistency and reliability in the manufacturing process. Another advantage is the potential for increased efficiency and productivity since materials can be reprocessed immediately without the need for off-site transportation.

Continuous reprocessing minimizes the fuel inventory outside the reactor; the inventory in the core, piping, and heat exchangers represents almost the entire fuel cycle inventory. This greatly reduces the potential radiological danger of the reactor while increasing the neutron economy.

The advantages of a very fast neutron spectrum include: 1. Enhanced transmutation capabilities, leading to efficient conversion of long-lived radioactive isotopes into stable or shorter-lived isotopes. 2. Improved breeding of fissile materials such as plutonium and uranium, essential for sustaining nuclear reactions. 3. Higher energy neutrons can induce fission in a broader range of isotopes, expanding the potential fuel options for nuclear reactors. 4. Increased neutron flux facilitates faster neutron capture processes, enhancing material testing and production of medical isotopes. 5. Enhanced neutron penetration depth enables effective interrogation of materials for security and inspection purposes.

In HCFR, the fast neutron energy spectrum is notably rapid. Chlorine (atomic weight A = 36) is the lightest primary element in the salt, with only minor quantities of Na (A = 23) or K (A = 39). Consequently, there are no significant elastic scatterers present to moderate the neutron energy.

To exhibit threshold behavior for fission (Figure 2. 15), the hard spectrum enhances fission over capture. The result is that: 1. Reactivity per unit mass increases, decreasing the critical. 2. More actinides now fission usefully rather than just transmute into a higher-A actinide. 3. The 233U (α,2n) cross-section for producing 232U, a proliferation deterrent, increases. 4. Parasitic neutron capture by fission products and structural materials decreases, thereby improving the neutron economy and decreasing the sensitivity of those materials.

In a plutonium-fueled MCFR, the high actinide density, the absence of core internals, and the very fast neutron spectrum can combine to raise BG up to 0ey. A 233 U/th system could probably be the good neutron economy can be diverted to other advantages such as smaller blankets, slower fission product cleanup, added Th in the core mix to reduce power density, cooling in-core, or operation at (lower) eutectic nadir operating temperatures.

MCFR (Th) neutronics will depend on the choice of reactor configuration, method of cooling, power density, operating temperatures, salt compositions, structural materials, and method of shim and safety control. Section 2 provides directives for choosing: usefully consume the actinides, use thorium as feed fuel, and maximize breeding. These all coincide with a supra-guideline: keep the core neutron spectrum as hard as possible. An intrinsic guideline is technical and economical feasibility.

Subsections 3. 1. 1 and 3. 1. 2 analyze how to maximize breeding by minimizing neutron moderation and leakage. Following subsections apply that knowledge to evaluate spherical vs. cylindrical geometry, one-zone reactor vs. core and blanket, other blanket aspects, reflector, damage shield, and method of shimming. Maximizing Breeding by Minimizing Neutron Moderation in the Core, 3. 1. 1 BG potential. Conversion of fertile to fissile fuel depends upon capturing the excess neutrons in the chain reaction. Each time a 235 atom absorbs 2 neutrons, the number of neutrons potentially.

Cutting the reactor vessel will obviously reduce leakage. Few of the reflected neutrons will make it through the outer blanket to return to the core. A thermalizing reflector would, therefore, have little effect upon the core spectrum, particularly if the outer blanket region is fairly thick (in mean free paths).

Such a reflector would enhance neutron capture in the blanket (both in carrier salt as well as in fertile). It would also decrease Py somewhat. The net change in 2G would depend on how the competing capture cross sections change as neutron energy decreases. This is.

Cu and Ni are well-known for their ability to reflect fast neutrons. Fe and Pb reflect almost as well and cost less. All four qualify as inelastic or heavy-elastic scatterers. However, at a blanket thickness of 200 cm, the choice of reflector material matters little. Then the low cost and low activation of graphite.

The first two factors directly affect reactor design. Minimum critical mass actually matters little: the fuel utilization issue pertains more to total cycle inventory, while proliferation deals with the availability of attractive weapons-grade or carcinogenic material. The fourth factor affects just the methods used for survey calculations.

Cylindrical geometry offers choices similar to 0.1-2: BG in (c) of Figure 3.1-6 may be slightly higher than in (b) when the core fuel is all fissile, and no fertile BG in (a) will probably be lower due to spectrum degradation. Likewise, the replacement of the annular core (c) by near-equivalent-area tubes (d) may further increase BG. Either each tube approaches criticality, or they approach each other in distance closely.

Design (d) also suggests quick and cheap replacement; a simple solution to the problems of radiation damage and corrosion in the reactor. Structural tubes obviously produce no fission products if made of graphite; they also radiate no gammas. That should facilitate their handling and disposal. Graphite also costs little. A design with straight tubes would limit replacement downtime. Design (d) is also easier to make and replace.

The degradation of the circle might be several mean free paths in diameter so that most neutrons leaving the side don't reach tubes on the other side.

A question certain to arise over core tubes is the interdependence of their neutronics and kinetics. One prefers either close or near-zero coupling between them: intermediate loose-coupling could lead to oscillations, not quickly damped. Behavior as independent reactors (zero-coupling) would probably require multiple control panels and operators; i. e. , separate full-power cores sharing the same blanket. This option might warrant attention as the tubes would share the same reprocessing plant and other facilities as well without affecting each other's operation. Since the reactor physics of each reactor would simply copy that of a conventional core and blanket reactor, this study will not treat it separately. Close neutronic coupling implies physical closeness as well (separated by less than one mean free path) and individually far subcritical.

From the reactor cannot breed. They also require shielding. Lengthening the core helps, but an axial blanket stops axial leakage best. Figure 3. 1-9 suggests some designs which accomplish that by dampening the chain reaction in the tubes near the top and bottom of the reactor vessel.

Should be ease of making and replacing the tubes; otherwise, one must design for corrosion and high neutron radiation exposure. The two skewed tube designs should excel in this regard because the tubes are straight. The chain reaction in these would confine itself to prolate or oblate spherical geometries. The critical geometry for the other three designs would more resemble a cylinder.

The next two designs exhibit large bends. Presumably, one would use straight pieces to the extent possible and fasten them to the bends, a cumbersome procedure in a radiation environment. The ballooned tube design presents even more difficulty to make. In conclusion, the use of a few (N=3 or 4) large skewed tubes should present the least engineering difficulty in their fabrication, operation, and replacement. It will also minimize.

Spherical geometry maximizes BG by minimizing neutron leakage but presents engineering difficulties. It also limits the power density: since critical masses are smaller in spherical geometry, power densities rise. Varying the core length in cylindrical geometry provides more choice in the critical mass and power density. The spectrum remains hard.

One can also use multiple small cylindrical tubes; some spectrum softening occurs there depending upon their proximity. The optimum configuration may be a small number (e. g. , three) of skewed tubes penetrating a cylindrical tank. The effective geometry of the neutron distribution will then closely approach.

Cut off the core through piping to the external heat exchanger, circuit, and its environs. The large fuel inventory might penalize the economics of a 23 U- or Pu-based plant for an MCFR(Th); the penalty matters less because thorium abounds more. The feed requires no enrichment or fabrication, and the plant achieves near-full actinide utilization. Large fuel inventory also works against non-proliferation goals, but not as seriously as if it occurred out-of-plant in transport, reprocessing, or fuel fab.

Earlier Taube studies concentrated on in-core cooling. Taube cautioned that the loss of delayed neutrons out-of-core might hurt reactor control. Later work emphasized out-of-core cooling to achieve high flux in outer and test reactors and high.

Flowing through 23,000 Monel alloy tubes in the core, a pump stirred the fuel in the vessel to a speed of 2 m/sec to increase the heat transfer. That much Mo meant large neutron absorption (3. 3% of the core total). The core inlet and outlet temperatures were 750 and 793°C. A main question was the weldability of the Monel alloy tubes.

A Winfrith group examined Taubes' work. They found his breeding gains slightly high due to expected deficiencies in the Bondarenko cross sections for 238 and Pu. Also, they found the physical properties of the salt not to be as good as what he used. These differences would increase the maximum.

The principal problems occur with mixing and separating the fuel and coolant, and corrosion. The need for extensive research to overcome these led to the abandonment of this method of cooling. Constant bleed-off of the blanket salt (for reprocessing) and replacement by cold MaCl/TCl4 may satisfy the heat removal require.

One way to achieve this is to increase leakage from the core (but not from the reactor) by reducing the core dimension in one or more directions. A thin cylinder is one logical solution: above a given length-to-diameter ratio, the length can infinitely increase without appreciably changing the core. However, space requirements and return piping do impose practical limits on the length.

In the skewed tube configuration, the effective geometry, where the tubes come together, can vary from minimal core leakage when angles between tubes are equal and near perpendicular to high leakage when tubes penetrate the vessel's top and bottom or from the vessel sides (L=9).

A third way is to increase the carrier salt concentration (decrease the molar percentage of actinide salt). However, this will soften the neutron spectrum and decrease the BG potential. This would not decrease the BG proliferation hazard of the material; any material that can sustain a chain reaction in a fast reactor can do so even easier in a bomb configuration.

This should increase the economics since the capital equipment, including that for reprocessing, changes more slowly. However, two or more small reactors at a plant may excel over the larger one; though each one requires separate instrumentation and operating crew, while one is down, the other still uses the reprocessing system and produces electric power. Without significantly coupling the cores, the blankets of several reactors might also abut one another so as to eliminate the reflector and enhance breeding.

In theoretical studies, Taube considered velocities of 10-16 m/s in the heat exchanger, choosing 14 m/s as optimum. The British varied v from 4-11 m/s in their NCFR heat exchanger. ORNL designed an MCFR heat exchanger with a fuel salt velocity of 6. 1 m/s.

Numerous criteria will limit the primary circuit temperature. Figure 3. 2. 4 illustrates the discussion. Temperature could increase the feasible ΔT and thereby provide extra heat transfer driving force. This would then reduce the needed intermediate heat exchanger area and, thereto, the external fuel inventory. Temperatures above 900°C allow operation with He as the secondary coolant. Even higher temperatures would allow MHD topping cycles and increased efficiency in conventional heat exchangers.

Primary circuit O. G. across heat safety exchanger; at, across core; on temperature difference. Fuel salt across heat exchanger tubes, freezing: 1. static stresses; 2. dynamic stresses; 3. migration of alloy constituents leading to minimum temperature for coolant. Process heat at End A; heat at End B.

The British considered 970°C with He cooling and 810°C with Pb applications but warned of problems to be overcome; must exceed the salt melting point with an adequate safety margin. Although melting points of actinide chlorides decrease with transmutation, it might raise the melting point through the formation of complex compounds.

Two materials are of principal concern: Mo and graphite. Table 3. 2-I lists a range of properties for graphite. To find the largest AT property, Set 1 maximizes O and Ry while minimizing d and E. Complementary Set 2 should give the smallest AT. Table 3. 2-II shows.

A 0. 20-inch radius tube with a 50-mil wall thickness. Gq equals the reactor power divided by the core fuel salt volume of 1 m and pertinent variations thereof. With graphite Set 1 parameters, the sky's the limit almost. Set 2 parameters would allow a maximum ΔT of 162-166°C, depending on the exact power density. A safety factor of two would lower the maximum.

In other MCFRs, Figure 3. 2-5 summarizes the results of previous MSFR (Pu) designs. Taubes and the British He-cooled designs are perhaps the boldest in using higher Ts and ATts. Many designs use a lower melting salt (with lower actinide molar content) to operate the fuel salt below 700°C.

q = heat transfer rate (cal/s), U = overall heat transfer coefficient (cal/s · °C), R = outside tube radius (cm), Ri = inside radius (cm) of tube through which fuel salt flows, k = wall thermal conductivity (cal/s·°C), h = Film coefficient of intermediate coolant (cal/s·°C). This term is generally non-controlling in (2) above. L = tube length, N = number of tubes, ΔTm = temperature difference between fuel coolant and intermediate coolant (across the tube walls). 2-6.

This shows that the fuel salt film coefficient controls the heat removal. Going to a thinner tube will not help much. The significance of Mo would be that it would allow a wider and thicker (therefore more reliable) tube without heat transfer penalty.

Figure 3. 2-7 plots this relation, adding boundaries of power density (10 MWth/liter and AT < 300). A broad reference region lies sufficiently far from the limiting boundaries so as to not require advanced design development. To further broaden the reference region.

3. 2. 6 Primary Circuit Arrangement shows the need for transferring the core and blanket fluids to remote mentions the importance of reliability and plant factor. 3. 205e2 Location of pumps and heat exchangers. Both pumps and heat exchangers should closely surround the reactor as in Figure 1. 2, so as to minimize the fuel inventory in piping. Shielding from core neutrons, beyond that provided by the blanket, is not warranted as the primary coolant itself emits delayed neutrons. Placing the pump between the heat exchanger and the core inlet imposes a lower operating temperature on it. This should lengthen its service life and ease its design. 302. 623 Parallel subchannels. As each tube channel (of N total) leaves the core, it could split into M>2 subchannels, each with a small pump and/or heat exchanger. Such redundancy should increase the load factor and safety of operation. Small size would also make it easier and cheaper to build and replace the units, and easier to avoid criticality outside the core. However, as the number of pumps increases, the chance for a single pump failure does also.

Several alternate arrangements are possible (Figure 3. 2-8). Plan A schedules a single pump and heat exchanger for each channel. Plan 3 splits the flow outside the core into more than two parallel paths, each with a pump and heat exchanger. Plans C and D only duplicate pumps. Thus, in 3, C, or D, a single pump failure does not terminate all flow.

If M=2 subchannels in plan C represent regular and backup paths, then each can handle the full flow, and one is always ready in backup; just need to switch a valve. Figure 3. 29 shows a top view of such a 2-plan. Use of multiple (M=2) subchannels, especially for pumps, should increase reliability and ability for reduced power operation but may also increase fuel inventory, auxiliary heating, and friction.

3. 26. 4 Tube channels in series. For a skewed core (recommended on the sides of the reactor), to avoid excessive piping and fuel inventory, the outlet of one tube should connect to the inlet of another, which lies vertically below. Page 362-10 attempts to describe this. It's as if someone ran a needle and thread through a cylindrical cushion, coming out the top. The thread returns outside the cushion to another entrance point on the bottom. This continues until the thread returns to the starting.

Figure 3. 2-11 shows a B-type horizontal M=2 design. Here, the tubes penetrate sides rather than the top and bottom. This should simplify the reactor support and reduce the out-of-core inventory as well. A physical model would be three pencils lying across each other, penetrating an approximately square cylinder of (blanket) jello. In the reference context, a small number of skewed tubes connect in series. Alternate subchannels with pumps in each could provide backup but would add friction losses. Online backup (to avoid reactor shutdown) would also increase inventory and auxiliary heating. Keeping N to 3 or 4 should help the system reliability as well as reduce the time required for repair and maintenance.

Limits on power density may arise from various factors such as radiation damage due to high flux, high temperature of the fuel coolant leading to seal expansion, metal melting, or chemical corrosion, and high fuel inventory impacting economics, doubling time, and reactor control. The use of replaceable graphite for the material in contact with the fuel coolant in the reactor and primary circuit could be a potential solution to these challenges.

3:3. +1-1 Neutron Spectrum. We desire as hard a neutron spectrum in the core as possible, though not at the expense of BG. Since non-fissile constituents mainly downscatter and capture neutrons, this means maximizing the ratio of 233y to all other isotopes. In the blanket, a softer neutron spectrum enhances neutron capture by the fertile material. Thus, neutron moderators might help.

Design and system chemistry. The success of the CRNL Molten Salt Reactor Program shows that it can be done, at least up to their power levels. Experience there also revealed that the chemical states often behave as if in equilibrium. This allows much progress towards understanding interactions within the salt (chemical stability) and between the salt and its environment (corrosion) since many of the equilibria are grossly predictable.

The free energy of formation of the compounds, Ac, measures the chemical stability of the salts, specifically their ability to resist forming other compounds which precipitate out. Taube has deduced the temperature-dependent ΔG for salts of interest (Figure 3. 3-1).

Eutectic behavior: the mixing of two salts lowers the melting point far below that for either salt by itself. The amount of lowering depends on the molar ratio of the two salts. An exceptionally low temperature is possible at the eutectic point or nadir. This may be of special value for the blanket region where little heat is.

Adding a third component like a second actinide salt in Figure 3. 3-4 can further lower the melting point, especially when all three are in near-equal proportions. Unfortunately, many multicomponent (ternary or higher) phase diagrams are unknown or unavailable in Russian literature.

The viscosity of salt mixtures is generally unavailable. Figure 3. 3-6 does show viscosity behavior for two salt mixtures: first MgCl2 with NaCl, then with ThCl4. (Note that the two sets of pure MgCl2 measurements do not agree. The latter Russian work is particularly suspect because of other errors found there. Still, the data are informative here. ) The bumps correspond to the formation of a complex.

Thermal conductivities of individual salts, all from Russian sources. For other salts and salt mixtures, one must rely on phenomenological models. Knowing room-temperature k for a salt does not help in predicting k(T) of the liquid. Figure 3. 3-10 shows how k changes with temperature as a salt passes from solid to liquid state. Gambill proposed that two distinct mechanisms determine k for fused salts: 1. Atomic or lattice conduction along the short-range atomic or molecular order present in liquids.

The usefulness of this formula depends upon the confidence developed in it. Gambill had no data with which to test it. Attempts to fit the available (Russian) data for individual salts fail dramatically. Dominantly depends on part 2; which has a negative T-coefficient while experimentally dκ/dT is positive. For ionic (second term), the "T" factor overrides the negative T-dependence in Fe but only up to a certain temperature. Overall, this approach fails.

The few measurements of chloride mixtures available—RbCl/UCl4 and CsCl/UCl mixtures (-12 and 3. 3=13)—show that k fluctuates dramatically with molar composition. The oscillations may correspond to the formation of complex molecules, just as occurred with viscosity data. This behavior suggests that one might yet achieve high k = k (pure carrier salt), even for high actinide molar composition and when & (pure actinide salt) is much lower.

In summary, Gambill's formula for (TL) proved successful with fluoride mixtures; with chloride salts, it appears to succeed better with salt mixtures than with the individual salts. Certain mixture compositions should give a k comparable to that of the individual carrier salt. For the mixtures of concern here, the covalent actinide chloride tends to control the temperature dependence of k as it varies much less than the carrier chloride salt. To obtain high thermal conductivity, both experiment (.

The CRNL MSR program shows that fuel salt circulation is feasible. It is facilitated in part by the lowering of melting points in eutectic multi-component mixtures. Chemical stability and corrosion of the molten salts are fairly predictable.

This study centers on Cl and F, for which much literature exists. Br and I are also possibilities which we peruse only superficially. Economics, availability, and salt stability probably preclude their neutron-moderating effect. The halogen will be the principal light material of the system. Thus, chlorine (Cl=36) will produce a much harder neutron spectrum than fluorine (F=19), satisfying a principal core guideline. A soft neutron spectrum in the blanket may.

Absorbs significantly less than Cl (table 3. 3+VI), which further recommends F for the blanket. Numerous workers have suggested enriching the chlorine in 31), as 356, contributes most to absorption at thermal energies. However, despite the fact that 371 has the low level density of a magic nucleus (W=20 neutrons), its S-wave strength function (7,/p) and gamma width fy will be near the same at fast neutron energies. Thus, no immediate evidence.

Higher the boiling point, the greater the ultimate temperatures which may be employed. Boiling points above 1500-1600°C would allow maximum high-temperature operation with graphite. Thus, one desires a carrier salt with a low melting point and high boiling point. Since the eutectic behavior applies only to the melting points, these goals are not as contradictory as they first seem.

Comparing the boiling points of chlorides and fluorides, one concludes that generally the fluorides are less volatile, especially for alkaline earths. Unfortunately, the higher melting points and moderating properties of the fluorides discourage their use in the core. This section surveys the chemical stability of the halides in the system (tendency to break up) and their corrosiveness (tendency to chemically attack the structural materials in the primary circuit at the temperature of concern).

Figures 3. 3-22 compare the stability of some chloride and fluoride compounds: the lower the ΔG, the more stable. NaCl and LiF are particularly good. In general, chlorides are less stable than fluorides. This pattern of decreasing stability with halide atomic number continues through bromine and iodine.

The small ΔG values for MoCl and MeCl inhibit their formation, which is why Fe is a preferred structural material in a chloride system. Graphite also resists chemical attack (formation of CF4 and CCl4) well.

Chlorides generally dissolve in 4. 0 fluorides do not. Inside the molten salt circuit, the presence of oxygen or water will produce oxy-chlorides (CCl), which corrode. Outside the reactor, water solubility may facilitate cleanup of leaks or spills.

Obvious cost and availability advantages for chlorine over fluorine. The scarcity and cost of Be for an F/Li/Be mix (necessary to achieve low F melting temperatures) tilt the scale even more in favor of Cl. Density: The power needed for pumping the core salt depends directly on its density; heat transfer, on the other hand, increases with it.

Fluoride HSBR and chloride CFR (Pu) concepts are 3. 2 and 3e1¢/cm, respectively, indicating little difference due to halide choice. In the core, Cl permits a hard neutron spectrum. Chloride costs less, melts lower, and is more chemically stable. However, fluorine, which moderates better and absorbs fewer neutrons, could considerably enhance breeding in the blanket.

Actinides are inherent to an MCFR (Th). Since only thorium crosses the plant boundary as feed replacement material, the principal actinides in the system will be Th and U isotopes with Au-232 to Au-234. Pa and Np in early reactors will produce some Am and Cm, but these fission usefully. Later reactors will start up on breakey-233. Points for actinides in the +4 (IV) state clearly lie below those in the +3 (III) state. Eutectic mixtures tend to follow this trend. This recommends the +4 (IV) state for the blanket, which generates less heat.

In the core, some UCl will pick up free chlorine to form UCl₂. By itself, UCl₂ corrodes, but not when UCl₃ predominates (i. e. , when the stoichiometry is near 3 Cl atoms to 1 U atom). UCl₃ may be present in the core as a critical mass diluent or negative shimming agent or simply be carried over in blanket reprocessing. It can also coexist with fuel without any deleterious effect.

Ionically-aggressive ACI, as well as a small change in valency, transmutation of K produces long-lived radioactivity and divalent calcium. The magic proton number of Ca causes the existence of numerous stable and quasi-stable Ca isotopes. These mostly transmute into themselves, yielding nil radioactivity.

Table 3. 3-XI shows the possible UCL molar contents under various temperature restrictions. RbCl excels for a 550°C limit; KCl or RbCl for 600°C. At 650°C, all alkali chlorides show potential, though KCl and CsCl excel. Alkaline earth chlorides don't work until the low-temperature limit exceeds 700°C.

Ternary mixtures can further lower the melting point. Figure 3. 3-26 presents four ternary diagrams for UCl, UCL, yAkCl, where Ak=alkali or alkaline earth. One desires to optimize the UCl/UCL ratio so as to hold down temperature (which affects corrosion) as well as the content of corrosive UCL. Keeping the U/Ak ratio high maximizes spectrum hardness and BG potential. Unfortunately, the isotherms and the eutectic m. p. tend away from high UCL content. Ternary mixtures with two AkCl components behave similarly (Fig. 3-27). In summary, one must trade off low melting point (low U-III content) and corrosion (high Ak content) against large spectrum.

The blanket salt will generate little heat; therefore, a low melting point temperature will facilitate its handling. High the content maximizes suitable eutectics with the small amounts of fuel present (0. 329). PoCi has a slight disadvantage in that Pb is divalent, further increasing parasitic capture by chlorine.

Fluoride blanket salt presents another alternative; it could best lower the melting point and thermalize the blanket neutron spectrum without parasitically capturing neutrons. NaF looks next best. However, fluorides solidify near 700°C, and eutectic effects do not appear until the THF molar content falls disastrously low to 20% (Figs. 323-32). Chlorides melt much lower.

Ternary mixtures of THE, UP, and AKF behave like their chloride counterpart; no eutectic points occur with high THE content. Mixing in two carrier salts with THF doesn't help either (Fig. 3. 3-33): the well-known MSBR salt Flibe (BeF2/LiF) combines with UF4 to reach melting points of 400-500°C but only at 12%.

-6 showed higher halides to have lower melting points; however, they have other problems: boiling point and vapor pressure. Chlorides of Ca, X, and Mg all boil in the same range, 1400-1600°C. Their differences are insignificant because UCl3 (792°C) and TiCl4 (928°C) pose much lower limits. The boiling points of UCl3 and PuCl3 are unknown.

Summary: Table 3. 3-XIII summarizes the intercomparison of carrier salt cations. The goal of keeping the core spectrum hard discourages the use of Be and Li because of elastic downscatter. Ca and K exhibit the least downscatter. Na undergoes the most inelastic scatter, with Ca and K exhibiting the least. Parasitic neutron capture, though small, exceeds by magnitudes for Li and K over that for Ca, Mg, and Na. Ca transmutes the least into radioactivity or troublesome chemicals.

Cation choice on the basis of eutectic melting point depends on the range of acceptable actinide molar contents. Boiling points for carrier chlorides play no role as they far exceed those for actinide chlorides. The chemical stability of the alkali chlorides (NaCl and XCl) surpasses that of the alkaline earth chlorides (MgCl2 and CaCl2). NaCl abounds by far the most in nature and costs the least. Salt density affects pumping power needs, but the higher densities of the actinide chlorides dwarf any differences due to carrier salt choice. The light alkalis transfer heat the best.

In summary, NaCl costs little and exhibits good physical and chemical properties. K and Ca feature better nuclear properties for the core salt, but the much higher Cl concentration obscures them. Na and Ha look best for the blanket salt. The final choice must weigh these relative advantages plus the location of eutectic melting points near.

Heat transfer coefficients for different materials are essential for understanding and predicting heat transfer processes. These coefficients play a crucial role in various engineering applications where heat transfer is a significant factor to consider.

In the core, we want to avoid nuclei which neither fission nor breed, but only downscatter and capture neutrons. This means maximizing the fissile enrichment and the ratio of actinide-to-carrier salt. It is also important to maximize the fuel salt heat transfer coefficient at an average fuel temperature of 800-850°C.

UCL, ratio here refers solely to that within the primary loop. The addition of helium to the core salt mixture should markedly increase the critical core radius, thereby decreasing the power density. This causes the core flux level to decrease, which extends the life of the core tubes, and decreases the damage flux to the vessel, which extends its life. The primary coolant power density in the heat exchanger to decrease out-of-core fuel inventory and ease heat exchanger stresses. Lead to an optimum Th/J ratio where the primary circuit fissile-inventory is a minimum.

- obtained a similar result. 3. Increase internal (core) breeding, which reduces the necessary size of the outer blanket, reduces the import of a reactor. 4. Soften the neutron spectrum, which decreases the BG potential of the reactor, inhibits the useful consumption of higher actinides, nullifies a small part of the flux decrease from the dilution because of the average fission cross sections.

For a 2:1 PdCl2/UCl3/6. 5 WCl mixture, Taube and Dawudi in 1956. However, neither Taube nor ORL indicate any experimental basis; whereas the J recommended here is based on recent (Russian) measurements. This reduction in perp by more than a factor of three increases h by roughly 50% over previous studies.

In this work, 303. 526 Heat transfer coefficient. With the above bases, and assuming: (1) The algorithm developed for h, in Section 3. 2. 5e1. (2) A salt velocity in the heat exchanger of 14 meters per second. (3) An inside tube diameter of 0. 40 inches. (4) us u. ,,, (for these survey purposes). The film coefficient for various mixtures and temperatures becomes.

The only other value available for comparison is the ORNL. He = 0. 38 cal/s on Ke Table 3. 3-A4VII shows that the factor of 3 increase here is predominantly due to a doubling of fuel velocity and an eightfold decrease in viscosity. The latter is mostly due to more recent information and higher temperature, and partly contingent on picking a composition with eutectic-like effects on viscosity.

Choice of core mix: A pure fissile fuel would produce the hardest neutron spectrum, but an MSR requires carrier salt admixture to reduce the melting point. Adding fertile salt to the core mix helps reach BG potential by reducing leakage through increased fertile capture, but it also lowers the BG potential by softening the core neutron spectrum. Another consequence will be to increase the critical mass of fissile fuel and the core size. This will be good for power density (0. 5=15) and in-core to out-of-core inventory ratio (for control purposes), but there are limits to an economical plant.

The ORNL/56 design limited the actinide concentration to 17 mole percent actinide chloride. Of this, two-thirds of the actinide was fertile material. The prime motivation was to keep the Liquidus temperature below 500°C to avoid what were then exotic.

Fully explore the advantages of a hard spectrum: power density is reduced by using a geometry with high surface/volume ratio and limited fertile fuel presence (limited reduction in enrichment). By and large, the enrichment problem is ignored because all fuels have weapons capability, but 232 bearing 2335, the least so. The better thermophysical properties from higher carrier salt content are sacrificed for the sake of the highly-desirable hard spectrum and attendant high BG potential. Choice of blanket mix. Since the blanket generates little heat, it can avoid high temperatures.

To find materials of suitable strength and endurance, one must anticipate the environment and the response of materials to it. The environment encompasses radiation, temperature, pressure, fluid composition, chemical additives, condensation, and vaporization. Material response depends on mechanical strengths, metallurgical phases, and chemical interactions (corrosion).

Plant-life economics. Initial study usually suggests several economical materials. The material cost is important, but the true installed cost depends also on size, pipe schedule, system complexity, joint make-up, fabrication techniques, and labor rates. Downtime and life expectancy, functions of the material response, will affect the ongoing maintenance costs. Fortunately, metals usually have lower fuel and blanket salt mixtures containing fission products and other impurities. This may require a trade-off with system conditions such as lowering temperature, decreasing velocity, or removing oxidizers.

Moderate cost with reasonable life. Sometimes the environmental conditions change with time: The structural material must handle that or be changed also. Experimental loops under similar reactor operating conditions are thus invaluable; they allow one to examine actual corroded pipe, valves, and fittings. Many factors can affect corrosion, some of which may be obscure. The questions below help in evaluating them: 1. What is the composition of the corrosive fluid? 2. What is the concentration (specific gravity, pH, etc. )? 3. What is the operating temperature and pressure? 4. Is water present at any time? 5. Is air present, or is the opportunity for air leaks high? 6. Is the system ever flushed, rinsed, or drained out? 7. Is a slight amount of corrosion objectionable from a contamination standpoint? 8. Has any specific trouble or problem been experienced with the materials being, or have been, used for valves? 9. What were the comparative lives of the materials used? 10. Are there special fabrication, handling, or installation? 11. What is the estimated installed cost or capitalized cost for the projected life of the piping? Metallurgical structure markedly affects corrosion resistance.

In the process of attack, metal ions leave anodic areas of the surface and enter into the solution, thus dissolving the surface. This creates an etched effect. In the solution, they chemically react with other elements such as oxygen, chlorine, etc. , to form nonmetallic compounds. The plateout of these darkens the surface with a protective, passive film. Examples include rust on iron, oxide layer on aluminum, and passivation of stainless steel by immersion in nitric acid.

While they remain intact, such films generally protect the metal or at least retard further degradation. However, high stream velocities, vibration, and thermal shock can all break the film continuity. The pickling of pipe to remove mill scale illustrates controlled corrosion by direct attack.

Galvanic action, or bimetal corrosion, exemplifies another common mechanism. Two dissimilar metals establish an electrical potential when they contact or connect by an electrical pathway in the presence of a conducting solution (electrolyte).

In bolted joints, such as pipe flanges, the relative sizes of the anodic and cathodic areas become important. An anodic area that is small in relation to the cathodic area accelerates the corrosion. Where flanges and bolts are of dissimilar metals, the bolting metal.

The use of lined piping systems for corrosive surfaces is rapidly increasing. Linings include glass, plastics, elastomers, and various metals. Lined pipe systems usually rely on carbon steel as a main structural component; ease of fabrication and low cost permit its use with most linings and manufacturing techniques. Glass-lined steel pipe has one of the broadest ranges of corrosion resistance of all. Its smooth surface improves product flow, but it has poor impact and thermal shock resistance, requiring care and handling during installation and maintenance.

The study of chemical reactions in a Molten Salt Cooled Fast Reactor (MCFR) is crucial for understanding the behavior of such reactors. These reactions play a significant role in the efficiency and safety of MCFRs.

Compatible containment materials are those which do not form stable chlorides. Examples are graphite, iron, nickel, and the refractory metals. The chlorides of the pure fuel salt are highly stable, reacting little with materials they contact. However, over the reactor life, the core and blanket salts will mutate into a variety of compositions, begetting additional chemical species: fission products and free chlorine from fission, other mutants through neutron capture, oxygen creeping in through seals. Fortunately, fluid systems can reprocess continuously (Section 3. 7), which helps to keep these impurities low.

The FP will only form chlorides if the free enthalpy of formation exceeds about 20 kilojoules per mole chlorine; FP up to and including molybdenum in -4-1. The gases xenon, krypton, and probably iodine and bromine are inert to chloridization, so are the more inert metals such as palladium, technetium, ruthenium, rhodium, and probably tellurium. Based on MSRE experience, they will either entrain with the inert.

Molybdenum, as a fission product with a yield of 18% (out of 200%) of all fission products, may remain, in part, in metallic form. When molybdenum is the structural material, the corrosion problems of metallic molybdenum or its alloys are strongly linked with the fission product behavior in this medium. Fission fragment MoCl will react with UCl to form UCl plus Mo. Likewise, the excess chlorine released will react with the strongest reducing agent present, VCl3, to form UCl3. This highly corrodes container metals, but both theory (stability of corrosion product chlorides) and laboratory experience show that dilute UCl3 fuel salt attacks little: alloys of iron, nickel, or refractory metals such as molybdenum resist chloride fuel and blanket salts, providing the UCl3-Cl2 mix contains no more than a few percent UCl3. Alloys can also include minor amounts of more reactive metals such as chromium if the design allows for some surface leaching.

The high flux levels in an MCFR suggest high radiation damage. However, due to the unique tube configuration, the only exposed structure is the core/blanket interface; the blanket shields the vessel, reducing its radiation dose by three magnitudes.

Materials in the secondary and possible tertiary circuits will face a much milder environment. However, the amounts of materials there greatly surpass those in the primary circuit, thereby sensitizing their cost: except for the high-temperature helium case, one prefers lower operating temperatures so as to allow cheaper materials. The cost factor, however, must also be balanced with factors of corrosion, thermal stress, and avoidance of secondary-coolant freezing (especially for active liquid metal) on the intermediate heat exchanger tubes.

Table 3. 4-II lists the most promising materials for use with different fluids. Strength considerations dictate the temperature limits. Corrosion tests under MCFR conditions have generally not been carried out yet. Materials that best resist corrosion by chemical attack should be those with a small free energy of chloride formation (0. 4-1). Low vapor pressure (high boiling and melting points) will also allow chlorides that form to remain as protective coverings.

Appear to be the only metals compatible with fuel and blanket salt. Superior strength and resistance to corrosion and radiation embrittlement at high temperatures recommend molybdenum alloys (particularly TZ) for contact with the circulating fluid.

There is some incentive for using molybdenum alloys for all the components (including pumps) that contact the salt. However, massive molybdenum outside the core would require precautions against its reactive components in a hot box, purged with an inert or slightly reducing atmosphere. An alternative to this would be to use duplex material.

For the less severe conditions of the reactor vessel and the salt ducts returning from the heat exchanger, Hastelloy-N or advanced developments of that alloy might suffice. However, having decided to use molybdenum for the core/blanket membrane, a change to a dissimilar metal elsewhere in the salt circuit could cause galvanic corrosion. Also, nickel alloys resist molten lead (2 candidate secondary coolant) very poorly compared with molybdenum; they would probably be subject to attack when the lead leaked through the heat exchanger into the salt. 3240342 Ho alloys. Tio offers high-temperature strength, good irradiation resistance, and high thermal conductivity: promising traits for a material in contact with fuel and blanket salts at high temperatures. However, fabrication of light molybdenum sections requires welding and heat treatment. This technology needs development, but it is already proceeding for other applications.

The use of molybdenum or its alloys may permit high fuel salt temperatures (above 1000°C). This can reduce fuel salt inventory through higher power densities and allow gas turbine cycles and/or process heat applications using helium as an intermediate and final.

And conduct heat well enough to warrant existing uses in heat exchangers and pumps. A resin-bonded graphite has found wide application in the chemical process industries. Both America and France have used graphite with LiF/BeF2 molten salt; McDonnell Douglas markets a high-strength, woven graphite for this. The French company PUK sells a product with graphite connected to heat exchanger material.

Tensile strength varies between about 500 and 3000 lb/in², up to 4000 or 5000°F if protected from oxidation (burning). Silicon-based coatings (silicides or silicon carbide) and iridium coatings are claimed to give protection up to around 2900°F.

Low vapor pressure of the primary and secondary fused salts permits thin-walled heat exchangers, highly efficient in heat transfer, thereby decreasing the necessary area and fissile volume out-of-core. However, assuming close pitch, they will require development.

Refractory metals are attractive as they can accommodate high temperatures while still affording the good heat transfer of a metallic material. A strong candidate is Mo. It does have an appreciable cross-section for neutron absorption; this affects delayed-neutron activation but not neutron economy or radiation damage there. Of greater concern.

It is greatly eased by assuming periodic replacement of the few tubes: an action far less complicated than the conventional replacement of fuel elements. Just drain the core and blanket and uncouple the tubes outside the reactor. This is especially feasible if one uses a cheap material like graphite. Section 3. 9, Access and Maintenance, discusses this further. Still, the tubes may experience a cumulative dose of 10^3.

3. 4. 6 Material for a Lead Secondary Circuit reason well, but might not if a steam generator leaked in small amounts of oxygen. Dissolving Mg or Ca as a getter in the lead would help lower the oxygen level but might not suffice. One could also clad the molybdenum with an alloy which resists oxygenated lead. Fecraloy, a ferritic steel containing aluminum, forms a protective alumina film under these conditions.

The possibility of making the heat exchanger tubes of Hastelloy W has only slight attractions; it would still need a Fecraloy or molybdenum external cladding to resist the lead, 3e4e6e2 remainder of the circuit. The ducts carrying the lead to and from the steam generators and also the steam generator shells might be molybdenum, protected from external oxidation either by a stainless steel cladding or by an inert atmosphere. An alternative.

The main change relative to the lead-cooled design is higher temperatures, parallel to a core temperature increase from 810 to 970°C. This suggests the need for molybdenum alloys, especially on mechanical grounds. However, even though there is no reason to doubt their corrosion resistance at this temperature, any supporting evidence is completely lacking. British studies showed that design variations might lower the salt pump operating temperature from 800°C to 670°C. This would ease the engineering and the selection of materials.

High levels of flux and power generation in the primary salt may extend far along the tubes. This will depend on individual tube subcriticality, distance of separation between tubes, and angle of their skew. For example, if they are near critical by themselves and are distant from one another, then their fluxes will follow a cosine distribution over the total distance between bends. However, increasing the intertube coupling will cause the fluxes within the tubes to fall off more steeply beyond the tube convergence region.

The concentration and other fuel salt parameters will also affect neutron distributions because they moderate the neutrons, which shortens their mean free path. Fluxes will also extend into the blanket in all directions but with much shorter relaxation lengths.

The choice of tube arrangement will depend upon a detailed trade study of effective core size. Extension of the chain reaction out along the tubes will increase exposure of the pressure vessel to neutrons emanating from the tubes. Making the core size small reduces stability of the system to perturbations.

All the tube wall material gets lumped into one spherical shell. The validity of this approach, versus uniform material distribution in the spherical core, will depend upon the number of actual tubes. For only three or four tubes, the current thinking, it should do quite well.

Taking the tube wall thickness to be two cm facilitates comparisons with MCFR (Pu) studies. The vessel wall is four cm thick in the reflector zone, 40 cm. A check calculation with 20 cm reflector thickness showed no significant changes when the blanket thickness.

A primary difference between an exact calculation and those in spherical geometry is likely to be the spectrum softening and other effects of the Thel/Nach blanket salt intermediate between the fuel salt tubes. Depending on the clearance and skew angle between tubes, a smeared model of such a spherical region would probably include 5-25% blanket salt by volume.

Cross sections for the two sets described above were averaged, assuming the materials to be infinitely dilute, i. e. , ignoring resonance self-shielding. In 2334, most of the reactivity effects from fission and capture self-shielding, if present, would cancel.

The Bondarenko-calculated self-shielding factors for capture (Table 3. 5-Iy) show virtually no self-shielding in the top 12 groups, which cover well the core and blanket spectra. That little does occur in group 12 for 73Zn. Doppler broadening partly ameliorates. 233y is similar. Thus, the infinitely-dilute calculations.

The Th cycle burnup chain as it pertains to reactor criticality, 2333p, branching by neutron capture to 2345 or by a decay to 2334 is very important in a thermal reactor where 234 only absorbs neutrons. However, in a fast NCFR (Th) spectrum 234y mostly fissions (Figure 2. i-5) — much more so than any other threshold-fission isotope. It does not significantly moderate the spectrum or otherwise detract. Production of 233pa follows directly from 232mm. 233 decays quickly enough to ignore its presence.

Thermal reactor, but a low-threshold fission cross-section raises it to fissile fuel status and also destroys it faster. Therefore, the reduced presence of 234, and the 233-like reactivity behavior of 2345 in an HCFR obviate the need for separating out 23354 to let it decay as in an MSBR. Therefore, it suffices in these survey calculations.

This might assist as a deterrent early in reactor operation due to the 2,6-HeV gamma signal, but being a different chemical element, Th will easily separate from the U fuel. Therefore, it plays no significant role here. No other isotope besides 2324 should be initially.

Will also contribute. The threshold nature of these reactions implies that 232 will build up much more in fast reactors than thermal ones. Magnitude comparison of the various paths can lead to some simplifications. Ignoring the delay from 25. 6h half-life decay of 31ph and 22.

A pertinent measure of the economics and physics of a breeder reactor is the time required to breed enough extra fuel to start up another reactor. That should really encompass the whole fuel cycle: core, blanket, primary loop, in-plant stockpiles, transport, fuel fabrication, fuel reprocessing, and out-of-plant storage.

However, perhaps because solid fuel reactors all require similar ex-reactor fuel cycles, DI conventionally measures just the time for duplicating core and blanket. To facilitate comparison, this study adopts that definition also except that the MCFR must also include its full primary circuit contents.

Indicates the volume Vy = 203 Pe. UL = Blanket U content. This should result in a conservative comparison of the MCFR fuel cycle to the solid fuel cycle of other breeder reactors: solid fuel will require much more inventory in storage, transportation, decladding, and fabrication operations than the MCFR, little.

In contrast, when skewed to the maximum, the tubes closely approach one another only near their midpoints. Then no tube sustains the neutron chain reaction very well outside the close-approach zone. The critical geometry of that zone should resemble a square cylinder (L/D=1); somewhat squeezed at its middle into the shape of an hourglass or a wheat stack.

The differences in Vs correspond to the differences between zero and maximum skew angle, respectively. Thus, the true results would lie intermediate. For the present study, we take Vv at some low value, which should result in a conservative estimate of DP.

Figure 3. 5 shows how increasing b quickly reduces U to nil. The total U inventory (U,) then comprises just the primary circuit contents, U + U 0°. Meanwhile, u, rises from oblivion to its maximum level. Since u, and ue vary with b in opposite directions (0. 5-10), Core 2334/234y ratio also varies markedly with b.

A rate of 10°/s implies the removal of 1 ppm of the U per second, or a complete processing of that zone every 11. 6 days. Though that may be doable, a rate of 10/s or full processing in 116 days seems more reasonable while imposing no severe penalty.

Detailed analysis in other studies shows the same B and C behavior patterns there. Thus, we adopt BEC=107 SS as a reference for this work. We also conclude that physical reprocessing limitations should not prevent us from achieving near-optimum 2334/73 Ay ratio.

Fixed reactor diameter, which controls the overall plant size; an inner blanket does not appear worthwhile relative to just increasing the outer blanket thickness. Furthermore, even if marginal BG advantages were found, the added engineering complexity would probably discourage it.

To determine the optimum outer blanket thickness, a study was conducted. The study aimed to identify the ideal blanket thickness for the breeding gain (BG) assuming no inner blanket. Various ThC1, UCL, molar ratios in the core were considered, specifically 0, 1, and 3. The study also analyzed the NaCl molar content in the fuel salt.

To a C wall, as the 204 Ho dominated the neutron absorptions there assumed in-core cooling with the tubes occupying 5. 95% of the core volume. In the present MCPR(Ta) concept, the 2-cm tubes occupy several times that proportion of volume, but they lie more on the periphery.

Section 2—adduced goals: hard neutron spectrum, high BG, and minimum presence of Pu and other heavy actinides. Although lng content is not a design (independent) variable but rather a physics consequence (dependent variable), still design variables like NaCl/UCL/ThCL, molar composition can influence it. Therefore, we study its effects as if it were an independent variable, looking at 223 y.

Because 23by is a fissile MCFR fuel, the reactor U inventory varies, increasing with decreasing 234y content, reaching 0. 25 MI/yr for the ratio 2334/°3 hy = 7. Figure 3. 5-18 shows the consequent effect on doubling time. This recommends a high 233y/7 hy ratio, however.

Deducing the ratio on the equilibrium cycle. Given a set of specific the 233y/234y ratio. However, this ratio for the fuel cycle will depend on the reaction rates used. These, in turn, depend on the ratio assumed a priori in the neutronic analysis of the equilibrium fuel cycle. Figure 3. 5 suggests that the two converge.

To approach its BG potential (BGX or BGP), the reactor must capture its excess neutrons in fertile material. One means of reducing neutron leakage from the reactor is to thicken the outermost layer of the core to capture the neutrons which escape. Another way is to add fertile material to the core fuel, thereby reducing the core neutron leakage. However, this also softens the neutron spectrum, which lowers the BG potential (BGP).

When the blanket thickness exceeds 2. 0 m, however, few neutrons leak, and the reflector has little effect. "Th" = 0, then produces the greatest BG because it engenders the hardest neutron spectrum (0. 5-21) and, consequently, the most excess neutrons.

Section 5-20 also shows the BG from the 1956 ORNL study of an MCFR (Pu), which included a Pb core reflector and a graphite-moderated thin blanket. The larger VY value for Pu causes the high BG. Few neutrons leak despite low fertile content, but this is because of high (83%) carrier salt content. BG could actually be higher were it not for the spectrum softening and neutron absorption by the 345-9. 2 effect on reactor fissile inventory and doubling time. Substituting Th for UCL decreases density. However, the critical core radius increases near proportionally, and volume increases even faster. Thus, overall, Th dilution increases the spherical critical mass US (. 522) and the corresponding mass in the tubes US (from. 5-7). In contrast, the primary circuit volume outside the vessel, Vor, remains fixed, so U decreases.

The skewed-tube geometry will further increase the critical mass (lower the power density). A cylinder with length-to-diameter ratio (L/D) near 1. 0 requires about 10% more critical mass in low-density metal systems than does a sphere with L/D around 2; about 40% more. The heterogeneity of multiple skewed tubes further increases the critical mass, as does neutron capture and scatter by the blanket. In between the tubes, all these effects should reduce power density and fluxes by more than a factor of two compared to spheres.

Spectrum softening effect of ThCL content (-21) reduces the average fission cross section relative to the capture cross section, especially for even-A isotopes, which do not readily fission (Fig. 3. 5-26). This favors the accumulation of higher-A nuclides.

Like ThCl, NaCl substitution for UCL in the primary salt significantly reduces the fissile inventory outside the core tubes but also degrades the neutronic performance in the core. This section analyzes some of these physics consequences, assuming a core salt composed of zero ThCl and a 233/234 ratio of 7.

529 compares NaCl substitution relative to ThCl substitution on an expanded scale. One sees that Th diminishes BG slightly less than NaCl does. The probable reason is that most neutron capture in ThCl contributes to BG (even considering the four Cl atoms), whereas none of that in NaCl does. Table 3.

3. 4569-2, NaCl substitution for UCL increases the fissile inventory in the core tubes within the vessel; however, the larger inventory outside the vessel decreases faster. Thus, the total inventory (primary circuit plus blanket) decreases with increasing NaCl.

Shows how NaCl substitution for NaCl decreases the power density and flux levels; however, ThCl substitution causes an even faster decrease. In both cases, the blanket composition remains constant. Thus, the greater fall-off in flux from adding ThCl to the core salt must stem from the higher microscopic absorption cross-section for Th than for Na (Table 3).

Salts for UCL soften the neutron spectrum because it substitutes a source of elastic and inelastic scattered neutrons for one of fission neutrons. In a softer spectrum, the rate of 23 hy (threshold) fission decreases, and 2334 (-1/v) capture increases.

Differences between NaCl and The1 as salt substitutes appear to be small. NaCl mostly scatters elastically, while The1 scatters more inelastically. The different shapes of the NaCl and The1 curves should contribute more to spectrum softening at low non-fissile content, where the neutrons still exceed the inelastic threshold energy.

The combination of these factors defines the toxicity of an isotope - just how much of a practical threat it poses. Table 3,5-XI includes a toxicity classification along with other pertinent physics information. The moderate half-lives of Pu, plus their early preeminence in the actinide burnup chains, warrant their highly toxic classification. Carcinogenicity further emphasizes avoiding their production.

Numerous light elements (up through Al and Si) undergo these reactions with alphas. Figure 325-33 shows some relative yields. Fluorine, though not included there, reacts almost as strongly as Be. Li and Be are candidate materials for a (blanket) salt mix. This phenomenon argues against their use unless the neutron signal and hazard are desired for non-proliferation purposes. Section 3. 7 mentions the use of F, O, Igy, and Na with various reprocessing schemes. This phenomenon would discourage their use somewhat.

To remove most of this and other radiation, one could chemically separate the uranium in the core salt from the 20854 and all other actinides and fission products. However, this would not separate 2334 from 2325. Then, in only two weeks, the surface dose would again reach 1 Rem/hour. Furthermore, if only a 99% removal efficiency was achieved.

In addition to these complications, the tell-tale signals would continue to emanate from the separated waste as well as from the new regenerating source in the separated U. All these troubles must discourage subnational groups which contemplate taking and using.

The effect of such activity on the conventional solid fuel cycle would probably be to require costly shielding and remote handling to protect the workers. This means in fuel fabrication plants and, crucially, at the end stages of processing plants. A molten salt fuel cycle automates the reprocessing far more efficiently. The shorter time out-of-core should also reduce the activity due to neutron absorption reactions with each member of the decay chain.

Since 232 and 2334 are chemically inseparable, this radiation hazard will continue to manifest itself for many multiples of the 2325-year half-life; i. e. , for centuries. By leaving the breeding gain in chloride form, it is ready to start up another plant without.

That two meters constitutes an infinite outer blanket; in that event, a reactor reflector contributes little. In addition to achieving maximum BG, the 2 m blanket greatly reduces the flux dose to the wall material because Mo strongly absorbs neutrons.

Minimal presence of Pu and other high-A actinides. Fortunately, within the ranges of interest, all the trade studies indicate that the 233U/Pu ratio on the equilibrium fuel cycle will exceed 7. That is sufficiently high to achieve the above goals; additional major efforts are unwarranted.

Acting as diluents in the core salt greatly reduces flux levels and the amount of out-of-core fissile inventory. They also reduce BG. The combined effects of inventory and BG produce an optimum DT near a U molar composition of about 30% and a Th/U ratio of 1-2.

Efforts to lower DT should focus on the out-of-core inventory. Note also that, compared to conventional reactors, the absence of fuel fabrication and decladding operations, and the minimal transportation and storage needs provide additional fuel inventory advantages, which are not taken into account here.

Velocity of 9 meters per second, the fuel is present for only 0. 2 seconds. Each decay half-life of the six delayed-neutron groups (Table 3. 6-I) far exceeds that. Therefore, the delayed neutrons originate near uniformly throughout the primary circuit, and PRT diminishes by the ratio of fuel in-core to that in the total circuit.

For comparison, a Pu-fueled LMFBR typically exhibits, for a 1000 MWe MSBR, an isothermal temperature coefficient of -0. 9 x 10^7 Δx/°C. However, this comprised a 10^7 dk/k/°C for the negative Doppler coefficient of thorium and positive coefficients for the thermal spectrum graphite moderator and fuel salt density. The latter stems from a negative salt density coefficient of -0. 03 Δx/Se/p for their low-actinide fluoride salt mix.

Control of reactor power level by manipulating the secondary circuit conditions mainly involves varying the flow rate of salt through the core and heat exchangers. The negative temperature coefficients will hold the salt temperature nearly constant at all power levels.

In the primary circuit outside the core, fixes the effective delayed neutron fraction and affects the reactor stability. The British showed that an MCPR (U/Pu) should be stable to small reactivity perturbations if the fraction of primary circuit salt in the core exceeded 25%. Engineering studies of their MCFR designs met this requirement with margins. The primary circuit flow rate seemed to.

The fissile fuel salt in the primary circuit, assuming a power density of 11 MWh/liter and conservative heat exchanger performance, 81% of the fissile fuel salt is out of the core. For a given heat exchanger rating, as the total plant power decreases, the inventory in the heat exchanger will also decrease by about 0. 3 weight percent fuel per GWh. Little change occurs in the core or piping.

Figure 6-1 shows a typical British design with large heat exchangers to compensate for lower thermal conductivity values of the fuel salt. They have given considerable thought to reducing duct length but find that unconventional methods tend to be less reliable or less easily maintained. Increasing fuel velocity can reduce duct cross-sectional areas, but limits due to vibration and pumping power costs may occur.

Physical properties due to transmutations. As you transmute to actinides higher in Z, the individual salt melting points (excluding eutectic effects) lower. However, since uranium isotopes predominate in the burnup chain, very little higher-Z material appears. Similarly, boiling point and vapor.

Continual removal of volatile fission products from the salts during operation eliminates several obnoxious species from being present in an accident. Many of the remaining hazards would stay in the salt. Thus, no accident can occur which corresponds in severity of radioactivity to the meltdown of solid fuel systems.

Higher temperatures in the core salt may produce higher vapor pressures there than in the blanket. The core salt also circulates under pump pressure, while the blanket salt need not. If a reserve tank automatically replaced fuel salt leaking into the blanket, the system could simultaneously approach supercriticality and high temperature, a strong temperature coefficient notwithstanding. The high temperature could further abet the deterioration. In contrast, blanket salt leaking into the core would only dampen the criticality; however, this could result in degraded system performance.

An anomalous rise in concentration of 2334 or fission product in the blanket, a rise in temperature there (due to increased fissions), or a drop in core salt pressure would signal core-to-blanket leakage. Leakage of blanket salt into the core would decrease.

The secondary coolant circuit should be pressurized slightly higher above the primary one, and the tertiary even higher. This will cause less active coolants like helium or lead to leak into the molten salt. Helium is inert, and the salt cleanup system, which already separates the fission product gases, would remove helium as well. Lead interacts with nickel-bearing alloys, but not with iron or graphite. Traps at certain points in the circuit could locate the position of a lead leakage.

The containment building will catch leakage of volatile fission products from the primary circuit or blanket to the air, similar to MSRE, with appropriate detection and leak-tight barriers; pump failure can all reduce flow in the primary circuit. Figure 36-3 analyzes the consequences. In most events, the reactor shuts down, and the fuel drains to a safety tank where fission product decay and delayed neutron-induced fission continue to generate heat, but the high capacity of the salt restrains the temperature.

The effect of a single pump failure depends on the primary circuit arrangement. With single pumps per channel (Plan A in Fig. 3. 2-8), failure of the pump would shut down one whole core channel. The fuel salt in that core channel must then drain out to stop full power production in it. Subsequent replacement by void, blanket, or carrier salt would cause a large loss of reactivity, thereby shutting down the reactor.

Individually near critical, and missing reactivity could be added through enrichment. Then one could continue operation on a reduced scale; for example, 6/7 for six out of seven channels still operating, until a more opportune time occurred in which to drain the whole core and replace malfunctioning equipment.

With multiple subchannels per core channel, each with pumps and exchangers as in 2-8-B, C, and D, the failure of one pump still allows partial reactor operation until a better time for shutdown and repair. If one operated the Plen 3 or C subchannels or the plan D heat exchanger at less than full efficiency, then their full use is available in the event of one subchannel failure. This would, however, increase out-of-core inventory and capital costs though. Should the core tubes be connected in series as in Section, require system shutdown.

Should both regular and emergency power supply fail, all pumps would fail unless they are steam turbine-driven. However, electrically driven pumps are easier to include in the containment and also easier to supply for pre-testing, etc. Inertia would help electric pump run-down rates, or some short-term auxiliary supply might have to be provided until the full dump of fuel has taken place.

The strong negative temperature coefficient will control the temperature and power: initial temperature increase will decrease density, which decreases reactivity and thereby power, until some equilibrium state is reached. MCFR (Pu) studies with a simplified reactor model showed that the temperature rise of the salt for a reactivity step of up to 1 should be less than 300°C for 7 pumps failing out of S; less than 230°C.

In summary, it appears that reactor stability concern over out-of-core inventory may preclude the use of out-of-core subchannels as well as dictate series connection of the core channels. This means designing the system for high reliability to minimize shutdowns and for rapid repair of heat exchangers, piping, and pumps when shutdown does occur. Rapid repair will entail expedient removal of all the core salt followed by a salt flushing of all radioactivity from the system. The strong temperature coefficient should dispel.

And a blanket would lead to no chemical or compatibility problems. Dilution of the core salt will reduce reactivity only if the core salt were replenished as it entered and displaced the blanket; could a reactivity increase occur. Even then, the system could accommodate a temperature rise from moderate salt additions, as ample margin exists above the operating temperature on a short-term basis.

Vessel failure would require rapid dumping from both the circuit and the catchpots. Dump tanks should probably be sized to contain the contents of one secondary coolant circuit as well as all core and blanket salt. Relief valves on the secondary system will protect the primary circuit from pressurization resulting from a major steam generator failure into the secondary system.

In the event of a major circuit failure, operating pressure would play an important role in the subsequent fate of the fission products and the containment. The molten salts themselves exhibit low vapor pressures. Although high pumping losses can cause primary circuit pressures up to 460 psi, lead secondary coolant acts essentially like a hydraulic system with little stored energy. Missile formation is, therefore, unlikely, and it should be possible to demonstrate a containment that will not be breached from this.

With a high-pressure helium-cooled system, one must ask whether an accident might aerosolize the core salt. However, a properly designed reactor vessel could withstand the full helium pressure from a severe rupture between the coolant and primary circuits. Thus, the release of activity to the reactor containment cell would not occur except under a simultaneous double failure. The cell itself is small and can economically be made in the form of a prestressed vessel to withstand missile damage and to act as an additional barrier to fission product release. A final low-pressure building containment would prevent release from small leaks in the earlier.

In the tank, the salt will circulate naturally as heat from fission product decay transfers through tube wells to air convected by natural draft towers; otherwise, pressure would build up from salt vaporization. The absence of mechanical moving parts will make this whole system highly reliable. Multiplicity could add even further integrity. A forced draft system would probably lay out more compactly.

A second cooling option would circulate naturally a low melting point salt or NaK through U-tubes in the tank to boiling water heat exchangers. Air-cooled condensers, situated in a normal or forced draft stack, would condense the steam formed. Alternatively, the heat could transfer directly to two large boiling pools, thus accommodating decay heat for a protracted period without makeup. Condensers or make-up water would be provided for continuous operation.

A catchall salt bed below this apparatus would serve as a backup for any leaks or breaks. The heat of salt formation would greatly aid in absorbing decay energy. An independent cooling system might remove decay heat. The bed would also dilute the fuel salt. Proper choice of tank diameter would ensure subcriticality.

The removal of volatiles from the primary circuit still requires attention to their presence elsewhere in the plant. However, it should not be difficult to ensure the integrity of a storage medium below ground. After a suitable decay period, some of the gases may be releasable to the atmosphere.

Of liquid changes, sliding along the liquidus curve as crystals separate out (Figure 3. 6-4). With low initial UCL, molar content, cooling precipitates out NaCl crystals, thereby enriching the fluid crystals and NaCl-enriched fluid. In either case, the liquid migrates to the nearest eutectic point (nadir) composition and causes a concentration of UCl. Thus, one must consider possible criticality situations and design geometries to prevent them.

Containment: fuel element, reactor vessel, and then the containment building. The MCFR will feature reduced FP radioactivity due to continuous gas cleanup, but it will inherently have only double containment of piping and a building. A second radiation hazard arises from activation of the secondary coolant and nearby equipment by delayed neutrons in the primary circuit.

To further contain these hazards, a low-pressure leak-tight membrane might be formed around the walls, floors, and ceiling of the reactor system. This membrane can also form part of the ducting for the inert gas circulation required to cool the concrete structure and shielding and inhibit vessel oxidation. Heat losses with insulation restricting the concrete temperatures to below 70°C would be about 200 watts/m with 40 cm of insulation. This would equate to about 3 MN total heat removal by water or air cooling.

The main building would constitute the tertiary containment. Its volume must be sufficient to contain the stored energy of any gases present. In the lead-cooled design, these are cover gas volumes at low to moderate pressure. The helium-cooled version may.

326. 369 Resistance to external threat. One can postulate a number of scenarios wherein external explosion or impact threatens the reactor integrity directly or through a loss-of-coolant accident. These could involve ground or aerial bombs, planes, and space re-entry projectiles (e. g. , meteors, missiles, space laboratory).

In many or most of these situations, one could anticipate the danger. Most reactors already lie below ground level. Still, the vessels generally sit high enough to be rupture-prone to strong explosions or impacts. Such an incident could release volatized fission products and actinides of consequence, greatly exceeding a simple bomb or other initiating event.

ThCl is converted to ThCl2, mixed with reprocessed blanket salt, and fed into the blanket simultaneous with blanket salt removal. Blanket reprocessing separates out bred UCl (predominantly 3yc2), reduces it to UCl2, and admixes that to reprocessed core salt, forming the core shim material. This constitutes a spiked fuel, suitable for BG export as well as for positive reactivity shim to the MIFR (Th) core, simultaneous with irradiated core salt removal.

The III and IV states easily precipitate from aqueous solution as fluorides; the V or VI states do not. The IV and VI states appreciably dissolve in certain organic liquids; the III-state nitrates remain virtually insoluble in these liquids. The Ihorex version extracts 233 from the aqueous solution of irradiated.

5. Additional steps needed to produce solid wastes include separating from fission products and thorium fluorides. The ability to decontaminate to low activity levels parallels that for solvent extraction. However, the volatility method requires fewer steps and, therefore.

Pyrometallurgical processes to recover and purify fissile and fertile material from breeder reactors, although demonstrated on a pilot-plant scale, much engineering development remained to evolve a workable and reliable process, especially in view of criticality.

A typical process would use a molten chloride flux to contact the oxide fuel and a molten metal to extract the actinide. Hence, the need for high temperature (pyro). With molten chloride salt fuels, only the extractant is needed; for chloride fuels, Dillon proposed a Mg-Zn alloy. A similar metal may work with Th/U cycle.

Because of its compactness, pyrometallurgical process can operate close-coupled to the reactor and on a much shorter cycle than the aqueous route. If economical, a pyrochemical processing plant could easily be accommodated within the reactor building due to its small size. Preliminary work indicates that capital and operating costs may be high because of the small batch-type operations needed.

3. 7. 2 Core Salt Processing In the equilibrium cycle, the core fuel will include carrier alkali salt (e. g. , NaCl), fissile UC1, diluent ThCl2, actinide transmutants (e. g. , PaCl3, NpCl4, and PuCl4), impurity oxides, fission products in the products, and sulfur (from chlorine transmutation). Some of the mutants may form complex chlorides like CsUCl3 and compounds like UI3 and US4, which precipitate out at sundry temperatures. Core shim material must replace irradiated core salt nearly continuously so as to maintain criticality. The fuel burnup rate (1. 6 g/min for a 2250 MWe plant) fixes the rate of shim replacement. Actual core salt reprocessing can still occur batchwise or continuously. The choice will depend in part on the allowable inventory of core salt in reprocessing and the allowable level of FF concentrations in the core. The latter depends on: 1. The reactivity worth of FP, 2. The effect of a lower Th/U ratio or increased reactor size on reactor performance.

The salt or just recover the 23y01 and scrap the rest since NaCl is so cheap. Solid fuel cycles conventionally take the latter approach. Here we choose to clean up the salt because: 1. NaCl radioactivity precludes easy disposal. 2. Enrichment in Movaechosen would forfeit cheap cost. 3. Discarding non-uranium actinides would mean poor fuel utilization since every actinide atom can eventually fission in this spectrum. 4. Continuous gas removal gives a good start on salt cleanup. It might be feasible to just remove the parasitic neutron absorbers and corrosion agents; let the salt accumulate the rest of the mostly-radioactive non-volatile mixants, some as substitute carrier salt. The advantages are: 1. A suitable place to store non-volatile radioactive wastes. 2. The reactor will transmute many of the wastes into a less. 3. The radioactivity will add to the heat source. 4. The radioactivity discourages diversion of the core salt for weapons purposes. Potential disadvantages to watch for and control are: 1. Change in viscosity and other thermophysical properties. 2. Mutant plate-out causing flow blockage, radiation sources, or other problems. The enumerated advantages seem real enough to warrant this.

In remedy for the MSBR, CRNL proposed a cleanup system which recirculates gas in loops across each main salt pump. Injected helium nucleates bubbles which absorb gases, the small-particle fog of inert metals (Pd, Tc, Ru, Rh, and Te) and some of the volatile chlorides. While in a hold-up tank to reduce decay heat, some of the metals and chlorides deposit out. Passage through traps and beds removes Kr, Xe, water, etc. before returning to the helium injector. About 20% of the bypass flow undergoes a long delay in which all isotopes except the 10-year re-decay to an insignificant level.

Presently, areas levels from reactors are small enough to discharge directly to the atmosphere. Should nuclear power abound in 30-40 years, it may be necessary to separate out Bx. Low-temperature fractionation looks like a promising method.

One form of delay could be in a trough of swimming pool size. Low-pressure steam forms above the pool and passes to condenser units. Such a system would dwarf the reactor in size. Alternatively, one might store the gases safely and reliably at high pressure. It will remove the remaining 50-60% of the fission products as necessary unless online treatment processes can be developed.

Argues for consideration of the less-developed processes of section compounds react with UCl; to precipitate uranium oxides and oxychlorides. Oxygen can enter the salt through air, water vapor, or transmutation of F. The vagarious nature of air and water vapor entry necessitates keeping the oxygen content well below saturation.

Experiment indicates difficulty with simple methods of salt clean-up, such as the small change in solubility by temperature adjustment. An alternative effective method routes the bypass gas flow through a bed where the gas mixes continuously with injected liquid NaAlCl. Greater stability of AlCl3 causes it to form over AlCl2. The solid alumina then separates out by filtration or cyclone.

Removal of sulfur impurities. Several nuclear reactions convert chlorine to sulfur (Figure 3ETH4). Mass balance and Coulomb barriers combine to inhibit most of these reactions, but high flux should produce only small amounts of 345 (favoring a 31 q) enrichment again. A natural chlorine-fueled system will produce more sulfur than the salt solubility can handle. Phosphorus, though present, is only transitory, decaying quickly to sulfur.

The effect of the sulfur presence will, in part, depend on its oxidation state. For molten sulfur, the oxidation state equilibrium is fairly well fixed; the predominant state tends to be positive (+7 to +5). The positivity also increases when it initially binds three or four Cl atoms. Although fission splits each actinide atom into two product atoms, the net valency reduces (in part due to inert gases), and an excess of chlorine occurs.

First, extract uranium and immediately return it to the primary circuit. Subsequent steps proceed more slowly and sometimes tortuously. They especially include 233 Pa extraction by a liquid bismuth contact process and rare earth extraction. After 233 Pa decays to 235, it returns to the reactor.

Materials requirements: The processing plant may require special materials. The transfer lines will probably be molybdenum tubing; some of the large vessels may be graphite. For an MSBR, a frozen layer of salt protects the wall of the fluorinator.

Replaceable tubes would also permit variable core dimensions and composition. One might then even start with a slow neutron spectrum and core mix of lower enrichment until sufficient 2334 is bred to operate the design McF2 (th). TOCCKS, as those the same form considered for solid fuels. The necessary technology already exists for converting oxides into chlorides; the principal method to recover thorium and uranium from spent solid fuels.

3 Ay and 232 also carry over in chloride form. Continuous core reprocessing should result in: 1. Gases vented to atmosphere following suitable decay. 2. Very small long-lived FP waste, which could remain at the plant until the end of the plant life. 3. No actinide waste and possibly Ps, and D5 radiation sources. 4. Renovated core salt still highly radioactive, mixed in with the blanket product shim. Most of this radioactive, weapons-grade mix returns to the core, but some goes out as BG in a form non-conducive to intimate handling. Section 2. 5. 2 advocates minimum transport of weapons-grade and radioactive material. The one shipment of starter fuel in and shipment of BG out constitutes the only major transport.

The inventory in the reprocessing stream will depend on the reprocessing mode (batchwise vs. continuous) and on the reprocessing goals (degree of separations). The only other fuel accumulations will be in the shim tank and in the breeding gain export.

The absence of fuel fabrication and fuel element reprocessing, and associated transportation, eliminates most out-of-plant inventory. Thus, unlike other reactor fuel cycles, the national inventory of an MCFR basically comprises only the power plant inventory.

FP and 72-year-old daughter radioactivity in the molten fuel should discourage diversion prior to reprocessing. Selective reprocessing could remove just the neutron absorbers and corrosive agents, while allowing high-activity non-volatile emitters to remain.

The most sensitive (weapons-attractive) material should be the low-burnup UCL, or UCL, extracted from the blanket. Processing remotely and then mixing immediately with (reprocessed) radioactive core salt should safeguard the UCL. No stage should ever hold enough low-burnup 233 UCL to warrant seizure for a quick bomb.

But then a research reactor, compared to other neutron sources, would serve almost as well. Thus, safeguards cannot prohibit such steps; they can only seek to induce ramifications to and external signals of such modification. Signals would include higher heat production in the blanket and fewer 2,6-Neutron photons from 232 daughters.

The best opportunities for diversion or theft of core salt would occur with stockpiles and transports of breeding gain. Still, even though the fuel is packaged for safe handling in transport, the presence of 2324 daughters and radioactive fission products in the fuel will make it unattractive for handling in weapons construction. Furthermore, this radioactivity will necessitate unwieldy shielding during transport.

Fission reactors inherently induce high levels of radioactivity. A terrorist could deliberately release radioactive gases and, by means of explosive devices, radioactive aerosols. Although a USK plant continuously purges its fuel, much of the problem remains: the same amount of fission products have still been generated per mile and must eventually be disposed of (transported from in-plant safe storage to some final safe storage). Only semi-permanent storage at the MSR site can alleviate the transportation risk relative to other reactors. But even then, such a high fission product concentration might also attract saboteurs.

In contrast, a fusion reactor produces only tritium, which is conceivably dispersible. In-plant recycling further mitigates the problem. However, the only near-term economical fusion reactor is projected to be the hybrid, which will produce weapons-grade fissile.

The goals for all nuclear power plants include efficient, reliable, and safe reactor operation. This entails adequate inspection and opportunity for maintenance and repair. With MSRs, one can drain the fuel, flush the system with clean salt, and then replace the whole reactor vessel or individual heat exchanger units.

Figure 3. 1 indicates the compact layout of an MCFR and compares its overall size to that for a typical LFBR and a plant exceeds 6. 5 m in diameter. This permits prefabrication of the vessel in the shop, thus reducing construction time and cost.

MSRE demonstrated that with proper design, one can maintain an active fluid-fuel system without undue difficulty. Such design should entail easy replacement of pump and heat exchanger or in situ repair. As an example, a U-tube heat exchanger allows the major components to expand and also permits plugging any leaking tubes from the less-active coolant circuit side.

One would like to design the primary circuit to allow reduced power operation while repairing a small ox-core portion of it in a shielded cell (0. 92). Then removal of one tube circuit from operation would still leave (n-1)/n of the reactor in operation.

Because of this, the radiation fields of the core and adjacent subchannels overlap; therefore, unless robots can do the job, replacement or repair of any component (heat exchangers, pump, piping, etc. ) will probably require removal of all the radiation sources: that is, shutdown and clean out of the whole reactor.

Upon shutdown, the core fluid may drain or be pumped into safe geometry tanks. Operators could then flush the primary circuits, first with (irradiated) blanket salt, and then with fresh blanket mix. The latter might first clean up the blanket region itself. Such mix would need a separate drain tank. Both tanks and lines might require auxiliary heating. Water or steam could accomplish the final cleanup; chlorides dissolve easily in water.

Core tubes will probably require the most frequent replacement of all the solid reactor components due to the combined effects of radiation, corrosion, and high temperature. Frequency of replacement might be similar to that for LuR and LIFBR refueling (6-12 mos). Even more frequent intervals can be tolerated without significant penalty. The costs of replacement tubes will be negligible also. One would like to remove the tubes without disturbing the reactor vessel.

This flux level could appreciably activate the primary circuit environment, causing delay and difficulty in maintenance. Routing alternate subchannels through separate shielded cells outside the vessel (0. 7-1) would partly circumvent the problem; then if one subchannel broke down, the operator could divert flow to another. After a suitable decay time, the broken subcircuit could be entered and fixed.

The delayed neutron radiation stems from relatively short-lived emitters; it will quickly stop once reactor operation ceases. The high gamma radiation from fission and activation products lasts much longer; it will continue during shutdown.

Generally, the primary coolant transfers heat to an intermediate liquid coolant, which generates steam for a gas coolant that passes directly to high-efficiency gas turbines and/or process heat applications. Melting point, corrosion, and activation (by delayed neutrons) constitute the main concerns in the auxiliary plant.

Intermediate liquid coolant for a steam cycle: Liquid metals and fused salts, due to their high boiling points and thermal conductivities, enable operation at high temperatures and low pressures. This facilitates excellent heat transfer without the need for expensive and hazardous high-pressure equipment. Low pressure, in particular, allows for the utilization of thin heat exchanger tubes.

Research earlier on Na-graphite reactors and later on LMFBRs has produced a broad base of Na technology. Similar technology exists for the low-melting eutectic Na-K mixture. Either one, but especially NaK, avoids problems of coolant freezing. NASA-Lewis has also pioneered the use of K with a K-vapor turbine, achieving up to 65% efficiency. That cycle would probably need more study, though.

Unfortunately, alkali metals react vigorously with both steam and molten salt. A small leak on the high-pressure steam side could spell disaster. If the alkali leaked into the molten salt, removal by processing would be hard. Sodium would react with fuel to form.

Lead behaves better chemically as it reacts little with either salt or steam and should not enlarge any leaks. Lead costs a lot, but that has not discouraged the British from choosing it. It will require the development of suitable pumps and components, especially regarding corrosion. The inertia associated with lead's high density will also require high-strength construction.

Lead will need auxiliary heating to prevent freezing during low power and start-up conditions. The cooler parts of the lead circuit could use low alloy steels but regions above 500°C may require other materials; the superheater will need duplex tubing.

Molten salts compete favorably with liquid metals: they exhibit thermal conductivities intermediate to water and the poorer of the liquid metals. Their specific heat capacities parallel waters. Furthermore, an intermediate coolant of molten salt should more closely match the primary salt in physical properties, thereby reducing freezing and thermal stress problems. They will cost far less than liquid metals. Table 3. 10-I shows that a wide choice in eutectic melting points exists among candidate salt mixtures.

Lower turbine working pressure with gas should permit more component prefabrication. That should lower installation times and save on construction and interest charges. Avoiding the steam generator and tertiary circuit also reduces costs, the extent depending upon the gas cycle efficiency.

ORNL successfully tested single-stage centrifugal salt pumps in the MSRE and in loops at 650°C for up to 16,000 hours. Two-stage semi-axial pumps may require basic development work. Both pump designs will require development and testing to successfully increase sizes to the range needed for a 1000 MWe plant.

One solution might be to route the core tubes through a second tube or sleeve, which penetrates the reactor vessel. However, such a sleeve will itself experience high radiation damage and require replacement. It would also thermalize neutrons. Thus, we prefer to create a blanket seal on the core tube (Figure 3. 10-1). Low blanket pressure enhances the feasibility for it. One could also design a catcher for limited blanket leakage as part of the blanket reprocess.

Accumulating salt leaks from the reactor vessel. Two more tanks function as standbys and as delay tanks for salt removal for processing; one each for core and blanket. An emergency cooling system would remove the decay heat from any tank through the same lines used for preheating.

Mechanical pumps or gas pressure can transfer the salt. For initial filling, the fuel or blanket salt will be brought to the site in solid form. Electric immersion heaters or steam coils that pass below the surface of a salt bath melt the salt under inert gas in small, non-critical batches. Heating a solid bath of salt from the bottom alone can develop sufficient pressure to rupture equipment or expel the molten salt through the solid surface.

The primary salt circuits will require preheating to about 600°C; the secondary, less. In some areas, it will be more economical and convenient to heat whole spaces such as the reactor vault and processing plant; trace heating is better for longer lengths of pipework, as in secondary pipes to the steam generators. Submerged centrifugal pumps circulate the salt. They are of a type that permits no contact of the salt with the packing gland.

The MSR uniquely separates, concentrates, and stores part of its wastes within the plant for neutron economy, safety, and corrosion protection of the reactor. Being already in the form of a concentrated heat source suggests the possibility of dissipating the decay heat by putting it to work. One use could be for preheating. Helium or a low-melting point salt like Flibe (363°C) could be the heating agent. An auxiliary heater would provide a backup heat source, especially prior.

Building layout in the British MCFR (Pu) design is compact: the reactor vessel and primary circuit are small; the plant requires no elaborate fuel handling machinery. The skewed-tube configuration and tube replacement machinery here forfeit some of this compactness. If inline pyrochemical reprocessing proves practical and economical, it should fit in the building with little size increase. This includes the attendant control and maintenance areas, if feasible.

The removal of residual fission products is a crucial step in the nuclear fuel cycle. After nuclear reactions take place in a reactor, various radioactive isotopes are generated as byproducts. These fission products need to be carefully managed to ensure the safety and efficiency of the nuclear process. This process helps in reducing the overall radioactivity of the waste and enables the potential for recycling or safe disposal of the remaining materials.

If the maximum fuel salt temperatures can increase from the 900°C of the reference lead-cooled case to 920°C, the MCFR(Pu) inventory could reduce by 25%. It would then approach that for the oxide-fueled LMFBR; the doubling time would also fall to a value similar to that of the LMFBR.

LMFBRs. The fuel cycle costs above assume the well-established aqueous processing for heavy metal; an online high-temperature process only cleans the salt up. Potentially large capital savings in a high-temperature MCFR warrant further study of its plant design, maintenance problems, and safety.

Much concern with the nuclear fuel cycle centers on Pu due to its carcinogenicity and its potential use in a weapon. One desires close control lest it pollute the environment or be diverted (overtly or covertly) to weapons use. Once chemically separated (relatively easy to do for Pu), it can be put into a preassembled bomb within days. The main difficulty will be to properly implode the device. National or large subnational groups might be able to practice that trick beforehand.

Present and prospective solid fuel cycles involve extensive fuel logistics, including element fabrication, decladding, and post-operation storage. Molten salt reactors skip these steps, thereby reducing much of the pollution and diversion dangers.

A reactor on the Th fuel cycle minimizes production of Pu and heavy actinides by beginning much lower on the atomic weight scale and usefully consuming them. Fast reactors succeed even better by enhancing fission, especially for ^233U. This pertains especially to fast molten salt reactors with a very hard neutron spectrum.

All reactors use or produce weapons-grade fissile fuel. In the Th fuel cycle, the predominantly fissile fuel discloses its presence by emitting a hazardous, characteristic, highly-penetrating gamma ray. Any transformation of the reactor to the U/Pu fuel cycle will evidence a reduced gamma signal.

Extensive evaluation of core salt properties favors cheap NaCl as the carrier salt, ThCl2 for fertile material, and UCL for fissile material. High fissile salt proportion (Th/U = 0. 5, 30% NaCl) will yield high BG (up to 0. 4) and enhance actinide fission due to hard neutron spectrum. However, it also causes high doubling time and more frequent replacement of radiation-damaged core tubes.

Doubling time reduces to near 20 years at lower fissile contents (Th/U = 1 to 2; 304NaCl). The optimum composition should lie in between these two points, depending on the assignment of priorities. In earlier years of operation, one might operate with a low fissile content to achieve low DT, low flux levels, and a softer spectrum.

Fast molten chloride reactors have been cursorily considered, showing the feasibility of fuel salt circulation. The combination of that experience and MCFR research (out-of-pile experiments and theoretical studies so far) provides a basis for believing the concept will work.

Molten fuel state and cooling out-of-core simplify component design in a radiation environment. They forego complicated refueling mechanisms, close tolerances associated with solid fuel, and mechanical control devices. The molten state and low vapor pressure of the salts also offer inherent safety advantages.

Graphite and Mo alloys and coatings appear as promising candidates for primary salt containment, both in and out of the core. These high-temperature materials may permit high fuel salt temperatures (above 1000°C). This can reduce fuel salt inventory in the heat exchanger and allow gas turbine cycles and/or processes.
