The maintenance and other shutdown operations started during the last period were completed, and power operation of the MSRE was resumed in October with only one of the main radiator blowers in service. After 17 days of operation (run 8) at the maximum power attainable with one blower, the second blower was installed, and a 12-day run (run 9) was made with both blowers in service. The next run (run 10) began in December and was continued at full power for 30 days without interruption. A fourth power run (run 11) was in progress at the end of the report period with 31 days accumulated.

The performance of equipment in the primary and auxiliary systems was generally satisfactory. Detailed study has revealed no change with time in the heat-transfer coefficients of the main heat exchanger or the radiator. Salt plugs in the reactor off-gas line, from an accidental overfill of the fuel pump, caused some difficulty, but the line was finally cleared before run 10, and this problem has not recurred. Partial plugging of the particle trap and charcoal beds in the off-gas system was also encountered, but this did not restrict power operation. A new particle trap, of different design, was installed, and no further plugging was noted at that location. Only routine maintenance problems were encountered with other equipment.

The sampler-enricher was utilized to isolate thirty-six 10-g samples and eleven 50-g samples on a routine basis. Moreover, eight special samples for cover-gas analysis and five capstiles for beryllium addition to the fuel were processed. In an effort to decrease the contamination level in the sampler and adjacent areas, the interior of the sampler was cleaned with sponges, and an extra ventilation duct was positioned near the transport cask location.

Sample capsules were changed to provide a nickel-plated magnetic steel top instead of the original copper top so that a magnet can be used for retrieval in the event a capsule is dropped. A mechanical method of assuring that the maintenance valve is closed is being substituted for the existing pneumatic system, which has given difficulty because of the gradual increase in leakage of buffer gas through the upper seat. The valve itself will not be replaced at this time. Several minor maintenance tasks were performed, including replacement of the manipulator boots, inspection of the vacuum pumps, and replacement of a small hinge pin and cotter key which had worked loose inside the sampler.

A redesigned MK II off-gas filter was installed in place of the old particle trap and charcoal filter assembly. The filter was enlarged from 4 to 6 in. ID and was arranged so that the Yorkmesh entrance section can be heated above the temperature of the rest of the filter. There were other changes in the arrangement of the internals, which were made to correct deficiencies found in the first filter. Measurements showed that the pressure drop was less than 1 in. H2O at three times rated flow, and that both filters had efficiencies greater than 99.9%. Tests of the Feltmetal sections of the filter indicated that the expected life might be as little as three weeks or as great as 70 years, depending on the character of the particles in the reactor off-gas system.

The old particle trap was taken to the hot cells for testing and examination. Tests indicated an increase in the pressure drop by a factor of 20 over the clean filter, and that the Fiberfrax section was essentially clean. We concluded that most of the pressure drop was in the Yorkmesh entrance section, where material had filled in the space between the wires and plugged the opening of the inlet pipe. Since the inlet pipe expanded longitudinally due to fission product decay heat, it is believed that operation at power caused the inlet pipe to push into the plugging material, thereby increasing the resistance to flow in the manner of a thermal valve. Metallographic examination of the deposit area of the Yorkmesh showed heavy carburization of the wire, and there were indications that the wire had been heated to at least 1200°F. The deposit itself contained much carbonaceous material, as well as high Ba and St fractions. There was very little Be or Zr, indicating that there was essentially no salt carried to this point, and most of the fission products found were daughter products of Xe and Kr.

The restriction in the annulus between the pump shaft and shield plug in the MK-1 prototype pump, which was discussed in the previous semiannual report, was found to have been caused by the salt level being raised accidentally into the annulus during a fill of the system.

The MK-1 fuel pump tank was removed from the prototype pump facility and installed on a test stand. This stand was constructed for room-temperature measurement of the stresses produced in the weld attachment of the discharge nozzle by forces and moments imposed by the pump-tank discharge piping. The crack was repaired by welding, and further exploratory tests are being made to measure the stresses.

The spare rotary element for the MSRE fuel pump was prepared for reactor service and is being held in standby. The lubrication pump endurance test was continued. Shaft deflection and critical speed tests were conducted.

Neutron energy spectra in the MSRE were calculated and used to estimate important isotopic initial SLi in the salt and °B in the graphite, and production of tritium and °O as products of neutron reactions. With the exception of 235I, the principal contributors to long-term reactivity.

Changes were found to be the Li burnout and Pu production. Further studies were made in the correlation of the observed time behavior of the 135Ye poisoning in the MSRE with calculations from a theoretical model. Graphic comparisons are given of calculated buildup and removal of 15Xe reactivity, following changes in power level, with some of the experimental reactivity transients observed from operation to date. The results, in good accord with previously reported evidence, point to the conclusion that a small amount of undissolved helium gas is in circulation with the salt, which enhances the mass transfer and removal of xenon from the reactor. In addition, the transient analysis supports the assumption of a fairly high efficiency of removal of xenon directly from the gas bubbles by the external.

There was no microscopically visible corrosion or coatings on the Hastelloy N reactor vessel wall surveillance specimens exposed to molten fluoride fuel in the core during a 7800-MWh operation in which the specimens accumulated a thermal neutron dose of approximately 1. 3 x 10^20 nve. However, a carbide deposit about 0. 001 in.

A loss in ductility of the irradiated specimens was found at elevated temperatures, as expected. In addition, however, there was an unexpected 20% reduction in ductility at low temperature, which is thought to be related to extensive grain-boundary carbide precipitation. The doses received by the metal specimens are higher than the reactor vessel is anticipated to receive over its lifetime, and the test results give reassurance that the mechanical properties of Hastelloy N are more than adequate for the service planned.

A family of curves was obtained from tests of Hastelloy N at various strain rates and temperatures. These curves will allow one to predict the strain rate sensitivity of the ductility of Hastelloy N at any given temperature. The strain rate sensitivity changes markedly with temperature.

The search is continuing for corrosion-resistant alloys that are suitable for brazing graphite to Hastelloy N. A furnace for brazing large graphite-to-Hastelloy-N assemblies is being constructed. The long-term thermal convection loops of Hastelloy N and type 304L stainless steel have continued to circulate fused salts, acquiring 43,024 and 31,749 hr respectively. Weight losses from specimens inserted in the stainless steel loop are less than what was measured earlier.

Chemical analyses of the uranium concentration in the fuel salt show a measurable decrease. This results from dilution of the fuel salt by the remnants of flush salt that remain in the reactor after flushing and from the transfer of about 7 kg of uranium from the fuel to the flush salt in each drain-flush-fill sequence.

To enhance the oxidizing effect and make the fuel more reducing in character, the fuel was treated with beryllium metal to reduce a small amount of UF6 to UF4. To date, 27.94 g of beryllium has been introduced; this has converted 0. 65% of the UF6 to UF3.

Most fission products behaved as expected, with the exception of rather noble metals, which continued to show an apparent tendency to volatilize and to plate on metal surfaces. Attempts to decrease the volatilization by chemical reduction of the fuel with elemental beryllium were unsuccessful. Detectable volatilization apparently continued for long periods after shutdown.

In connection with a study of methods of reprocessing MSBR fuel, the solubility of SmF and NdF in the fuel solvent has been measured as a function of temperature. Salt compositions for possible use as a blanket for the MSBR have been reviewed.

In addition to the regular salt samples, several special samples were analyzed. These included capsules used to make beryllium additions to the fuel salt, MSRE off-gas samples, and highly purified LiF, BeF2 samples. The absolute standard deviation for oxide determined in ten radioactive fuel samples taken from the MSRE over an eight-month period was 8 ppm.

A transpiration method has been developed for the determination of U5/U ratios in radioactive fuel samples. The method is based on the measurement of the HF produced by the reduction of oxidized species when the molten fuel is sparged with hydrogen. Increases in the U/U4 ratio from about 0.0005 to 0.005 were observed when metallic beryllium was added to the fuel in reversibility. On the basis of limited stability tests, this electrode appears to be suitable.

Reference for electrochemical measurements in molten fluorides. An anodic oxidation wave resulting from the voltametric oxidation of U at +1.4 V was studied and found to have properties most consistent with oxidation of U to U5, followed by catalytic disproportionation of the US. The spectrophotometric determination of U in molten fluoride salts was investigated by a new technique in which U5 is generated voltametrically in the optical path of a captive-liquid cell. The feasibility of determining 50 ppm of U in the presence of 2% U was demonstrated. Measurements of the absorption spectra of Er, Sm, and Ho in LiF-BeF2 indicated that these ions would not interfere with the determination of U.

Irradiation of the first molten-salt thermal convection loop experiment in the Oak Ridge Research Reactor was terminated on August 8, 1966 because of a leak through a broken transfer line. A power density of 105 W/cm was achieved in the fuel channels of the graphite core before the failure of the loop. A second loop, modified to eliminate causes of failure encountered in the first, began long-term irradiation in January 1967. An average core power density of 160 W per cubic centimeter of fuel salt was attained and maintained in the first ORR irradiation cycle.

Breeder reactor design studies have been concerned primarily with making a choice of the basic reactor on which design effort will be concentrated. The modular concept has been chosen, and the power for which the module is to be used is set for the moment at 556 MW (thermal). The average core power density, and therefore the flux, has been arbitrarily cut from the 80 kW/liter used in previous studies to 39 kW/liter to give greater core life expectancy.

The fuel heat exchanger and the blanket heat exchanger are flanged into place, reducing the number of pipes to be remotely cut and welded if replacement of these items is necessary. A concentric coolant line connects the primary and blanket coolant circuits. Flow sheets and design criteria are being developed for the gas sparging system and the off-gas system.

Some of the more basic MSBR nuclear calculations have been started, and from the first results, some changes have been made in the unit cell dimensions of the core. The reactor as now contemplated has a yield of approximately 6% per year, a breeding ratio of 1.07, and a fuel cycle cost of 0.43 mill/kWh on an 80% plant factor.

Work on reactor physics included a series of cell calculations performed to examine the sensitivity of the MSBR cross sections and reactivity to various changes in cell structure. Cell calculations indicated a reactivity advantage associated with increasing cell diameter, and a nominal diameter (flat to flat) of 5 inches was selected. Detailed radial and axial flux distributions were obtained from the two-dimensional calculations. The radial and axial peak-to-average flux ratios were also analyzed.

The central cell of the reactor was examined for reactivity control purposes. If a completely empty graphite tube of 5 in. OD and 4 in. ID is filled with fertile salt, the change in reactivity is Δk = -0.018%. If the empty tube is filled with graphite, the reactivity change is Δk = +0. 0012%. Thus, there appears to be a substantial amount of reactivity control available by varying the height of the fertile column in the tube.

Molten-Salt Reactor Processing Studies have matured in the last year. Studies on continuous fluorination techniques have ascertained that high recoveries and good fluorine utilization are feasible, and the measurements of relative volatilities for the distillation step have been highly encouraging. Further analysis of the operations has revealed no new problems which could thwart this approach.

Continuous Fluorination of a Molten Salt. The recovery of uranium from the fuel salt of an MSBR by continuous fluorination embraces two significant problems: (1) the establishment of an adequate concentration gradient in the tower to effect both high recovery and reasonable fluorine utilization and (2) the operation of the system with a frozen layer of salt on all surfaces to protect them from oxidation by fluorine. Studies with non-protected systems using 1-inch-diameter towers have demonstrated steady-state recoveries up to 99. 9% of the uranium with fluorine utilization of 15%. Studies on column protection involve the construction of a 5-inch-diameter nickel tower with provision to generate heat fluxes to create a frozen wall of salt.

Molten-Salt Distillation Studies. Relative volatilities measured at 1000°C and 0.5 mm Hg are 1074 and 2x 107, respectively. Data have been acquired on the rate of vaporization as a function of system pressure, which show that the processing rates necessary in an MSBR system can be achieved in stills of reasonable size. However, analysis of the buildup of non-volatile salts at the vaporizing surface indicates that some method of salt circulation is mandatory.

About 48 liters of MSRE fuel salt will be processed by vacuum distillation after the 55U has been removed by fluorination. The equipment, which has been designed and is being fabricated, will be used in an experimental program with nonradioactive salt to study still performance before.

Our major goal now is to achieve a thermal breeder reactor that will produce power at low cost while simultaneously conserving and extending the nation's fuel resources. Fuel for this type of reactor would be 238UF or 235UF dissolved in a salt of composition near 2LiF-BeF2. The blanket would be ThF4 dissolved in a carrier of similar composition. The technology being developed for the breeder is also applicable to advanced converter reactors.

Our major effort at present is being applied to the operation and testing of the Molten-Salt Reactor Experiment. This reactor was built to test the types of fuels and materials that would be used in thermal breeder and converter reactors and to provide several years of experience with the operation and maintenance of a small molten-salt reactor. The experiment is demonstrating on a small scale the attractive features and the technical feasibility of these systems for large civilian power reactors. The MSRE operates at 1200°F and at atmospheric pressure, with 29. 1 mol % BeF2 and 65 mol % LiF, and the uranium is about 30% U-235. The melting point is 840°F. In later operation, we expect to use highly enriched uranium in the lower concentration typical of the fuel for a breeder. The composition of the solvent can be adjusted in each case to retain about the same liquidus temperature.

The fuel circulates through a reactor vessel, an external pump, and a heat exchange system. All this equipment is constructed of Hastelloy N, a nickel-molybdenum-chromium alloy with exceptional resistance to corrosion by molten fluorides and with high strength at high temperatures. The reactor core contains an assembly of graphite moderator bars that are in direct contact with the fuel. The graphite is a new material of high density and small pore size.

Heat produced in the reactor is transferred to a coolant salt in the heat exchanger, and the coolant salt is pumped through a radiator to dissipate the heat to the atmosphere. A small facility installed in the MSRE building will be used for processing the fuel by treatment with gaseous.

Design of the MSRE was begun early in the summer of 1960. Orders for special materials were placed in the spring of 1961. Major modifications to Building 7503 at ORNL, in which the reactor is installed, were started in the fall of 1961 and were completed by January 1963.

Fabrication of the reactor equipment was begun early in 1962. Some difficulties were experienced in obtaining materials and in making and installing the equipment, but the essential installations were completed so that prenuclear testing could begin in August of 1964. The prenuclear testing was completed with only minor difficulties in March of 1965. Some modifications were made before beginning the critical experiments in May, and the reactor was first critical on June 1.

Operation at a power of 1 MW was begun in January 1966. At that power level, trouble was experienced with plugging of small ports in the control valves in the off-gas system by heavy liquid and varnish-like organic materials. These materials are believed to be produced from a very small amount of oil that leaks through a gasketed seal and into the salt in the tank of the fuel circulating pump. The oil vaporizes and accompanies the gaseous fission products and helium cover gas purge into the off-gas system. There the intense beta radiation from the krypton and xenon polymerizes some of the hydrocarbons, and the products plug small openings. This difficulty was largely overcome by installing a specially designed filter in the off-gas line.

Operated until the middle of July to the equivalent of about one month at full power when one of the radiator-cooling blowers — which were left over from the ANP program — broke from mechanical stress. While new blowers were being procured, an array of graphite and metal surveillance specimens was taken from the core and examined.

Power operation was resumed in October with one blower. Then, in November, the second blower was installed, and full power was again attained. After a shutdown to remove salt that had accidentally gotten into an off-gas line, the MSRE was operated in December and January at full power for 30 days without interruption. A fourth power run was begun late in January and was still in progress after 31 days at the end of this report period.

In most respects, the reactor has performed very well: the fuel has been completely stable, the fuel and coolant salts have not corroded the Hastelloy N container material, and there has been no detectable reaction between the fuel salt and the graphite in the core of the reactor. Mechanical difficulties with equipment have been largely confined to peripheral systems and auxiliaries. Except for the small leakage of oil into the pump bowl, the salt pumps have run flawlessly for over 10,000 hrs.

Because the MSRE is of a new and advanced type, substantial research and development effort is provided in support of the operation. Included are engineering development and testing of reactor components and systems, metallurgical development of materials, and studies of the chemistry of the salts and their compatibility with graphite and metals, both in-pile and out-of-pile.

Conceptual design studies and evaluations are being made of large power breeder reactors that use the molten-salt technology. Some research and development are being directed specifically to the requirements of two-region breeders, including work on materials, on the chemistry of fuel and blanket salts, and on processing methods.

The reactor shutdown that started in July continued through September. The first of the two specially constructed replacement blowers was delivered on September 28, ten weeks after the reactor was shut down. Meanwhile, the time was fully occupied with a host of other jobs that were completed about the time the replacement blower was received. These included removing and replacing core samples, work on control-rod drives, replacement of the special fuel off-gas filter, modification of the radiator door seals, and repairs and modifications in the cooling-water system. The first step in the reactor startup in run 8 was seven days of flush-salt circulation (see Fig. ). After the temporary heaters for this job were removed, the reactor cell was sealed, and the leakage table by a test at 10 psig. By this time, the first blower was ready to run.

The reactor was shut down to install the second blower unit, which had just been delivered, and to attempt to relieve the plugged line at the pump bowl. The system was flushed, the reactor cell was opened, and heat was applied to the line. While the line was hot, pressure was applied, and the line opened up. Tests showed that, within the accuracy of the available instrumentation, the pressure drop was then normal. The heaters were removed, the cell was sealed, and nuclear operation was resumed seven days after the fuel was drained for the shutdown. Also during this time, a gas flow element in the vent from the oil catch tank was removed, and an alternative flow measurement provided. The flow element had become plugged when, as the last step in the fuel drain, the overflow tank was emptied, and gas from the pump bowl again vented out through the oil drain line.

When the power was raised on November 7 for run 9, the temperature of the off-gas line showed that it was already plugged, and the gas was again bypassing through the overflow tank. To prevent the transfer of activity into the oil drain line when salt was recovered from the overflow tank, the nuclear power was reduced several hours before each transfer. Limitations on the amount of salt that can be tolerated in the overflow tank and the heel that remains after a recovery required that the power be reduced for a transfer every two days after the initial heel had accumulated. Nuclear operation was continued in this fashion for 12 days while heaters, tools, and procedures for more positively clearing the off-gas line were devised.

Search for the restriction in the off-gas line revealed thin plugs in the flanges at both ends of a removable section near the pump bowl. The plugs were easily poked out, and the line was then shown to be clear by viewing, probing, and pressure-drop measurements. The plugs were attributed.

The high inleakage into the reactor cell proved to be from valve operator pneumatic lines. Since these lines are protected by automatic block valves, the leaks did not violate containment. Therefore, flowmeters were installed so their input could be taken into account in the routine monitoring of cell leak rate during operation.

During the first two weeks of the run, the pressure drop across the particle trap in the fuel off-gas line repeatedly built up and had to be relieved by forward- or back-blowing with helium. Examination of the first particle trap, removed in August, had shown that heating the central inlet tube would tend to jam it into the first-stage filtering medium. To test the effect of reducing the heating, for the last two weeks of run 10, the off-gas was delayed on its way to the particle trap by routing it through the two empty drain tanks. When this route was followed, the particle trap pressure drop came down and stayed down.

Of beryllium metal through the sampler-enricher. One purpose of increasing the reducing power of the salt was to investigate the effects on volatile fission product compounds (see p. 123). Another was to alleviate concern over possible corrosion. Practically no corrosion had been seen (<0. 1 mil of generalized corrosion in 20 months), but the absence of corrosion depends on maintaining a reducing environment, and a larger margin was desired.

Operation at full power was to be interrupted after 30 days to permit inspection of the new blower hubs and blades, which had by then been run over 1000 hours. But toward the end of the run, two conditions developed which caused us to drain the reactor and extend the shutdown. The heat.

Nuclear operation was resumed in run 11 on January 28 and continued without interruption (except for 2 hours to investigate a false temperature alarm) through the end of the report period, February 28. No difficulties of any consequence were encountered, and the program of adjusting the fuel UF3 concentration and observing the effect on volatile fission products continued.

Details of operations and maintenance during this report period are given in the sections that follow. Although the emphasis tends to be on the troubles, the reactor was in operation most of the time, and the operation was, in most respects, quite satisfactory. Table 1. 1 summarizes some of the history. Salt was circulated in the fuel and coolant loops for 60% and 82%, respectively, of the time in this report period. The reactor was critical 53% of the time.

The purpose of the reactivity-balance calculation during power operation of the reactor is to provide current information about the nuclear condition of the system. During this report period, improvements were made in the calculations, making it possible to detect very small anomalies in reactivity behavior; none was observed. Calculations made during previous periods of operation did not include the 135Xe poisoning term because the mathematical model, with the coefficients then available, did not adequately reflect the xenon behavior in the reactor. When power operation was resumed in October 1966 (run 8), we included a calculation of the xenon effect to provide a complete reactivity balance. Subsequently, the overall calculation was improved by modifying some xenon stripping parameters to improve the description of the xenon transients and by including long-term isotopic change effects that had been previously neglected.

Figure 1.2 shows the results of some of the online reactivity balances calculated in runs 8, 9, and 10. During runs 8 and 9, the parameters used to calculate the xenon poisoning were found to describe the steady-state condition reasonably well, but the transients were not well described. This difference between the calculated and actual xenon transients produced the cyclic variation in the residual reactivity in November when the nuclear power was cycled between 0 and 7.2 MW. 

Pump spray ting. The negative activity was produced by the transport of additional 135Xe into the graphite moderator. Since the removal of xenon from the graphite is a slower process than bubble stripping, the recovery in this transient was slower than in the other cases.

Operation at power was resumed on January 28, 1966, and has continued without major interruption through the end of this report period. After the initial buildup of I3°Xe poisoning, the residual reactivity has been between 0 and +0. 04% dk/k, except for one incident in which excess circulating voids were introduced by abnormal operation (low salt level in the pump tank).

The long-term drift in the reactivity balance is summarized in Figure 3, which shows the residual reactivity as a function of integrated power from the start of power operation through run 10 (ending January 15, 1967). The reference condition for this figure is the system condition at the start of run 4 (December 20, 1965). Because of the remaining small uncertainty in the 15Xe term, the representative results shown here are taken at zero power with no xenon present. There appears to have been a positive shift of about 0.05% Δk/k during the first 1000 MWhr of operation that has remained relatively constant since that time. No specific cause has yet been established for this shift. However, the change is nearly as small as the estimated confidence limits of the calculation (±0. 04% Δk/k) and is much smaller than the operating limit on the reactivity anomaly, which is 40.5% Δk/k.

Previous reports of the reactivity behavior suggested the possibility of a significantly larger positive reactivity anomaly. However, those tentative conclusions were based on data from early results which have since been corrected. The earlier balances did not include the reactivity effects of isotopic changes (other than U-235) or of flush-salt dilutions. Correction for these effects made a net reduction in the magnitude of the apparent anomaly. (The calculation of the isotopic change effects is described on p. 83 of this report. ) In addition, preliminary analysis of some pressure-release experiments indicated a circulating void fraction of 1 to 2% by volume in the fuel salt. If such a void fraction had been present at steady state, the negative effect of the voids would have required an anomalous positive reactivity effect of 0. 1 to 0. 2% dk/k in order to produce the net results that were observed.

We have concluded, after intensive analysis of the data, that the pressure-release experiments do not permit explicit evaluation of the steady-state circulating void fraction. In the preliminary analysis of these experiments, the level rise in the pump tank and the reactivity loss associated with a pressure release were attributed entirely to circulating voids, and a void fraction of 1 to 2 vol% was required to account for the observed effects. However, the excess voids in circulation immediately after the pressure release disappeared from the system very rapidly (indicated bubble stripping efficiencies for the spray ring in the pump tank were 50 to 100%), and this was inconsistent with a large steady-state void fraction. In addition, the reactivity loss due to 1 or 2 vol% voids (0.2 to 0.4% Sk/k) that should have been observed upon starting circulation was apparently.

The existence of circulating voids immediately after a rapid decrease in pressure does not require the presence of a comparable circulating void fraction prior to the decrease; it requires only a source of gas inside the body of the liquid. This source could be a fixed void that is inaccessible to the salt so that its volume is essentially independent of the system overpressure. (One possibility might be the pores in the graphite and the spaces between the graphite stringers in the core. ) The inventory of gas in such a void would increase with increasing overpressure, and when the pressure is released, this excess inventory would go into circulation with the salt. The pressure-release experiments give only an upper limit of 1 to 2% for the circulating void fraction if circulation of all the voids is assumed.

At the start of run 8 in October 1966, a test was performed to evaluate the reactivity loss associated with the buildup of the steady-state circulating void fraction. Prior to this start-up, the fuel salt had been in a drain tank for 11 weeks and should have been free of bubbles.

The cooling air to the pump tank was turned off during the attempts to melt out the salt plug in the 522 line, and although the temperatures on the pump tank surface were higher than with the cooling air, the temperature gradient was less. Since this temperature distribution is satisfactory and may actually be better than with the air cooling, the use of air cooling was discontinued during run 9. Fuel pump cooling air had been used during all power operation of the reactor prior to run 8, and no comparison with previous data is possible.

The thermocouple response when the air was turned off was checked to see if there was any indication that the thermocouple attachments had loosened. The transient data indicated that the largest temperature error, caused by airflow over the thermocouple, was of the order of 20 to 40°F. Although a direct comparison is not possible, these results appear to be consistent with previous data. The most probable explanation for the decrease in temperatures is either.

Reactor Vessel. Certain temperatures on the reactor vessel are monitored continuously to determine the effects of radiation heating and to determine if there is any indication of sedimentation buildup in the vessel. The temperature differences between the reactor inlet and the lower head and between the inlet and the core-support lugs are monitored by the computer. 2 Mw, which could easily be the result of temperature measurement errors. The past and future data will be examined more closely to determine if a trend in the temperature differences does exist.

The cycles shown, the Fill/Drain, "Heat/Cool," and Power cycles, are the most important, in that order. The Fill/Drain cycle consists of filling the system at 1200°F, starting circulation, and then draining the system. The Heat/Cool cycle involves heating the empty system from room temperature to 1200°F and then cooling the empty system back to room temperature.

Some of the reactor operations do not fall clearly into single cycles of the types shown; partial power cycles and overall system temperature changes are examples. These effects are accumulated and characterized as equivalent power cycles, which is why there are more power cycles in the fuel system than in the coolant system. Approximately 54% of the design cycles have been used.

Predicted behavior. Subsequent frequency response tests were made at the start of run 11 with the reactor at three different power levels in order to detect any changes in reactor dynamic behavior resulting from a year of power operation (16,750 MWh). Pseudorandom binary reactivity insertions were used in tests at power levels of 1, 5, and 7 MW.

Two problems encountered in the analysis of the first series of tests were offsets or biases in the magnitude ratio curves for tests run at a given power level and some unexpected low-frequency periodic inputs that showed up as spikes in the autocorrelation functions of the rod motion input signal. Neither of these problems recurred in the latest tests. The appearance and disappearance of these anomalies are as yet unexplained.

Primary Heat Exchanger. The evaluation of the effects of prolonged operation on the heat transfer in the salt-to-salt heat exchanger was continued. Heat transfer data at six different time periods were evaluated using the derivative method, with the results shown in Fig. 5. Although the calculated coefficients show a slight downward trend with time, we believe the apparent trend in heat transfer is within the uncertainty band of the calculations. A lower value of this ratio indicates poorer heat transfer since the fuel and coolant flow rates are.

Radiator. The reactor was operated at various power levels at the beginning of run 11, and data were taken to evaluate the heat removal at different radiator settings. The heat removal capability of the radiator as a function of the radiator setting is shown in Fig. 6.

Open by changing the bypass damper position. A direct measure of the radiator-air outlet temperature can be made only when the bypass is fully closed; even then, the air from the annulus blowers would cause an error in the measured temperature rise across the radiator. The outlet air temperatures for the other conditions were calculated from air and salt heat balances around the radiator. Corrections were applied for the effects of the annulus blowers. However, the measured temperature rise of the air across the radiator tubes was about 17% higher than the calculated rise in the two cases where the bypass damper was closed, and a measurement was possible. This discrepancy indicates that either the airflow measurement, the temperature measurement, or the reactor heat balance is incorrect.

The air heat balance and the salt heat balance reported previously seem to indicate that the discrepancies are the result of some specific error in measurement rather than random variations in the data. The radiator air instrumentation was not intended to be accurate enough to permit a precise heat balance on the air. The stack is not sufficiently long to ensure either a uniform velocity distribution or a uniform temperature distribution across the stack cross-section. Since the velocity and temperature are measured only at a single point in the stack, any flow or temperature asymmetry could cause a significant error. There is also the possibility that the initial calibration of the air flow instrument was incorrect.

Stress rupture life of the reactor system. The minimum coolant salt temperature in normal operation has been set at 1000°F in order to reduce the probability of freezing the radiator in case salt flow is interrupted. These two temperature limitations and the heat transfer capability of the main heat exchanger limit the reactor power to about 7.4 MW. In the summer months, this power limitation coincides with the capacity of the coolant radiator. However, during colder weather, the radiator heat transfer capacity increases, and a portion of the cooling air must be bypassed to avoid overcooling the coolant salt.

The reactor power can be increased only by improving the heat transfer performance of both the radiator and the main heat exchanger. Increasing the temperature difference between the fuel and coolant system is undesirable because of adverse effects on the thermal cycle and stress-rupture life of the reactor system.

The study was completed to determine the maximum flow rates that could be obtained and to determine the increase in heat transfer performance resulting from these flow increases. The pumps are capable of accepting larger-diameter impellers and of operating at a higher horsepower rating so that increased flow is possible. The flow can also be increased by using a higher-frequency power supply to increase the rotational speed of the pumps. Slightly higher flow rates can be obtained with the higher rotating speed because the horsepower rating of the drive motors can be increased at the higher speed. Calculations indicate that the maximum possible flow rates for the fuel and coolant systems would be 1530 and 1044 gpm, respectively, assuming that the pumps themselves are the limiting factor. Using these maximum flow rates and operating between the temperature limits that now permit 7. 2 Mw, the heat transfer capability of the heat exchanger would be increased to 8. 1 Mw. Even this modest increase might not be practical; however, because of undesirable effects of increasing the flow. This would be undesirable because it would introduce more uncertainty into the reactivity balance.

In the radiator, increasing the salt flow has very little effect since over 95% of the heat transfer resistance is on the air side of the tubes. There is no way to improve the radiator performance without major expense. Additional surface area could be provided by adding more tubes or by adding some type of fins to the tubes, but either would be difficult and time-consuming. Additional air capacity could be provided, but this too would be a major undertaking. The radiator has 2900 hp as compared with 500 hp for the present blowers. One additional blower could possibly increase the radiator heat removal to the 8. 1-MW level, which would be consistent with the maximum possible power of the heat exchanger. However, the blowers would be operating very close to their surge limit, new drive motors might be required to avoid an overload condition, and the existing building electrical system would be unable to supply the third blower. In conclusion, the difficulties in raising the power capability of the reactor far outweigh any advantages that could be gained from the relatively small power increase that can be reasonably achieved. Since the objectives of the MSRE can be met with the present heat removal system, no attempts to increase the power capability are planned.

The rebuilt units have reinforced hubs and have magnesium alloy blades that are 35% lighter than the original aluminum ones. The new units were also given a 30% overspeed test, with a dye-penetrant inspection of the hubs and blading before and after the test. Rotor assemblies were rejected on three occasions because of cracking in the blades after the overspeed test. In each of these cases, cracking had been present prior to the test, but it had been removed by surface grinding. The units that were accepted, including a spare unit, were free of objectionable defects.

The rebuilt rotor assemblies were installed in MB-1 and MB-3 under the supervision of the manufacturer's service engineer. The rotor and drive-motor shafts were carefully aligned, and the rotors were dynamically balanced in place. Instrumentation was provided to monitor the vibrations and the bearing temperatures of the two blowers while they are in operation. Vibration normally runs below 1 mil, although greater vibrations developed on two occasions, once when ice built up on the blades of MB-1 and once when its bearings became very cold.

The modifications of the door seals proved effective in reducing air leakage and consequent heat losses to a satisfactory minimum. Although close examination was not possible after the radiator went into operation, external examination on January 17 showed little deterioration in more than 3400 hours at high temperature. The inlet door was in excellent condition, with good contact at the top and bottom between the linked hard seals and the soft seal on the face of the enclosure.

On the outlet door, the hard seals appeared to be in good condition. There was a tight seal across the top, but a gap of 1% to 1.5% in across the bottom of the door. A 1-ft section of the soft seal that had become detached was found in the outlet duct.

As a result of the blower failure in July 1966, some anti-missile protection was provided between the blowers and the radiator. A grid of 1-inch stainless steel aircraft cables, shock-mounted, on 2-inch centers, was installed just downstream of the blowers.

The fuel off-gas system continued to present some problems throughout the period. One problem area was associated with the overfill of the fuel pump that got flushed salt in some gas lines near the pump. The other was a continuation of the difficulty that appeared when the reactor first operated at power: the accumulation of polymerized oil residues in small passages. The former interfered with operations and required considerable work in the reactor cell to remedy. The latter was a nuisance through run 10, but after the installation of a new particle trap, it caused no more.

Plugging near Fuel Pump. After the accidental overfill of the fuel pump, the bubbler reference line was cleared by remotely applied external heaters. Salt in the sampler line was melted the same way but ran down and froze at the junction with the pump bowl. The obstruction that formed here cleared out when the pump was heated up with salt in the bowl. No further trouble.

Although some salt entered the off-gas line, as indicated by a temporary rise in temperature at TE-522-2, pressure drop measurements showed no significant difference from the clean condition. This was attributed to the blast of compressed helium from the drain tank that was released backward through the off-gas line before the salt had time to freeze completely when the overfill triggered an automatic drain. Therefore, the only action taken before the startup in September was to replace the short, flexible jumper section of the line where the convolutions would certainly hold some salt.

The off-gas flowed freely, with no unusual pressure drop through 26 days of circulating helium, flush salt, and fuel salt at low power. Then, two days after power operation was resumed at 5. 8 MW, a plug developed in line 522 somewhere between the pump bowl and the junction of the overflow tank vent with the 4-in. holdup line. The first indication was a decrease over a few hours from 225°F to 160°F at TE-522-2, as the plug caused the off-gas to bypass through the holdup tank. The presence of the plug was confirmed when HCV-523 was closed to build up pressure to return salt from the overflow tank to the pump bowl; pressure in the pump bowl also built up.

The bypassing of the off-gas through the overflow tank did not hinder operation, except for one specific job: recovery of salt from the overflow tank. Salt slowly but continuously accumulates in the tank during operation, and it is therefore essential to return salt to the pump bowl two or three times a week in order to maintain proper levels. With the plug in the line from the pump bowl, it was necessary to greatly reduce helium flows into the pump so that the overflow tank pressure could be increased faster than that in the pump bowl to make the salt transfer. This was a consequence of the reduced helium purge down the shaft annulus and the unavoidable, sudden pressurization of the pump bowl that occurred at times in the procedure. The charcoal trap in the vent from the oil catch tank prevented any serious release of activity to the stack. The activity level in the oil tank and the line increased; however, and the last two releases from the pump bowl caused the flow element in the vent to plug partially.

After run 8 was terminated, steps were taken to clear the plug from the off-gas line so that the normal salt recovery procedure could be used. Frozen salt was suspected of causing the plug, so the fuel loop was flushed to reduce radiation levels; the reactor cell was opened, and specially built electrical heaters were applied to the line between the pump bowl and the first flange. Heating alone did not clear the plug, but when, with the line hot, 10 psi was applied backward across the plug, it blew through. The pressure drop came down as more helium was blown through until it became indistinguishable from the normal drop in a clean pipe. The temporary heating.

In run 9, the power was raised only 8 hours after fuel circulation had commenced, but TE-522-2 came up to only 150°F, indicating that the line was already plugged again. Plans were immediately set in motion to do a more thorough job of clearing. While tools and procedures were being devised, the reactor was kept in operation, but great care was taken to avoid getting fission products or salt spray up the pump shaft annulus again. This entailed lowering the power to 10 kW, 24 hours before the overflow tank was to be emptied, then stopping the pump 4 hours beforehand to let the salt mist settle. Then the fuel pump was vented through the sampler and the auxiliary charcoal bed during the transfer. After three cycles of this, the reactor was drained and flushed again in preparation for working on the off-gas line.

This time, heat was applied to the short section of line between the second flange and the top of the 4-inch decay pipe. When heating to about 1100°F did not open the line, the flexible jumper was disconnected to permit clearing the obstruction mechanically. In the flange above the 4-inch.

7-inch bore was completely blocked, but the weight of a chisel tool broke through what appeared to be only a thin crust of salt. Borescope inspection showed that the rest of the vertical line was practically clean, and there was only a thin layer of salt in the bottom of the horizontal run of the 4-inch pipe. Helium was blown through the line at five times the normal flow, and the pressure drop indicated no restriction. Turning then toward the pump bowl, we saw a similar plug inserted all the way into the pump bowl to prove that a good-sized passage existed. A new jumper line was installed, and operation was resumed. No further difficulty was encountered with this section of the off-gas system.

Because obtaining samples remotely without spreading contamination would have been most difficult, no analyses were made of the material in the flanges. But it appeared that salt had frozen in the line, almost completely blocking it during the overfill. Material in the off-gas stream during operation then plugged the small passages. The heaters melted the salt out of the pipe, but the flanges were not as hot, and a thin bridge remained.

Particle Trap. The first particle trap was designed on the basis of a rather brief period of investigation and development after plugging in the off-gas system halted the planned approach to full power. It served its purpose in that it protected the pressure control valve and, to some extent.

Effected only temporary relief at best. Various tactics were used to get gas to the particle trap with as little delay as possible, to see if increasing the fission product heating would drive off organic material from the place where it was causing plugging. After these efforts proved ineffectual, the opposite approach was used: the off-gas was delayed as long as possible. This was done in recognition that heating caused the central inlet tube to expand farther into the Yorkmesh filtering material. The delay was obtained by routing the gas through an equalizing line to the empty drain tank, through the tank and the salt fill lines to the other tank where it bubbled up through several inches of salt heel, then out through the drain-tank vent line to the particle trap. This gave the gas about 8 hr of delay and also bubbled it through salt in the freeze valves and drain tank before it reached the particle trap. The pressure drop across the trap was 16 psi when the gas was rerouted, but within a few hours, it was below 2 psi. For the last two weeks of run 10, the pressure drop across the particle trap remained below 2 psi when the delayed route was followed, but began to build up almost immediately when the original route was used.

The charcoal filter, just after the particle trap, held up fission products as shown by the heating during power operation, but the temperature profile showed no significant change to indicate poisoning by organics. The pressure control valve was operated full open with the pump bowl pressure determined by the drop in other parts of the system. Therefore, it appeared that nothing would be lost by removing these items to make room for new dual-particle traps.

The new (third) particle trap had been in service for 5100 MWh of reactor operation by the end of the report period. The measured pressure drop showed no increase at all, remaining below 0.1 psi. At 7.4 MW, the temperature measured near the Yorkmesh was around 275°F; the thermocouple nearest the Feltmetal (but shielded by a pipe and a bellows) averaged 108°F, and the lowest couple indicated 61°F, only 10°F above the temperature of the water surrounding the trap (see p. 42 for a description of the new traps).

Main Charcoal Beds: The main charcoal beds continued to perform their function of holding up the fission products; there was no breakthrough of activity other than the normal 10-year 5Kr. Some difficulty was encountered at times, however, when the pressure drop at the inlet built up to an inconvenient level.

Bed sections 1A and 1B had been used almost exclusively during earlier runs, and they were online when run 8 started. As had happened before, the pressure drop at the inlet of these sections began to increase a few hours after the power was raised. When the pressure drop reached 7 psi, sections 2A and 2B were also brought online. The pressure drop through the four sections in parallel remained below 1 psi through the end of the run, but the pressure drop through 1A and 1B remained high, and backblowing did not bring their pressure drop below 4 psi.

A situation similar to that in 1A and 1B also existed in the auxiliary charcoal bed, where the pressure drop was abnormally high and did not respond to backblowing. Tests showed that the restriction was near the inlet end, and it was strongly suspected that it was due to organic material clogging the steel wool at the opening of the inlet pipe into the bed.

Between runs 8 and 9, it was tried. Some improvement was observed when the heater temperatures reached 720°F, and after these temperatures were raised to 1235°F and then cooled, the pressure drop was down by a factor of 5 to a satisfactory level.

In light of this success, an attempt was made to clear up the restriction in section 1B by heating the inlet with a torch. (Electric heaters to fit this bed were not then available. ) Although the temperature in the bed reached 870°F, there was no improvement in pressure drop. In run 9, all four sections of the main bed were operated in parallel, with no further effort to clear 1A and 1B and no indication of any change in pressure drop. After this run, electric heaters were installed on the inlets of 1A and 1B. Heating to 750°F for 8 hours brought the pressure drop back to the normal range for clean beds. Although the heaters could not be used in normal operation because the cooling-water level is above the inlet sections, they were left in place with leads brought out through the shield.

The early finding of organic material in the original charcoal-bed inlet valves, and the response of the pressure drop to heating, are good evidence that most of the trouble with pressure drop was caused by organics. Why the restriction built up so slowly in run 11 is not known.

Designs were completed during run 11 for more positive remedies for the high-pressure drop. These include a particle trap just ahead of the bed inlet manifold and piping to bypass the inlet section of each bed where the plug is believed to be.

I'm in the tower water. Before run 11, the cooler was replaced by an available surplus heat exchanger. The new exchanger has only two-thirds of the tube area of the old cooler, but the heat transfer coefficient is higher, resulting in about the same performance. Through the end of February, there was no evidence of leakage in the new cooler.

Space Coolers: Leaks had occurred in both reactor-cell space coolers at brazed joints on the brass tubing headers, and repairs had proved to be difficult because repair of one joint tended to open adjacent joints. Prior to run 8, both coolers (and all other in-cell components) were proved to be leak-tight; however, when operation was resumed, condensed moisture began to appear in the system recirculating the cell atmosphere. Although leakage from the space coolers was suspected, they could not be isolated for leak testing due to the high temperatures in the cell. In view of the discouraging experience with repairs, two replacement coolers were procured in which the headers and nipples were made of copper, and the troublesome joints were welded. (The Helium welding of copper to copper was done at ORNL).

Steady-state accumulation in the system was reduced from 8 ft to 6 ft by supplying the thermal shield slides with water pumped from a small vented tank. Before run 8, a 350-gal degassing tank was installed in the return line from the main thermal shield and slides. With this tank in the system, the gas accumulation at full power was reduced to 3 ft. The holdup was the same whether or not the slide supply tank was used in conjunction with the main degassing tank. The radiolytic gas being stripped from the water is diluted with air to below the explosive limit in the degassing tank and is then vented outside the reactor building.

Chemical Treatment. In the course of testing and repair of leaks in the treated water cooler, cooling tower water leaked into the treated water system. Before the reactor was started up in September, the resultant sodium contamination was reduced by dilution with condensate; after which, the required corrosion inhibitor concentration was restored by adding more lithium nitrite. Power operation was resumed with 1. Activation of the sodium raised the radiation levels around the water system but did not interfere with operation. After September, no more additions of corrosion inhibitor were required until January when some makeup was needed because of leaks.

In the cooling tower system, corrosion inhibition was achieved by daily additions of balls of Nalco 360 (sodium chromate and phosphate). To eliminate troublesome deposition of calcium phosphate on flowmeter tubes, the inhibitor was changed to a mixture of potassium dichromate and zinc sulfate.

Previous operation of the pumps had indicated insufficient capacity, and the speed of both units was increased during the shutdown after run 7. Operation was satisfactory in run 8, but in run 9, it became evident that there was a malfunction either in the output-pressure transmitter or in the pressure-control valve, PdCV-960. During the shutdown after run 9, inspection of PdCV-960 showed that the valve stem was stuck with the valve partly open. Deterioration in the operation of this valve probably also accounted for at least part of the apparent loss of capacity of the pumps. The valve operated satisfactorily after the valve was repacked, and the stem polished and lightly lubricated. A drain was installed at the discharge of the gas cooler, which should reduce moisture collection in the valve bonnet, and PdCV-960 is cycled periodically to ensure free stem.

During this same maintenance period, the butterfly check valve from CCP-1 was found to be inoperative and was repaired. The failure occurred at a silicone rubber hinge, which supports the two wings of the check valve. This check valve would prevent CCP-2 from developing pressure because the gas could short-circuit back through CCP-1 to the blower suction. This was the second reported failure of a check valve; it had been in service between 1548 and 3074 hr. A similar check valve had failed on CCP-2 in January 1966 after 1640 hr of operation and had been replaced by one made at ORNL as there was no spare on hand. The locally fabricated check valve was replaced in September 1966, although it had not failed after ~1800 hr.

Pump CCP-1 had to be stopped during run 10 because of low oil pressure, and CCP-2 was used for the remainder of the run. After run 10, a cracked copper fitting in the oil system was repaired, and 2 gallons of oil were added to bring the oil level back to normal.

The drive belts on the component-cooling pumps caused intermittent difficulties through run 7. Prior to run 8, the motor mounts were strengthened to reduce flexing, and deflectors were installed to aid in cooling the belts with the incoming gas. Even with the deflectors, a thermocouple near the belt of CCP-1 indicated an ambient temperature of 150 to 160°F. Although this is above the 130°F for which the belts are rated, inspection in December, after 1400 hr of operation, showed that the belts were in good condition, and only moderate tightening was required. There has been no evidence of belt slippage since the motor mounts were reinforced.

Oil leaking past the lower shaft seal in a salt pump collects in an external tank. Oil from the fuel pump, which had accumulated in earlier months at rates up to 20 cc/day, accumulated in October and November at about 5 cc/day. There was no accumulation in December, but in January, the oil began to collect again at about 5 cc/day. Seal leakage from the coolant pump, which had accumulated previously at about 2 cc/day, increased to about 17 cc/day. These rates are far below the 1000 cc/day that was originally set as acceptable.

During the shutdown prior to run 8, the entire electrical system at the reactor site was overhauled and put in good operating condition. Most of the major electrical breakers were tested and calibrated to ensure proper operation. One of the emergency power diesel generators (DG-3), which had a cracked engine block, was replaced with a unit of the same size obtained from another installation. In addition, the 250-hp motors for the main radiator blowers and the two 48-volt DC generators were inspected and reconditioned.

In general, the electrical system performed satisfactorily during this period. The emergency power generators are operated under load routinely for test purposes, and they have always operated when required. On September 30, a major power failure in the X-10 area caused an automatic fuse failure in the high-reliability AC power supply (static DC-AC inverter), which resulted in an unscheduled control-rod scram.

During the shutdown in September, a resistance check was conducted on all in-cell heaters at junction boxes located outside the reactor and drain-tank cell. Other than heater HX-1, which had partly failed before the shutdown, only one heater, H102-1S, was found to have failed. This was one of the three installed spare heaters on the vertical section of the pipe under the heat exchanger. No repairs were required since there is adequate capacity in the other heaters on this section.

The resistances of the coolant system heaters located outside of the reactor cell were also one on the coolant pump furnace, and the other one, a spare heater, was on the fill-line piping. It was necessary to replace only the heater on the 5-in. piping since there was adequate heater capacity at the other locations to preheat the coolant system.

After run 7, we found that the drop time for control rod 3 had increased slightly. While we were investigating this problem during the shutdown before run 8, the drop time increased still further and approached the limit of 1.3 sec. In addition, occasional hanging was observed when the rod was raised 2 in. from its fully inserted position. We removed the rod-drive assembly and found that the long drop times were caused by a bent cooling-air tube. The air tube presumably was bent when the drive unit was last reinstalled (February 1966). The hanging on rod withdrawal was attributed to interference between sharp edges at the bottom of the rod and a protrusion of a warped guide in the thimble. We replaced both the rod drive and the control rod with spare units after first rounding the sharp corners at the lower end of the spare rod. This relieved the hanging problem and gave an initial average rod-drop time (for 35 drops) of 0. 92 sec. (The drop time normally decreases because of increasing flexibility of the rod with continued use).

Shortly after the new assembly for control rod 3 was put in service, we observed a shift of about 0. 4 in. in the reference zero position as indicated by a special single-point indicator near the bottom of the rod thimble. There has been no subsequent change in the reference position, and the cause of the shift is not definitely known. However, when a similar shift occurred previously, it was attributed to slippage of a drive chain on a sprocket gear.

The fuel and coolant salt samplers met the requirements of the experimental program without delays or serious difficulties. As reported previously, flush salt that froze in the fuel sampler line during an accidental overfill was melted with external heaters. However, some obstruction.

The pump. Thereafter, there was no interference with sampling, nor any mechanical trouble of any consequence throughout the report period. Contamination, although adequately controlled, did become more of a problem because of the higher activity of the salt and the nature of some of the special devices that were lowered into the fuel pump.

During this reporting period, 66 samples were removed from the fuel system, and 8 were removed from the coolant system. Of the fuel-system samples, 43 were routine 10-g salt samples, 6 were large salt samples (50 g) for oxide analyses, and 17 were special-purpose samples related to studies of the oxidation state of uranium and fission product behavior.

Pipe tape was found in some of the valves, and cleaning and replacement of some soft seats corrected all of the leaks. The reactor and drain-tank cells were tested at 10 psig three times during the period. Before run 8, the measured leak rate was 65 scfd. Before run 10, 43 scfd. These rates are factors of 3.0 and 4.5 below the acceptable rate at 10 psig. The 10-psig test before run 11 was only long enough to show that the leak rate was acceptably low; no exact figure was obtained. For normal operation, the cell is held at -2 psig, and the permissible inleakage has been set conservatively at 85 scfd. This was based on an extrapolation from accident conditions which assumed orifice flow through all leaks. In run 9, the calculated inleakage increased to more than 300 scfd, and one reason for terminating the run was to investigate this problem. Several valve-operator pneumatic lines were found.

The net rate was only 62 scfd. In run 10, the pneumatic-line leaks were measured continuously and monitored deducted from the total inleakage, giving a net inleakage rate around 50 scfd. In run 11, after the air-line leaks were stopped, the measured inleakage was only about 10 scfd.

In case of a spill in the cell, block valves just outside the cell automatically shut off the lines if the cell goes above atmospheric pressure. Of course, these leaks must be taken into account in the calculations of the inleakage through other routes, and during run 10, flowmeters were used in the air lines to obtain the necessary information. The leakage from eight lines became quite large.

However, up to 3500 scfd, causing considerable uncertainty in the cell inleakage measurement. Nitrogen was substituted for air in the leaking lines to keep the oxygen concentration in the cell below 4% to rule out fire in the event of an oil leak.

After run 10, the pneumatic-line leaks were traced to quick-disconnects in which the neoprene seals had become embrittled. There were 18 disconnects with elastomer seals. Eight disconnects, all near the center of the reactor cell, were leaking. Seventeen of these disconnects were replaced with special adapters sealed at one end by an aluminum gasket and at the other by a standard metal-tubing compression fitting. One disconnect was left because it was on a line that is always at cell pressure. After the replacements, all 17 lines were proven to be leak-tight.

Activity Releases. Operation of the reactor was the direct cause of only two minor releases of activity to the ventilation stack. These occurred while capsules containing gas from the pump bowl were being removed through the sampler-enricher and involved 1 and 2 mE of iodine.

Continuous monitoring of the ventilation stack showed that a total of 206 mc of iodine and 9 me of particulate activity were released during the six-month report period. Most of this (192 mc) was released in December while the fuel off-gas line at the pump bowl was being probed.

Replacement of the fuel off-gas particle traps in September and again in January resulted in considerable contamination of the interior of the vent house. The area was cleaned to below contamination zone levels before operation was resumed.

Stack Fans and Filters. Stack flow was maintained continuously at a safe level throughout the period. The east stack fan was improved by the installation of new bearings, sheaves, and belts, as had been done earlier on the west fan. Before run 8, after other maintenance was finished, the roughing filters were replaced to reduce pressure drop and increase stack flow.

The effort of the development group consisted in work on the fission product off-gas removal system, on the sampler-enricher, and evaluation of the radioactive maintenance of the components. Several problems with the evaluation of their probable causes and solutions are given below. R. B. Gallaher. Forty-seven routine samples were taken during reactor runs 8, 9, 10, and part of 11. Of these, 11 were 50-g samples for oxide and us tyutt analysis. In addition to routine sampling, the sampler-enricher was used to perform a number of special sampling and addition operations as follows: 1. three samples containing absorptive wire for investigation of cover gas constituents, 2. two CuO capsules for determination of hydrocarbons in the cover gas, 3. three gas bombs for general cover gas analysis, 4. five capsules for addition of beryllium to the fuel. Refer to Chap. 7 of this report for a detailed discussion of the special samples.

Two small piles of salt, which cling to the outside of the capsule and are dislodged during handling, in the IC and 3A areas. Some difficulty has been encountered with the spread of contamination. (1) Interior areas of the sampler were decontaminated by wiping with adhesive tape and damp sponges, and (2) a ventilation duct connected to the main building ventilation system was installed near the transport cask position.

As an empty capsule assembly was being attached to the drive unit latch, the wire which connects the capsule to the key pulled free from the key. Fortunately, the operator retained his grip on the capsule so that it was not dropped into the sample withdrawal pipe.

The knot on the end of the wire was too small and had pulled through the key. Since then, all existing capsule assemblies have been reinspected. Also, new capsules have been fabricated using nickel-plated mild-steel tops in place of the original copper tops so that a magnet can be used for retrieval in the event a capsule is dropped into the withdrawal pipe.

There has been a gradual increase in leakage of buffer gas through the upper seat of the maintenance valve. This condition is apparently caused by an accumulation of salt particles on the seating surface. While the leak rate is relatively small (approximately 25 cm/min), it is sufficient to cause difficulty with proper operation of the interlock, which indicates that the valve is closed.

The sample withdrawal pipe (line 999) was plugged with flush salt on July 24, 1966. The plug, which was located about 2 ft above the pump bowl, was melted by means of electrical heaters clamped to the outside of the pipe. The melted salt drained down the pipe and formed a new plug immediately above the pump. This second plug was finally melted out by a combination of external heaters and heat from the pump bowl after the reactor system was brought up to normal operating temperature.

Manipulator Buffer System. At some time during the maintenance period, a small leak developed in the manipulator buffer system, and both boots were replaced. A small pinhole was found in the atmosphere-side boot. The cause of the hole was not determined. This set of boots had been used for 35 sample cycles.

Access Door Mechanism. During one sampling cycle, a cotter key was noticed on the floor of area 3A. Close examination of the access port door mechanism showed that the key had come out of the top of the lower hinge pin.

Vacuum Pumps. The radiation level in the vacuum pump enclosure was checked after a two-month cooling-off period (following shutdown on July 17, 1966). It was found that the radiation level was less than 100 mR/hr, which is low enough to permit direct maintenance work in this area. The oil level was checked on both pumps, and oil was added to one of the pumps.

Installation of the fuel processing sampler is complete except for the shielding. Leak testing and operational checks have been completed. The system was found to be satisfactory except for a defective part in the containment buffer system.

A hydrocarbon oxidizer, a CO and H2 absorber, and a second thermal conductivity cell have been added to the system. These components, acting in concert, will provide a measure of the level of hydrocarbon contamination in the off-gas stream. In addition, the oxidizer unit, by virtue of its position upstream of the molecular sieve trap, will serve to protect the latter from fouling by organic material.

The original design provided for sampling the off-gas stream at a point immediately downstream of the particle filter in the reactor off-gas line, specifically line 522. The piping has now been rearranged to provide an additional sample point immediately upstream of the 522 filter. Except for the approximate 40-min delay time, samples from the upstream point should be identical with pump bowl exit gas. Also, by using the hydrocarbon detector (see item 2 above), results from the two sample points may be used to judge the relative effectiveness of the off-gas filter. Gas will be routed to the sampler by way of existing lines (533, 561, and 538), so that the changes associated with the new sample point will be restricted to piping internal to the sampler.

The off-gas filter installed in line 522 in March 1966 consisted of a particle trap, or prefilter, and a charcoal filter. Experience during operations plus hot-cell examination of the particle trap after removal from the system indicated that the particle trap was too small and that the charcoal filter was unnecessary. The new particle traps, shown in Fig. 2, are similar to the old unit except for the following revisions.

The unit was, in effect, turned upside down so that the Yorkmesh section is at the top of the unit, and the Fiberfrax section is at the bottom. Pipe connections were adjusted to compensate for this change so that the flow path is now downwards through the filter.

The concentration of particles in the off-gas stream is such that the rate of accumulation on the filter is on the order of 1 g/day. This estimate is based on the assumption that salt entrainment is negligible; the daughter product deposition rate is ~0. 1 g/day (approximately 1% of 7. 5 g of 35U per day), and the pump oil leakage averages 4 g/day, of which 25% is converted to solids, which are deposited on the particle trap.

The particles were generated by evaporation of hexane from very fine droplets of a hexane solution containing the solid under study, which was aspirated into the flowing gas stream. The concentration of these solutions and the flow conditions at the aspirator were held constant, such that the particle size could be expected to be the same for the three solids studied. Dave Moulton of Reactor Chemistry was responsible for the conception and development of the particle generator. The test was divided into two phases.

Using stearic acid, the effect of support screen position on load capacity was measured. The support screen, a thin perforated metal sheet, is normally placed on the downstream side of the felt metal to provide mechanical support in the event of excessive pressure drop across the filter.

The test results are summarized in Table 2. 1. The relative capacity of the Feltmetal for naphthalene/stearic acid/paraffin was found to be about 1000/5/1. If these figures are applied to the reactor system at a collection rate of 1 g/day, the life expectancy of the new MSRE particle trap (see Sect. 2. 5) might be as little as 3 weeks or as much as 70 years, depending on the character of the material collected. This estimate is based on a Feltmetal area of 280 in².

The setup for the pressure drop tests is shown in Fig. 2. 4. Helium was metered to the particle trap through a calibrated flowmeter at a metering pressure of 10 psig. Flow was controlled at V-1, and the pressure drop was assumed to be the PI reading since the gas was vented to the hot cell. Various flows; three ⅛-inch-diameter holes were drilled through the wall of the trap to permit the flow to yield results of the pressure drop measurements made on the clean filter before installation in the MSRE.

The particle trap was disassembled to permit examination of the three main sections of the trap. The cuts were made with a bandsaw, which is part of the hot-cell equipment in the HRLEL. All operations of handling, cutting, shifting, disassembling, sampling, weighing, photographing, and preparing samples for shipment were done by the experienced operators of the HRLEL using manipulators with direct and periscopic viewing, and the work suffered very little from the remote.

Yorkmesh section. The area of the Yorkmesh which had been immediately below the inlet pipe was covered with a blue-gray to black mat, which had completely filled the space between the wires of the mesh. The shape of the mat corresponded to the bottom of the inlet.

Since the inlet pipe temperature probably increased several hundred degrees during power operation of the reactor, it is believed that this restriction behaved much like a thermal valve. This could account for the unexpected increase in pressure drop while at power and the decrease in pressure drop when the power was reduced. In laboratory tests using a sample of the porous metal to filter an oil mist, a rise in temperature caused a decrease in the pressure drop of a loaded filter. This predictable result was attributed to boil-off of the oil.

A radiation survey made around the outside surface of this lower section of the trap, the position formerly occupied by the inlet pipe, revealed that the radiation level dropped off to 4100 μ/hr at the bottom of the trap. The bottom of the inlet pipe had a deposit of blackish material which corresponded to that in the Yorkmesh. The inside of the inlet pipe at the upper end of the bellows appeared clean and free of deposit. The exterior of the bellows had some of the light-yellow powdery material on a background of dark brown.

The outer shell of the lower section was slit at the weld, and the Yorkmesh was removed. It was found that the surface of the outer wires of the mesh bundle was covered with a thin layer of amber-colored organic material. Much of this material evaporated from the heat of the floodlamp used to make the photographs.

The black material was thicker than the wire by a factor of 2 or 3. This material was brittle, as was the wire, and much of it came loose as the wire was flexed. Samples of this material designated Nos. 5B and 6 were taken for examination and chemical analysis.

A piece of the wire covered with the black material was removed and mounted for metallographic examination, and it was found to be heavily carburized with a continuous network of carbide in the grain boundaries. There was no evidence of melting of the wire; however, the grain growth and other changes indicated operating temperatures of at least 1200°F. The nonmetallic material had been deposited in layers. These “growth rings" were probably the result of off-gas temperature.

Porous Metal Sect: The perforated plate of the coarse filter section and the lower flange of the filter assembly were covered with a stratified scale (view AA, 0. 6). The color varied from a very light yellow to orange. One stratum in the lower flange area appeared gray, almost.

Cell background (4. 2 r/hr) was at the discharge end of the Fiberfrax section. It is probable that this activity resulted from pressure transients, which could have carried gaseous decay products from the charcoal trap back upstream into the particle trap. Even so, the activity level was only.

For sections of sample 3A, it was found that about the same weight loss (0. 2% of sample weight) resulted from heating to 600°C in helium as from dipping in a trichloroethylene bath. The material removed by heating was cold-trapped and found to be effectively decontaminated; however, the trichloroethylene wash was contaminated with fission products.

Samples 5B and 9 were compared for low-temperature volatiles at 150°C. No. 9 lost 5%, and No. 5B lost none. When raised to 600°C, the weight losses were about the same, 35% for sample 5B and 32% for sample 9. Analysis of the carbon content gave none for sample 9 and 9% for sample 5B. This indicates that sample 9 had not reached as high a temperature as sample 5B had.

In addition, the material in samples 5B and 6 contained small quantities of Cr, Fe, and Ni, while sample 9 did not. The reliability of these values is compromised by difficulties caused by the presence of organics and small sections of wire in the sample.

The fraction of soluble hydrocarbons was determined using CSA, and the values were 5B (60%), 6 (73%), and 9 (80%). The extract solutions from samples 5B and 6 were allowed to evaporate, and a few milligrams of the residue were mounted between salt crystals for infrared analysis. The samples were identical and were characteristic of long-chain hydrocarbons. There was no evidence of any functional groups other than those involving carbon and hydrogen, nor was there any evidence suggesting double or triple bonds. There was an indication of a possible mild cross-linkage. It is high operating temperatures of the wire mesh that would cause breakdown of the organic into elemental carbon and volatiles.

The high activity and the large amount of barium and strontium in the inlet section of the particle trap indicate that a large fraction of the solid daughters of Kr and Xe, which decay in the line, is carried down the line with the off-gas stream.

The measured concentrations of various fission products in the MSRE graphite samples were listed as a function of depth in the samples in the previous progress report. Three of these materials are daughters of very short-lived noble gases, 140Ba from (16-sec) 140Xe, 141Ce from (1. 7-sec) 141Xe, and 91Y from (10-sec) 91Kr. It can be shown that with the reactor at power.

The very short-lived noble gas concentration distribution in graphite is approached very shortly after the reactor is brought to power. Also, the daughter product concentration can be taken through the period when the reactor is shut down by considering decay only. This model assumes that once a noble gas decays, its daughter is immediately adsorbed by graphite and does not migrate.

August 26, 7822 Mwhr. A removable section of off-gas line 522 was replaced. This spool piece was replaced because it was suspected of having a plug of frozen salt. This was the hottest piece removed from the reactor, approximately 2000 t/hr. It was removed with blind flanges on both ends for containment.

September 9: The west space cooler that had been removed in the previous period for repair of a water leak was replaced. The assembly had some wipeable contamination, which was removed at the decontamination facility. There were some local spots of induced radiation of up to 400 mr/hr at 6 in. The leak, which existed in a brazed joint, was rebrazed directly under Health.

Thawed. By using a series of remotely manipulated external heaters, we managed to move the frozen salt down the pipe to within 3 inches of the end. The final thawing of this line required using the heat from the circulating flush salt plus that from several small ceramic heaters, which had to be remotely positioned in the complex area around the pump tank and line 999. This was a totally unanticipated job, and much of the difficulty was due to the crowding of various equipment.

November 23, 11,236 MWhr. — The plug in line 522 was removed by direct means. External heaters, chisel-type rods, a flexible shaft snake to clear a pipe with two 90° bends, and a borescope were used on this job. The flexible pipe spool piece was replaced in order to make sure that this line was open. 70 1/hr at tool penetrations was a definite factor in slowing down.

December 5, 11,236 MWh. We removed, repaired, and reinstalled valve 960, which controls the component cooling air. Gamma radiation was significantly lower here than for the job on line 522. Induced radiation in the valve (less than 20 mR/hr) was low enough to allow contact repair of the valve stem.

Control of the spread of contamination is becoming more difficult and requires a greater portion of our time and effort. In the effort to remove the plug of frozen salt in the off-gas line 522 (see entry for November 23), a number of very contaminated long-handled tools were accumulated. pipe. During the replacement of the particle trap in the off-gas system (see entry for January 16), airborne contamination required the use of gas masks and many man-hours of cleanup work.

The work that was accomplished involved the off-gas system and auxiliary valves. Much of this work was unanticipated, requiring new tools and procedures. In all cases, there were tight schedule demands that were met. One may conclude that the increase in skill and experience has been at least equalled by an increase in difficulty arising from the radiation and contamination.

During the 2631-hour test of the MK-1 prototype pump reported previously, there was evidence of a restriction in the annulus between the pump shaft and the shield plug at the lower end. Post-test examination revealed the restriction to be salt of a composition similar to that circulated by the pump, so it could not have been produced by condensation of salt vapor. We believe that this salt entered the annulus during a previous loop filling operation. The test loop is filled by pressurizing the drain tank with helium to displace salt into the loop through a fill and drain line. Because there was insufficient salt in the drain tank, the liquid level in the tank dropped to the fill-line entrance before the loop was filled to the desired level. Gas then passed through the line into the loop and raised the level in the pump tank high enough to carry salt into the annulus. Some of the salt froze there and remained when the level subsided as the gas entered the pump tank.

The MK-2 pump was designed to replace the MSRE fuel pump if the pump tank in the reactor system were to fail. The MK-2 pump tank has the same diameter as the MK-1 tank but was made longer to provide the desired expansion volume for salt without an overflow tank below the pump. The longer pump tank made it necessary to increase the unsupported length of the pump shaft. Also, some changes were made in the mechanics of contacting salt and cover gas to remove gaseous fission products from the salt. These and other features of the new pump will be tested before it is considered suitable for use in the MSRE.

Shaft deflection and critical speed tests were performed on the rotary element for the MK-2 pump. The measured critical frequency was 1860 cpm, which compares favorably with the predicted value of 1800 cpm. Fabrication of the pump tank is about 70% complete.

The discharge nozzles of the MK-1 and MK-2 pumps penetrate the pump tank in the region of the junction of the bottom head with the cylindrical side. This unusual configuration greatly increases the uncertainty in the calculation of stresses in the nozzle and the tank wall. Hence, we decided to use the MK-1 pump tank to obtain a simple comparison between calculated and measured stresses produced by internal pressure and by forces and moments imposed by the discharge.

A fixture was designed and fabricated for holding the tank and for applying forces and moments to the discharge nozzle. Stress-Coat tests were initiated, and a crack in the tank was found in the heat-affected zone of the weld joining the nozzle to the tank. The Hastelloy N from which the tank and weldments were made came from early experimental heats, which are now known to be crack-sensitive. We believe that microfissures were present in the welds when the pump was new and that they enlarged to form a visible crack, either under the stresses present during 15,000 hr of operation at temperatures from 1000 to 1500°F, or during the initial Stress-Coat test. The crack was repaired by welding, and exploratory strain measurements are being made to determine whether we can obtain valid data.

We reported previously on the testing of the spare rotary elements for the fuel and coolant pumps of the MSRE. The spare element for the coolant pump ran satisfactorily, but the one for the fuel pump leaked oil excessively through the lower shaft seal. The rotary elements are identical except for the impellers and the arrangement of service piping, which is installed at the reactor site. It is being held in standby for the reactor.

The cause for the excessive seal leakage in the other rotary element was investigated. The stationary part of the seal has a Graphitar ring supported on a stainless steel bellows. The Graphitar ring bears on a carbon steel ring on the pump shaft. The bellows has a weld down one side, which increases the stiffness of that side. This lack of uniformity and possibly the way in which the seal leaked excessively. The bellows was adjusted to improve the parallelism and concentricity of the seal rings; the pump was reassembled, and the testing was completed. The rate of oil leakage through the lower seal was only 21 cm/day at reactor operating conditions.

The design of instrumentation and controls for the off-gas sampler was continued. This design work was temporarily stopped in April 1966 because of uncertainties concerning the chromatograph and the possible effects of particulate matter found to be present in the off-gas system. Work on the design of a revised off-gas sampler system was resumed in August and is now essentially complete.

The chromatograph system included in the original design was removed; a copper oxide scrubber was added for the removal of hydrocarbons from the sample gas. A second thermal conductivity cell was added for checking the efficiency of the copper oxide.

Control Instrumentation Additions and Modifications. Further additions to and modifications of the instrumentation and control systems were made to provide additional protection, improve performance, and provide more information for the operators. The remaining 13 requests required changes to process switch operating setpoints. Some examples of these changes follow.

Master Control Circuits. Two new jumpers and associated circuitry were installed to provide a bypass around the frozen permissive contacts of freeze valves 105 and 106 in the drain tank helium supply valve control circuit. This makes it possible for the operator to transfer fuel salt between drain tanks FD1 and FD2 through the reactor fill lines 105 and 106. To prevent inadvertent transfer of fuel salt to the reactor core, the circuits were originally designed to prevent transfers by this route. Transfers were permitted through the transfer lines only.

The design of the jumper board graphic panel was revised to incorporate recent control circuit changes and a newly devised system of identification for all jumper plug receptacles and lamps. Procurement of four new metal-photoengraved graphic panels required for this revision is underway.

Fuel and Coolant Pumps — The design and installation of circuitry that permits the operators to override all protective interlocks in the coolant-salt circulating pump control circuit were completed. New operating criteria stipulated that preventing salt from freezing in the radiator is more important than protecting the pump from possible damage resulting from the bypassed interlocks. The design included a manual switch connected directly in the power circuit breaker close and trip coil circuits. The power distribution system was not altered.

As part of the system revisions made to prevent plugging of the off-gas system, the fuel pump bowl pressure control valve was removed from the system. The change was made because the desired degree of control can be affected by other means, and the space was needed for installation of a particle trap.

The instrumentation and controls for this system, which include double-stage pressure regulation, high-pressure alarms, variable area flowmeters, and several pressure indicators, were designed to protect the reactor fuel system from the possible application of overpressure and to maintain the integrity of the primary containment.

A bubbler-type level measuring system was installed in the vent house to indicate the water level in the charcoal filter pit. These thermocouples were originally connected to a single-point indicator through a manual selector switch.

Bearing of the two large blowers, and each element produces electrical signals proportional to the velocity of the mechanical vibrations. The vibration signal analyzer indicates the average velocity and the peak-to-peak displacement of the vibrations. Prior to installation, the system, to the vibration instruments, a thermocouple was installed in a well drained into each of the four bearing housings and was connected to the data logger through the thermocouple patch panel. The load setback interlocks were removed from the load control circuits. This action, designed to lower the radiator doors, under certain conditions, to the intermediate or 1-MW output.

A number of instruments in one safety circuit channel are supplied from the 48 V DC bus through a 1 kW inverter. A loss of power to these instruments could cause the reactor to drain unnecessarily. A circuit was designed and installed that will automatically transfer the load from the 1 kW inverter to the reliable power distribution panel IPP3 if the inverter should fail.

Secondary Containment. Just before the January shutdown of the reactor, it was becoming increasingly difficult to maintain the proper atmosphere in the reactor cell because of leaks from the lines supplying air to the in-cell control valves. Several temporary corrective measures, such as installing flow meters to locate the leaks and connecting the operators to a nitrogen supply, were taken so that operations could continue until the time for a scheduled shutdown. During the shutdown, it was determined that the neoprene O-ring seals in the remote disconnects had failed.

A fixed bypass restriction is installed between the operator supply and vent lines to provide a path for pressures on the valve operator to equalize so that the valve can move to the fail-safe position when the reactor cell containment block valves close. During normal operations, the flow through these restrictors was large enough to cause a pressure buildup in the vent header, which produced undesirable effects on other valves connected to the same header. To correct this problem, the vent lines from the reference side of the operators on in-cell control valves P gc V-960A.

During a routine test, one of the two high-level switches in the vapor suppression tank was found to be defective. Loss of this switch caused the loss of one channel of information needed to establish that the water level in the tank was correct. This installation utilized a dip tube which was included in the original design in anticipation of such need. This new level system will also enable the operator to check the water level in the tanks as a routine procedure.

Sampling and Enriching Systems: Except for adjustments to operating switch setpoints and annunciator revisions, the instrumentation and controls on the fuel sampler-enricher have not been changed. Alternate circuit arrangements are now being considered.

The annunciator circuits for high radiation in the containment areas of the fuel sampler-enricher were revised for the convenience of the operator. The existing circuits announce high radiation directly each time it occurs, and frequent announcements are normal during certain stages of sampling. The revised circuit operates to block out the annunciator after the first alarm is silenced until the safety interlock circuits are manually reset.

Replacements were received for all 139 relays that operate from the 48 V DC system. These relays were overheating and destroying the Bakelite frame due to faulty relay coil design. Twenty of the relays were replaced, and the rest will be replaced at the next convenient shutdown.

Operation of the relay matrix in the nuclear system generated considerable noise, making it difficult to reset the safety system channels. The existing resistor-diode combination for damping the voltage induced by relay operation was replaced by a Zener diode and a diode combination that was more satisfactory.

A capacitor in an Electra-systems module failed, causing a reactor shutdown. All capacitors in these modules will be tested during the next shutdown. Multiple setpoints were detected on several modules. These were fixed by changing resistors to compensate for transistor aging.

Radiation monitor RM 6010 has its output recorded by the data logger; however, the range of this instrument can be changed by a switch on the front panel. Additional contacts were.

Five spurious rod scrams were experienced during the reporting period. None were caused by malfunction or failure in the reliable rod scram instrumentation. Three of these scrams were the result of human errors, and the remaining two were caused by equipment failures. One of these equipment failures was in the radiation monitoring instrumentation, RM-528, on the off-gas line from the coolant circulating pump. This is a two-channel system, and a failure in either channel will stop the fuel circulating pump and thereby reduce the rod scram setpoint to 15 kW. At the time this failure occurred, the reactor was developing over 7 MW. The other equipment failure was in an overvoltage relay in the 60-kVA power supply, resulting in a momentary loss of power.

The reactivity-balance calculation was refined to the point where it now produces meaningful numbers. In order to maintain system continuity in the event of a shutdown and subsequent restart, a program was added that writes information necessary for initialization of the system on the drum memory once each minute and on magnetic tape once each hour. Certain reactivity balance parameters are among these data. In the event of a computer malfunction, which causes an automatic restart of the system, the initialization information last written on the magnetic drum memory is used to restore the core memory. For restart after shutdowns involving malfunctions which may have destroyed the drum data, the last information written on magnetic tape is used to initialize the system. The availability and use of these drum and magnetic tape data have made the system easier to use and have given an extra margin of continuity assurance against.

Several new operator request functions were added to the system, and a number of others were modified to eliminate some possible conflicts between functions. Functions added included three demand log-type requests that list those scan points on which alarm functions have been modified by previous operator requests. Also added was a request function to facilitate updating (when fuel is added) the numerical quantity of fuel used in the reactivity-balance calculation. The engineering units conversion equation for this signal was modified to read the selector switch position and convert the analog input signal accordingly. This change was made to provide the best possible resolution of the instrument reading under all operating conditions, as this radiation level varies from a few milliroentgens per hour to several hundred roentgens per hour, depending upon the status of the reactor.

The performance of developmental instrumentation installed on the MSRE continued to be generally satisfactory. Although some isolated failures and deviations from optimum performance occurred, they were minor in nature and correctable by routine repair and adjustment.

Since the operation of MSRE developmental instrumentation has become routine, the details are limited to those associated with the initiation or termination of development efforts.

The analysis revealed that none of the commercially available devices considered was suitable for use as a direct replacement for the MSRE switches and that the cost of all was prohibitive for the intended service. Several of the devices, however, showed promise for use in more conventional applications.

Since no salt has been transferred to or from the fuel storage tank during this report period, there has been no opportunity to check the effectiveness of modifications of probe circuitry previously reported. They were made to eliminate the excessive frequency drift experienced in the excitation oscillator associated with this probe.

A conductivity-type level indicator has been developed for use in a fuel distillation system, which will be installed at the MSRE and has been successfully tested in the MSRP level test facility. This level indicator is similar in operation and construction to the conductivity-type system used to obtain single-point indication of level in the MSRE drain tanks, but differs in that the probe is smaller in size, and the new system will provide a usable indication of level changes. The range of this instrument is limited to approximately 30% of the length of the signal.

A way of reducing the effect of this nonlinearity in the molten-salt level ranges required for this experiment is to increase the length of the signal-generating section so that the bottom 30% of the probe covers the desired range. This was accomplished without exceeding the limitations on the overall length of the instrument by folding the excitation section as shown in Fig. 3. Preliminary drawings for this system have been completed and are now being circulated for approval. This level indicator will be constructed of INOR-8.

Pump at the MSRE in that the float is inside the pump bowl, and the range is 7 in. instead of 5 in. Also, as previously reported, the method of transformer mounting will not permit removal for repair or replacement. Once installed, it must remain on the pump bowl until the pump is removed.

Factor core. In the MSRE, a small fraction of the total neutron reactions do occur in the regions which surround the central graphite-moderated region (i. e. , the peripheral downcomer and the lower and upper salt plenums). In these locations, the neutron spectrum can differ somewhat from that in the central region.

The THERMOS codes. The former calculates the epithermal energy spectrum of the neutron flux (the flux above energies where thermal motion of the moderator nuclei exerts a strong influence on the neutron spectrum). The latter calculates the spectrum in the thermal.

The energy dependence of the epithermal and the thermal neutron spectra in the MSRE core. In these calculations, the core was represented as a right circular cylinder (R x H = 29 x 78 in. ).

In this energy region, where most of the important resonance effects in the neutron reactions occur, the lethargy variable is used for theoretical and computational convenience. For ease of interpretation, we have included a logarithmic energy scale. The calculated fluxes per unit lethargy for each group in GAM-II are shown as solid points, with the points connected by straight line segments. The flux spectrum is normalized to one source neutron produced from fission. In the GAM-II model, this flux spectrum corresponds.

In a single-region reactor, consisting of a homogeneous mixture of graphite and fuel salt, corrections have been introduced for the fuel channel geometric self-shielding of the absorption resonances in 8U. The physical neutron spectrum corresponding most closely to this theoretically calculated flux should be the spectrum within the graphite, reflecting the general characteristics of the fission spectrum. At lower energies (increased lethargies), there is a transition to the spectrum of scattered and moderated neutrons. The irregular dependence on energy of some of the group fluxes in the transition region can be identified with the effects of neutron resonance scattering in the light elements in the fuel salt (Li, Be).

As indicated in Table 5. 2, the cross sections are averaged over that portion of the high-energy spectrum of 0. 1 for which the magnitude of the cross section is significant. The lower cutoff energy listed is that value chosen from the GAM-II group structure which corresponds most closely with the physical cutoff energy for the particular reaction considered. The upper cutoff energy is 15 MeV for all reactions. The calculated magnitudes of the neutron fluxes in these energy intervals, averaged over the volume of the core, are also given.

In the MSRE, the rate of depletion of the 745U fuel charge is sufficiently low that some convenient first-order approximations can be used in calculating the changes in isotopic composition of the fuel salt. We have assumed that the magnitude and energy spectrum of the neutron flux remain constant during operation at a given power level. We have used the calculated fuel salt. " Thus, the calculated volume-average thermal flux for the entire fuel loop is 6.7 x 10^11 neutrons cm^-2.

To a good approximation, all the rates given in Table 5.3 may be assumed constant during a large fraction of the exposure life of the current fuel charge. For example, after one year's operation of the MSRE at 7.5 MW, the maximum corrections due to saturation effects would reduce the concentrations of 74Pu and tritium, calculated according to the linear approximation, by about 11% and 4% respectively.

In addition to the burnup of 235U during power operation, the changes in the concentrations of the residual 10B in the graphite induce reactivity changes which are important in the analysis of the nuclear behavior of the core. We shall exclude 235U from consideration here since a separate detailed account is taken of its inventory-reactivity changes in the analysis of operations. Most of the remaining effects given above manifest themselves as very slowly developing positive reactivity changes dependent on the time integral of the power or energy generated.

The boron concentration present initially in the MSRE graphite was estimated from MSR Program Semiann calculation. The reactivity effect neglects a correction factor accounting for the spatial dependence of the boron burnout in the graphite.

Studies were continued with the purpose of correlating the time behavior of the 135Xe poisoning observed in the MSRE with calculations from a theoretical model. The mathematical model used for this purpose has been previously described in references 6 and 7.

The theoretical model is an extension of the steady-state model described in Ref. 8 to include the transient behavior of the 135Xe reactivity following a step change in reactor power level. In the model chosen, we have assumed that all the 135I produced from fission remains in circulation with the salt. After decay to 135Xe, the xenon migrates to the accessible pores of the graphite at the boundaries of the fuel channels and also to minute helium bubbles distributed through the circulating salt stream. An effective mass transfer coefficient was used to describe the transfer of xenon from solution in the circulating salt to the interface between the liquid and the graphite pores at the channel boundaries. Equilibrium Henry's law coefficients were used for the mass transfer of xenon between the liquid phase at the interface.

Similar considerations were assumed to apply to the mass transfer of xenon from a liquid solution to the gas bubbles. The coefficient of mass transfer from the liquid to a small gas bubble, of the order of 0. 010 in. in diameter, moving through the main part of a fuel channel, was estimated from theoretical mass transfer correlations. The equilibrium ^135Xe poisoning was found to be relatively insensitive to the bubble diameter and mass transfer coefficient over a reasonable range of uncertainty for these parameters.

Calculations of the steady-state Xe poisoning, reported in reference 7, indicated that the low apparent poisoning as a function of power level could be described by a variety of combinations of circulating bubble volume fractions and bubble-stripping efficiency. One of the purposes of the transient calculations, therefore, was to attempt to separate those parameter effects which could not be separated in the steady-state calculations.

A number of transient reactivity curves were calculated with the aid of an IBM 7090 program based on the theoretical model described above. These calculations were compared with experimental data logged by the reactors BR 340 online computer. The apparent transient 135Xe poisoning was determined by subtracting all other known power-dependent reactivity effects from the reactivity change represented by movement of the regulating rod following a step change in the power level.

This analysis with some experimental transients, in the chronological order in which they were obtained. In each of these figures, the solid curves represent the calculated behavior, and the plotted points show the observed experimental reactivity effect. However, several characteristics of the 135Xe behavior are indicated from these curves. These will be discussed by considering the figures in order.

A single bubble stripping efficiency of 10% was used for this figure. This relatively low efficiency is approximately equal to the efficiency estimated for the stripping of xenon dissolved in the salt. It was considered to be a lower limit and a reasonable first approximation for this parameter, in the absence of strong evidence for assuming a higher value for the bubbles. The effectiveness of the circulating gas in reducing the poison level is due to the.

Figures 5.5 and 5.6 show the calculated and observed transient buildup of ^{15}Xe poisoning after a step increase in power from 0 to 5. 7 MW in run 8 (October 1966). The ranges of values one finds indicate that the shape of the observed transient is matched more closely by the calculations that assume a low void fraction and a high bubble stripping efficiency.

For the early part of the transient, which is shown in this figure, since the reactor was made subcritical before the complete xenon transient could be recorded, the calculated curves reveal an important characteristic of the transient xenon behavior, which is due to variations in the overall xenon distribution that result from the choice of values for a.

Erewhile, only a small amount of xenon is in the circulating fluid. Xenon produced in the fluid from iodine decay continues to migrate to the graphite for a period of time after the power (and hence the burnout rate in the neutron flux) has been reduced. This produces a shutdown peak in the xenon poisoning. Eventually, the stripping process reduces the xenon concentration in the fluid so that some of the xenon in the graphite can escape and be stripped out. This results in a more rapid decrease in xenon poisoning than simple radioactive decay.

The circulating void fraction is increased; a larger fraction of the xenon inventory (or poisoning) is associated with the bubbles, and there is less xenon migration to the graphite. In this case, the shutdown peak tends to disappear. This characteristic makes the shutdown transients somewhat more sensitive to the values of the bubble parameters and, potentially, more useful in the analysis of the xenon behavior.

The effect of increasing the bubble stripping efficiency, with the circulating void fraction held of experimental data for this transient is too limited to allow a valid comparison to be made. The lack of any apparent shutdown peak in the experimental data, however, seems to suggest that a larger amount of gas may have been in circulation at the beginning of the shutdown (termination of run 8) than was apparent at the beginning of the run (6).

In this case, a slight rise in the apparent poisoning following shutdown was indeed observed. From comparisons of the results given in these two figures, it appears that under normal operating conditions, a and € might be bracketed between 0.1 and 0.15 vol% and 50 to 100%.

"Best values of the circulating void fraction and bubble-stripping efficiency. As one example, it should be noted that if gas bubbles are continuously being ingested into the main circulating stream, as the evidence indicates, the volume of gas in circulation is probably not constant, but rather a slowly varying quantity depending on the level of the liquid in the fuel pump tank and the transfer rate of salt to the overflow tank. This dependence is as yet not well understood, and future operation is expected to shed further light in this area. Other refinements of the model for the xenon behavior may be required as reactor operating data are accumulated. These refinements are not expected to strongly affect the conclusions indicated in the preceding description. ".

Several stringers of Hastelloy N test specimens were located in an axial position near the center line of the MSRE for surveillance purposes. These specimens were from heats 5085 and 10°C, during which the reactor had operated 7612 MWhr. The peak-to-minimum thermal flux over the length of the test specimen array was a factor of 5, but this was not found to be a significant variable in this evaluation. The details of the removal of the specimens have been described previously, but we want to mention again that there was some bowing at various points along the surveillance assembly. "We used an optical comparator to eliminate those specimens. ".

Note also the extensive carbide precipitation that has occurred along the grain and twin boundaries during the exposure. A similar surface reaction layer was noted on samples from heat 5081 but did not occur as frequently. The 20-mil-thick Hastelloy N straps (heat 5055) that bound the graphite specimens also had such a reaction product on the sides that contacted the graphite. These straps showed limited ductility when bent at room temperature. They tended to break intergranularly in the reaction region when bent sharply. Although we have not made a positive identification of the surface layer, we assume that it is a carbide produced by a reaction between Hastelloy N and graphite.

The total elongation at fracture when deformed at a strain rate of 0.05 min per function of temperature is 0.2. Both heats show some reduction in ductility in the irradiated condition.

Perception of these values, the ductilities remained essentially constant up to temperatures of 500°C. At temperatures above 500°C, the ductility of the irradiated and the control material decreases with increasing temperature, with the irradiated material showing a greater loss in ductility.

Figures 6.4 and 6.5 show how the ratio of the irradiated to the unirradiated tensile property varies for heats 5081 and 5085, respectively, as a function of temperature. For both heats, the yield strength is unchanged by irradiation. The ultimate tensile stress is reduced by about 8% up to a temperature of about 500°C, where the reduction becomes considerably greater. The reduction in ductility at room temperature and at elevated temperatures is also clearly demonstrated.

We have compared the irradiated and control surveillance specimens. Let us now look at how the properties of the control specimens have changed during their 4800 hours of thermal exposure to molten salt. Table 6. 1 shows representative properties of heat 5085 after several different heat treatments. The first group of tests was run with the material in the as-received condition.

Into the reactor, and the properties of the material in this state are also indicated in Table 6. 1. The properties at 25°C were unchanged, and slight reductions in tensile strength and ductility were noted at a test temperature of 650°C. After exposure to salt for 4800 hours at 650°C, there.

Some of the test specimens have been examined metallographically. Figure 6. 6 shows the microstructure of control specimen No. AC-8 from heat 5081, which was tested at 25°C. This specimen exhibited good ductility, and this is reflected in the intragranular shear-type fracture and the lack of intergranular cracking. Figure 6. The control and irradiated specimens from heat 5085 tested at 25°C exhibited the same general characteristics as those illustrated in Figure 6. 7. The other specimens examined were tested at 650°C.

We compared the ductilities of the surveillance specimens with those for specimens irradiated in other experiments without salt present. Heat 5081 had been irradiated previously in the ORR. The ORR experiment was run at 700°C to a thermal dose of 9 x 10° nvt, and the material was in the as-received condition. Figure 6. 8 shows that the post-irradiation ductilities of heat 5081 after both experiments are very similar.

The surveillance specimens were exposed to a thermal dose of 1. 3 x 10^7 °NVT. (The MSRE vessel will reach this dose after about 150,000 MWh of operation. ) This burned out about 30% of the °B and produced a helium content of about 1075 atom fraction in both heats. The high-temperature tensile properties are exactly what we would expect for this dose. Our in-cell and post-irradiation creep tests, on several MSRE heats, indicate that the creep ductility will be in the range of 0. 5 to 3%, with the higher values being noted for lower stresses (or longer rupture).

We are reasonably confident that our tests on the surveillance specimens will indicate similar behavior. Our work also seems to indicate a saturation in the degree of radiation damage at a helium atom fraction of about 10^-5, and we feel that the properties of the material will not deteriorate further. The low-temperature ductility reduction was not expected. It is probably a result of grain-boundary precipitates forming due to the long thermal exposure. Irradiation plays some role in this process that is yet undefined.

Since the surveillance assembly holder was deformed, it was not possible to remove only part of the specimens and return the remainder to the MSRE; therefore, all 162 specimens were removed. The number of specimens required for actual surveillance purposes was rather small, and we used the others for learning more about the general radiation damage characteristics.

Table 6. 3 shows the post-irradiation tensile properties of several heats of Hastelloy N. Heat 5085 shows properties that are very similar to those observed for the surveillance specimens, with a temperature that shows a significant reduction in ductility at 25°C.

Fired to 3000°C and has not had any impregnations to decrease its pore sizes. Except for some minor flaws, the structure is unusually tight. This is also shown by the pore spectrum. Larger pore entrances shown may be the result of the small cracks and voids visible in. 15.

The other grades are materials that were originally developed for other purposes. As one might expect, the major problems with these are high gas permeabilities and pores that are too large. All of these had pore entrance diameters as large as 3 μ, whether they had uniform or not.

An interesting feature of six of the grades of graphite above that had pore entrance diameters as large as 3 μm was that the impregnations appeared to decrease the accessible void volumes but did not lower the range of the pore entrance diameters.

Decreasing the accessible void volume is helpful, but having the pore entrance diameters less than 1 µm is of greater importance.

Irradiation experiments to demonstrate the ability of graphite to sustain massive neutron exposures have been designed and are being fabricated or are in progress. Graphite of MSBR obtained from capsules placed in the HFIR. The specimens will be located in two rod assemblies, which will replace two of the californium production rod assemblies. All the 32 graphite ring specimens in the rod assembly are designed to be irradiated at 700 + 25°C. After a one-reactor cycle experiment to verify the design temperature, the specimens will be removed, examined, and recycled alternately every six months until a total irradiation time of 24 years is obtained. At this time, the total irradiation exposure will range from 5 to 10 x 10 nvt (E > 0. 18 MeV). The specimens will be examined for dimensional stability, gas permeability, and mechanical in irradiations in the DFR are essentially backup experiments to the HFIR irradiations.

The experimental program in the ORR consists of very closely controlled creep experiments to obtain quantitative creep coefficients. These data, although obtained at a very low exposure rate and thus low exposures, are essential for a stress analysis of the graphite bodies. These experiments will be very limited in scope in view of the base of existing information available on the creep behavior of graphite. The current experiment has been constructed and installed.

Studies were continued to develop methods for brazing large graphite pipes to Hastelloy N. Our current activities consist of work in the following areas: (1) development of a corrosion-resistant alloy which will readily wet and flow on graphite but which does not suffer from the transmutation problem associated with gold-containing alloys; and (2) devising techniques for the manufacture of graphite-to-Hastelloy-N assemblies of the size and configuration required.

A vacuum or inert-atmosphere induction brazing furnace for brazing graphite-to-metal assemblies up to 4 inches in diameter by 12 inches long has been designed and is currently under construction. Several pieces of graphite, molybdenum, and Hastelloy N have been prepared for brazing using the tapered-joint design reported previously. Figure 6. 17 shows the size and configuration of the components.

The microstructure of the brazed joint is shown again in Fig. 18 for reference purposes. Electron-probe microanalyses show that molybdenum diffused into the brazing alloy, as was deduced by Jones and Werner from its microstructure. There was some migration of nickel and palladium into the molybdenum, along with a slight amount of chromium.

The speckled precipitates in the brazing alloy are primarily Mo, Ni, Cr, and C in descending quantities. These are believed to be essentially mixed carbides of molybdenum and chromium.

The microstructures suggest that this is a well-formed joint that has not been appreciably altered by the corrosion exposure. A deposit is present on the surface of the braze metal. The deposit has been identified as pure palladium, except for some nickel in the region adjacent to the brazing alloy. While it extends slightly over the graphite, it seems to be attached only to.

Recently, we installed specimens in the hot leg of the stainless steel circuit so as to generate additional data on that system. It is of interest to compare the compatibility of the salt which has now reached maturity in the loop with earlier results. To date, the specimen in the hottest portion of the loop, 1250°F, has experienced weight losses as shown in Table 6. 5.

The failure of the aluminum blower blades at the MSRE site and the resultant damage were discussed in the last semiannual report. It was concluded that no damage was visually observed; however, the possibility that some undetected aluminum still might be in intimate contact with the Hastelloy N tubes did exist. An experiment was conducted to determine the effect of prolonged exposure to aluminum at 1200°F.

Heat exchangers were placed in intimate contact and held for times up to 1000 hours. The results of the 1000-hour exposure are shown in Fig. 20a. For comparative purposes, the 5-hour exposure is in photomicrographs. The Hastelloy N tubing has a wall thickness of approximately 5 inch. The penetration after 5 hours was about 16% and after the 1000-hour exposure, it had not increased.

The microstructure seen in the specimen held for 1000 hours is considerably different from that in the 5-hour sample. The extended exposure has allowed the various phases to grow and has resulted in a diffusion couple of aluminum-nickel, complicated somewhat by the presence of zinc and other minor elements.

More than half of the total power generated by the MSRE (21,464 MWh) was produced during the current report period. Heat balance and nuclear calculations indicate that a total of 1. 083 kg summarizes the results of fuel composition and purity analyses for the MSRE fuel in each of the power runs, including the three conducted in the last six months, Nos. 8 to 10, and the current run, No. 11. These data show that the uranium concentration of the fuel salt has decreased appreciably since power operation began. It should not be inferred, however, that burnup is evident in the results of chemical analysis for runs 4 to 10, for virtually all the decrease noted. Analytical values shown here have been adjusted to compensate for changes in the isotopic composition of uranium and for those periodic variations in analytical bias as determined by the Analytical Quality Control Group.

Step decreases in the inventory values reflect the dilution of the fuel salt by residues of flush salt remaining in the reactor fuel circuit after flushing operations are completed. Fuel salt is also removed from the fuel circuit by sampling procedures and by transfer of fuel to flush. Computation of this value has involved a number of assumptions, such as those concerned with the precision of uranium analyses in the 100-to-800-ppm concentration range, as well as the configuration and dimensions of MSRE fuel circuit components where salt residues may reside.

Since oxidative corrosion of the MSRE fuel circuit results in the formation of chromous fluoride, the concentration of chromium in the fuel salt serves as the principal indicator of the extent of generalized corrosion. The chromium content of the fuel salt has remained very low throughout the operating history of the MSRE. In the current report period, the chromium concentration of the salt has remained at 62 ± 5 ppm (Table 7.1), corresponding to a uniform removal of chromium from the walls of the reactor circuit from a maximum depth of about 0.1 mil.

Prior to the removal and replacement of the original metal and graphite surveillance specimens in August 1966, the average chromium concentration of the fuel salt was 48 ± 7 ppm (Table 7.1), a value which was attained during the first power operations with the reactor. All subsequent specimens of fuel salt analyzed.

Introduction of about 85 g of chromium into the fuel since October 1966. The increase in chromium concentration from 48 to 62 ppm may possibly be assignable to corrosion of the new surveillance assembly. If so, the corrosion sustained by the assembly must be greater than that previously experienced by the entire fuel circuit from December 1965 up to the present time.

The MSRE fuel salt contained a very low concentration of U-3 at the outset of power operations, with possibly a maximum of 0. 16% of the uranium (366 g, 1. 54 gram atoms) in the ust. Termination of MSRE run 7, fuel burnup had consumed 1.66 gram atoms of uranium. Just how much was produced, the fuel salt would have become slightly oxidizing by the end of run 7. No such conclusion is justified, however, from the results of chromium analyses. These results indicate rather that oxidation corrosion ceased before the MSRE had generated a total of 1 MWhr of power. Absence of corrosion in runs 4 to 7 should probably be attributed at the beginning to the presence of U and perhaps subsequently to the deposition of noble-metal fission product films. At the termination of run 7 (7800 MWhr), a uniform film formed by the deposition of all the Mo, Nb, and Ru produced would have a thickness of approximately 150 Å.

The current experiment with the MSRE is scheduled to be terminated at the end of 30,000 MWh of operation. At that time, the present surveillance specimens will be removed for inspection and testing. It will be of considerable value to learn whether the present assembly has sustained the amount of corrosion that has been observed in the fuel samples since last October.

Mixture to remove oxide, followed by sparging with hydrogen alone to complete the reduction of structural metal fluorides such as NF and FeF. During this final reduction step, a small portion of the UF4 should also have been reduced, the amount depending upon the duration of the.

Some fission products are far more oxidized than would seem compatible with the presence of significant amounts of UF6 in the MSRE fuel. Consequently, the data collected by Shaffer et al. during the purification of the fuel salt concentrate at the production facility recently has been.

In accord with this equation, plots of 1/Phe vs. V, based on data collected at 700°C during the purification of the various batches of fuel concentrate, were found to be linear. All plots could be fitted reasonably well with lines of slopes corresponding to Q ~ 0. 9 x 10^7 atm^-1/%. From the final value of P, knowing Q and P, the average amount of uranium reduction at the end of the hydrogen treatment was estimated to be 0. 16%.

A mole of uranium had been involved. This indicated that inadvertent exposure of the salt to oxidizing impurities such as water or oxygen had occurred during prior storage, during transfer of the sample to the reaction vessel, or in later handling. Since the presence of HF at this temperature in the amounts seen should have quickly oxidized the UF6 present, it was not possible to confirm the amount of UF6 initially present in the fuel concentrate. In two subsequent H2 sparging runs at 700°C; however, data were obtained which permitted improved estimates of Q from plots of 1/PR vs. V.

Salt production data: It is not reasonable to attribute this discrepancy entirely to the differences in temperature since, judging from Long's measurements of the temperature dependence of Q in LiF-BeF melts, more than a 30°C difference would be required. It seems more likely that the discrepancy is due partly to nonequilibrium sparging conditions in the production treatment. The present value of Q = 1. 8 x 10⁻⁵ atm⁻¹ determined for the fuel concentrate is somewhat lower than the value ~4 x 10⁻⁵ atm⁻¹, which may be estimated for the MSRE fuel salt at 700°C from Long's measurements.

Even though equilibrium conditions might not have prevailed during purification of the fuel concentrate, a 0. 16% reduction of UF6 remains a valid estimate since, in effect, it is based upon the integrated amount of HF evolved by reduction, which, in turn, is related by material balance to the amount of UF6 formed.

The fission product isotopes of molybdenum, niobium, technetium, ruthenium, and tellurium were expected to appear principally in their elemental forms in the MSRE system. While some might be carried as suspended metal or even in solution as moderately unstable fluorides of low valence state, they were "expected to precipitate, in large part, on the metallic portions of the reactor. Subsequently, three additions have been made by suspending.

Been observed in the cover gas in the MSRE pump bowl; substantial fractions of the fission prod graphite. The presence of these materials as gas-phase species suggested that the fuel salt contained, at the outset and until this year, much less uranium trifluoride than intended and very much less than is tolerable.

The result showed that the concentration of UF corresponded to less than 0.05% of the total uranium and probably to less than 0. 02%. The MSRE fuel salt was considered to be far more oxidizing than was necessary or desirable and certain to become more so as additional power was of small quantities of beryllium metal to the circulating salt. Initially, 4 g of beryllium was introduced into the fuel salt by melting a mixture of LiF-BeF, carrier salt, and powdered beryllium in.

Specimens of Yin. Beryllium rods in the salt in the pump bowl. The capsules used for adding beryllium were similar in size and construction to those used for sampling for oxide analysis but were penetrated with numerous holes to permit reasonable flow of fuel salt. The beryllium rods have reacted with the fuel salt at a steady rate, dissolving at approximately 1. 5 g/hr. To date, 27. 94 g of beryllium has been introduced into the MSRE fuel salt, a quantity corresponding to the conversion of 0. 65% of the U to U3.

The initial results of tests on the chemical behavior of fission products in the MSRE were reported previously, with descriptions of the experimental facilities used and a discussion of the objectives of this work. Most fission products behaved as expected, with the exception of the noble metals, which showed an unexpected tendency to volatilize and to deposit on metal surfaces and in graphite. This observation implies that the fuel salt was more oxidizing than expected.

Metal. The special pump bowl tests in this report period were mainly directed toward following the effect of beryllium additions on the volatilization and deposition behavior of the noble metals. Also completed in the period were the radiochemical analyses on the first set of long-term surveillance specimens of graphite and Hastelloy N exposed in the MSRE core.

The bulk of the radiochemical analyses were reported previously on the graphite and Hastelloy N specimens exposed in the MSRE core for 7800 Mwhr of power operation. Further analyses were made on selected graphite samples for Zr, Nb, Ce, and Cs to provide a more complete picture of the behavior of these isotopes. A few samples were also analyzed for Nd and Y because of the interest in rare-earth-type isotopes themselves, as well as in their rare-gas precursors. The new data are tabulated along with previous results on these elements. Seldom exceeded the 10% analytical error; the revised values will not be reported here.

The new data generally followed the indications from previous results. The flat profile of 95Zr in the interior of the middle graphite bar, at a level 100 times that of the blanks, suggests a slight volatility of zirconium, since 95Zr has no long-lived gaseous precursor. Some of the 95Nb in the interior may have arisen from the decay of 95Zr, but this correction is negligible for the first two surface samples. Even in the interior, the concentration of 95Nb in a given layer was always higher than that of 95Zr, whereas the reverse would have been true if most of the 95Nb had been formed in place from 95Zr. Thus, the observed high concentrations of 95Nb in the graphite may not be ascribed to precursor behavior.

The additional data on 144Ce, 144Ce, 91Y, and 147Nd confirmed the previous conclusion that the distribution of the rare earths and alkaline earths in graphite reflects the diffusion behavior of the precursor rare gas. The species with short-lived gaseous precursors showed steep concentration gradients; whereas those whose gaseous precursors had half-lives of several minutes showed relatively flat interior concentration profiles. A diffusion model has been developed which satisfactorily accounts for the observed distributions of the fission products with rare gas.

The very flat interior concentration profile of Cs in graphite was confirmed by the new results in Table 7.2. A distribution similar to that of Sr was expected on the basis of precursor behavior. The data suggest a mobility of Cs itself, in accord with the known volatility of elemental cesium over cesium carbide.

It is difficult to purify 99Tc from contaminating activities sufficiently well to provide an accurate count of this low-specific-activity isotope. The results indicated qualitatively amounts of 99Tc to be expected from the decay of the determined amounts of its parent 99Mo.

The nature of the distribution of various fission products in the graphite surveillance specimens is shown graphically in Fig. 7. 2. The lines are rough averages obtained by visually drawing smooth curves through individual points, often widely scattered, representing all of the available data. The steepness of the concentration gradients of the noble metals and the very different gradients of species with noble-gas precursors (iodine, Ba, and Sr) are strikingly apparent.

It is interesting to compare the deposition of uranium and molybdenum in the first layer of uranium per square centimeter. The average amount of Mo on the graphite surfaces at the time of reactor shutdown was 0. 039 pg of 90Mo per square centimeter. Assuming that Mo indicates the deposition behavior of the stable molybdenum fission products, there must have been nearly 2 µg of total molybdenum per square centimeter of graphite after 7800 MWhr of reactor operation.

The amounts of seven fission products deposited on top, middle, and bottom samples of Hastelloy N from the surveillance assembly were previously reported. In addition, the following values were documented: 3.79 x 10^3 dis min^-1 cm^-2 at the bottom, 3. If the niobium were distributed uniformly over the 1.2 x 10^3 cm of Hastelloy surface in the MSRE, these values correspond to 42, 43, and 90%, respectively, of the calculated total Nb present at reactor shutdown in the reactor system. Thus, on average, about half the Nb-95 produced was deposited on the reactor metal walls. A similar average for the deposition of Nb-95 on graphite was nearly half the total present. Correspondingly, analyses for Nb in recent fuel salt samples, after correction for Zr-95 decay since sampling, indicated that only a low fraction of the total present remained in the salt.

The Hastelloy N samples were also analyzed for Co, Mn, Co, and Fe. The thermal and fast fluxes calculated from these values agreed satisfactorily with values from the analysis of dosimeter wires included in the surveillance package. For Nb, as for the fission products previously reported, there was no correlation between flux and the amount deposited on Hastelloy N.

In the period of reactor operation covered by the seven tabulated samples, there were four reactor drains and a number of shutdowns, the longer of which lasted 83.5 days, 14.5 days, and days, on the concentrations of fission products. The activities were calculated back to the time of shutdown (July 17, 1966) and should thus be comparable with the results of sample FP7-12, taken a few days before the shutdown. The small rise in I concentration is attributed to a slight contamination of the sample, which would have a large apparent effect when multiplied by the large correction factor for decay for more than ten half-lives. There were, however, significant decreases by a factor of 4 in the concentrations of Ru, Ru, and Te, suggesting a slow deposition of these species on the metal walls of the drain tank. Similarly, the noble metal concentrations were lower in sample FP11-22, taken 3.2 days after shutdown, than in the previous sample FP11-12, taken during power operation. The other species increased in concentration due to the 16 days of power operation between the two samples.

It is challenging to conclude from the data in Table 7.6 that there was a significant effect of fuel reduction on the noble-metal concentrations in the fuel. The concentrations frequently rose rather than fell, as expected, after adding beryllium. It was interesting that the Mo, Ru, Rh, and Te showed parallel rises and falls. The Mo results were impossibly high for samples FP11-8 and FP11-12. The high values were checked by reruns on fresh samples. If all the Mo produced by fission remained uniformly distributed in the fuel, the calculated consequences.

The Nb concentrations in Table 7. 6 varied erratically and did not parallel the behavior of the other noble metals. This is ascribed to analytical difficulties, which are being further investigated. An unavoidable difficulty is that a large correction for Zr decay must be made for each salt analysis.

Showed approximately the expected yields in the salt phase within analytical error. It was reported previously that reactor power levels calculated from the observed concentrations of elements like strontium and cerium, which remain in the fuel phase, were consistently about 20% lower than the power levels calculated from coolant heat balances. This discrepancy has persisted in the analyses of the new fuel salt samples. To date, there have been several dozen radiochemical analyses, all of which indicate lower than nominal power levels.

Six pump bowl tests were run in this report period in which metal specimens were exposed to the gas phase and the fuel phase of the pump bowl for 10 min. The previous technique was modified slightly in that the coils of silver and Hastelloy N were attached beside the capsule cables rather than being wound on them. This facilitated sample disassembly in the hot cell and furnished an additional specimen of stainless steel cable in the gas phase.

The gross features of fission product behavior in these runs were similar to those reported previously, with heavy deposition of the noble-metal fission products on all specimens and light contamination by SrZr, rare earths, and alkaline earths. All the analytical data obtained will not be presented since the mass of detail would be confusing. However, to make clear the effect of the three beryllium additions, the depositions on the Hastelloy N specimens in the gas phase. The results on the other gas-phase specimens were generally qualitatively similar to those on the Hastelloy N samples.

It is seen from Table 7.7 that noble-metal volatilization usually increased after the first and third beryllium additions and decreased as expected only after the second addition. Nevertheless, the average deposition on the gas-phase specimens was slightly lower after the three additions than it had been previously. Much larger decreases in volatilization followed reactor shutdown. Experiment FP8-5 was run just before power operation was resumed after an 83.5-day shutdown, and FP11-12 after a 3.2-day shutdown. In each case, activities were calculated back to the time of shutdown.

As in previous runs, it was observed that deposition on the four different metal specimens was of similar magnitude for all species. Less reaction of noble-metal fluorides with silver in particular was expected since AgF is relatively unstable. In experiment FP11-22, a gold wire coil was substituted for the silver one, and it picked up as much of the noble metals as the other metal specimens. This lack of chemical discrimination is puzzling and casts some doubt on the supposition that the noble-metal fission products leave the fuel phase as high-valent fluorides.

Insertion into the pump bowl. These observations of deposition indicate the value of laboratory experiments to identify the chemical nature of the noble-metal species that volatilize from radioactive fuel salt. Such experiments appear to be feasible using either mass spectrometric or gas chromatography.

The data in Table 7.8 show that the average deposition of noble metals was heavier on the stainless steel cable immersed in fuel than on Hastelloy N in the gas phase, although contamination by salt, as indicated by Zr, Ba, etc. , was no greater. It was interesting that the plating behavior generally paralleled the volatilization behavior. Thus, on average, the amount of noble metals plated decreased after the second beryllium addition but increased after the first and third additions, as did deposition on the gas-phase specimens. Also, the amount plated was distinctly lower in the two runs made after reactor shutdown. This parallelism is consistent with the theory that high-valent noble-metal species in the fuel take part in both the plating and volatilization processes.

Because of the practical interest in the behavior of the molybdenum and 90Tc fission products, the results of these pump bowl tests for 90Mo are given in detail in Table 7. 9. The questionable effect of fuel reduction and the definite effect of reactor shutdown are shown clearly.

The nickel specimen probably accounts for the larger total amount deposited. The heavy deposit on the key suggests the truly gaseous nature of the 99M species since the key is surrounded by the latch, and only its bottom tip projects into the pump bowl space. The qualitative nature of previous data is not supported by the behavior of the other noble metals. Individual values are probably reproducible only within a factor of about 4. On this basis, only sizable changes in deposition, such as between the last two runs, are to be considered significant.

Also recorded in Tables 7.7 and 7.8 are the quantities of 35U determined by delayed-neutron counting in the leaches of the metal specimens exposed in the MSRE pump bowl. The reported results varied from 0.4 to 24 pg of 5U per sample. Of the total of 25 samples run, only five exceeded 5 yg of 95U, with the remainder averaging 2 pg of 35U. No correlation was apparent between the deposition of uranium and that of fission products; thus, the uranium found did not merely represent contamination of the samples by fuel salt. It is not surprising that uranium shows different chemical behavior from the noble metals. What is difficult to explain chemically is that it volatilizes or plates at all. Fortunately, the extent of uranium volatilization and plating is small (as shown more conclusively in the examination of the long-term surveillance specimens) and is of negligible practical concern.

Although valuable qualitative information was derived from the tests in which metal specimens were exposed in the pump bowl, these tests suffered from the drawback that the results could not be interpreted quantitatively. Therefore, a capsule was designed to take a pump bowl gas sample.

Salt-sampling pipe is positioned with the bottom of the capsule 1 in. above the fuel salt level for 10 min. The freeze seal melts at the 600°C pump bowl temperature, and pump bowl gas fills the 20-cc volume. The capsule is then withdrawn to 2 ft above the pump bowl, and the capsule is allowed to cool. There is a slight “breathing action of the capsule when the initial sample is partially exhaled as the capsule warms from the Li 2BeF2 liquidus temperature (457°C) to 600°C. As the capsule cools from 600 to 457°C in the sampling pipe, additional gas is drawn into the capsule. The double freeze seal prevents loss of the salt seal during the exhalation.

It is thought that the reactive fission product gases first inhaled react rapidly with the interior metal (nickel or stainless steel) walls of the capsule, so that correction need not be made for loss during exhalation. The final inhalation is 2 ft up the pipe where the atmosphere should be relatively pure helium.

The cooled resealed capsule is withdrawn from the sampling pipe and transported in a carrier to the analytical hot cells. Here, a Teflon plug is placed over the protruding capillary, and the exterior of the capsule is thoroughly leached free of fission product activities. The top of the capsule is cut off, and the interior metal surface is leached with basic and acid solutions for 1 hr. The four capsule pieces are placed in a beaker and thoroughly leached with 8 M HNO3 until the.

Table 7.10 gives the total activities in the leach solutions for the freeze valve capsule runs made before and after the first 5.5-g beryllium addition to the fuel. The runs made after the next two beryllium additions failed since the capsules were lowered a little too far into the pump bowl and withdrew salt samples. In the two successful runs, the final leach of the segmented capsule contained about nine-tenths of the total of each of the activities. The activities either were trapped by the sealing salt or reacted very rapidly with the walls of the bottom chamber or the.

The results of Table 7.10 generally confirmed the qualitative indications from the pump bowl tests. For comparison, Table 7.10 includes the analysis of fuel salt sample FP10-20, which was taken between the two freeze valve capsule runs. It is seen that the 20-cc gas samples contained more 90Mo, 133Ru, 131Ru, and 135Te than were contained per gram of fuel salt. The slight decrease in most of these activities after adding 5.5 g of beryllium is probably within analytical error. The 90Nb activities were relatively low and may reflect the analytical difficulties with this isotope. On the other hand, the 105Zr and 130Ba activities were very low, indicating that less than 0.5 mg of fuel salt had entered the capsules. The quantities of 105U found were low, but higher than expected. Although 0.5 mg of fuel salt would more than account for the amount of 2350 found, this explanation is difficult to accept since the values for 95Zr and 140Ba were lower in the sample for which the 5U value was higher. Tentatively, the 235U values are taken as representing volatilization of uranium. The sharp drop in the uranium value after adding 5.5 g of beryllium.

Another special capsule has been designed for exposing graphite specimens to both the fuel phase and the gas phase of the MSRE pump bowl. This test will permit the evaluation of noble metal deposition on graphite under various specific short-term operating conditions.

Additional qualitative pump bowl tests and new quantitative freeze valve capsule tests have confirmed the previously reported tendency of the noble-metal fission products to leave the fuel by volatilization and by plating on Hastelloy N. The observed behavior was difficult to interpret thermodynamically, as discussed previously. These difficulties were compounded by the currently reported observations that uranium also volatilized and that the behavior of noble metals was not.

In order to retain the volatile fluoride hypothesis, recourse must be had to kinetic explanations. It may be postulated that sizable steady-state stoichiometrically equivalent concentrations of U5 and U3 are produced radiolytically in the fuel melt. This postulate implies that the oxidized and reduced species do not undergo back reaction fast enough for their concentrations to fall to very low values. In the radiolysis of water at high temperatures, steady-state concentrations of H and O are produced and maintained analogously. Now the U5 can oxidize the noble-metal fission products to high-valent volatile states. Bubbles of helium known to be circulating with the salt can act as kinetic traps to preserve the oxidized species from reaction with U3. The probability of reduction is much poorer in the dilute gas phase. The oxidized fluorides may, in this way, be delivered to the pump bowl and swept out.

A difficulty with this theory, aside from its several assumptions, is that noble-metal volatilization was nearly as great three days and 83. 5 days after reactor shutdown (Table 7.7) as during reactor operation; whereas, the radioactivity of the fuel melt and consequently its rate of radiolysis had changed by several orders of magnitude. A very strong dependence of the rate of back reaction of U3 and U5 on their concentrations would be required to reconcile this fact.

An alternate theory postulates that the noble metals circulate as metal sols in the fuel melt. Since the fuel melt does not wet clean metals, the sol would tend to accumulate at the interfaces of the fuel with the gas phase, such as helium bubbles. When the helium bubbles go through the spray ring and burst, some of the metal sol may be sprayed into the gas phase as a gaseous suspension, which would act like a volatile species.

The reduction of the fuel melt by adding beryllium metal will be continued until at least 1% of the U4 has been converted to U3. This additional reduction may have some effect on noble metal volatilization. The addition of a little hydrogen to the helium cover gas may be effective.

Of interest to fuel reprocessing studies for the reference design MSBR and whose solubilities in the proposed MSBR fuel solvent have not been previously measured. The solubility of SmF2 in LiF-BeF2 (66-34 mole %) was determined for comparison with previous data in a similar fluoride solvent and with anticipated measurements of SmF2 solubilities in the same solvent.

The experimental method essentially duplicated that of the earlier investigation, filtering and cooling the molten mixture between 550 and 800°C. Rare-earth concentrations in the filtered samples were determined by radiochemical techniques. In the current study, rare earths were labeled in situ with an appropriate radioisotope at temperatures in excess of that required for complete dissolution of the added rare-earth fluoride. Earlier studies incorporated the radiotracer during the preparation of the rare-earth trifluoride.

Experimental values of the solubility of SmF2 in LiF-BeF2 (66-34 mole %) at 600, 700, and a solution of 10.5 kcal/mole for SnF2, and 11.5 kcal/mole for NdF3, were calculated from the linear dependence of the logarithm of the solubility values on the reciprocal of the absolute temperature.

To qualify as the best blanket salts from phase behavior considerations, the ThF4 concentration of these mixtures varies from 6.5 to 29 mole% as LiF concentrations change from 63 to 71 mole%. Liquidus temperatures for this range of compositions vary from 448°C (838°F) to 568°C (1044°F). In the molten state, these mixtures contain thorium concentrations ranging. If 2000 g/liter of thorium is adequate to achieve good breeding gain, the composition containing 17. 5 mole% ThF4 may be used, and the liquidus temperature of this mixture is 516°C (960°F).

Products on a bed of solid UF, as a possible method for reprocessing the fuel solvent of the reference design MSBR. Experiments conducted thus far have examined the removal of selected rare earths from the simulated fuel solvent upon addition of solid UF. Results obtained for the removal of NdF3 are illustrated in Figure 10. Material balance calculations of the system indicate that the composition of the solid phase varied from 0.54 to 0.22 mole % NdF3 in UF, as UF3 was added to the salt mixture. Subsequent changes in the concentration of NdF3 and UF3 in the salt mixture, as the temperature was varied from 550 to 800°C, corresponded to a constant solid.

By reduction with thorium-bismuth amalgams has continued. In an experiment at 650°C in which the salt originally contained about 600 ppm UF, and a trace of PaF2, thorium was added to the bismuth in several successive small increments, and after equilibration, the concentrations of Li.

The standard half-cell potential E_y of a metal is typically defined for the reaction M = M^2+ + 2e^−, where M represents the pure metal in the suitable physical state at the given temperature, and M^2+ is the ion in solution relative to a standard state. Baes has compiled E_y values for various elements, utilizing a hypothetical unit mole fraction solution in the MSBR fuel solvent as the standard state of the ion (extrapolated from dilute solution), except for Li and Be, where the standard state is the Li,BeF mixture. These tabulated values are specific to the Li,BeF fuel salt but are considered a reasonable estimate for the Li-Th-Be blanket salt. Any adjustments in the ion concentration within the salt can be addressed by appropriate modifications.

Highly electropositive metals dissolved in bismuth do not form ideal solutions at all. Even at low concentrations, these are intermetallic compounds formed with substantial free energies. Nevertheless, preserving the form of Eq. (2), we can write.

And substituting this into (3), we obtain (1). We see at once that i is the voltage of the half-cell when X = X. Here, the standard states or hypothetical unit mole fraction solutions have the properties corresponding to infinite dilution. To evaluate the Ets, we need to know Ey and y_/y for one of the four metals and just the ratio XX for the others. This will enable us to construct an electromotive series for the system amalgam-salt, which will include protactinium, for which we do not know y or gy. It should be stressed that y and g are alternate ways of accounting for the same phenomenon, the formation of intermetallic compounds with bismuth.

Interpolation of values obtained at Brookhaven gives y for Th and U as 107 and 1.7 x 10^7 respectively. An error of an order of magnitude in y/y for Li gives four orders of error in y for Th and U; so considering the approximations in the calculations, the agreement is reasonable. On the other hand, et changes by the same amount for all valences, so that the difference in et, which is the quantity most directly related to the extraction efficiency, is not affected by errors in y. Therefore, although the absolute values should not be taken too seriously, they indicate fairly well the relative ease of extraction of the four elements into bismuth.

As part of the program of removing lanthanide fission products from MSBR fuel solvent by reductive extraction into liquid metal, the study of the activity of lithium in bismuth amalgams has been continued. The method used has been the equilibration of amalgam-salt systems with metallic beryllium, which is insoluble in bismuth and thus has a known unit activity. An analysis of data reported earlier reveals that, regardless of whether the amalgam was prepared by adding Li or Be to the bismuth-salt system, only about two-thirds of the reductant metal appeared as amalgamated lithium. Because of the difficulty in accurately measuring very small changes in salt composition, mass balances were made on the basis of the metal phase only, so that it was not possible to tell whether the missing one-third was due to some systematic experimental error or represented an actual reduction process.

The use of barium as a reductant has allowed both salt and metal phases to be analyzed accurately. In this experiment, Ba was added on top of the salt, through which it sank and dissolved in the bismuth. A similar procedure had been used for Be (which floats; however), while Li had been added through a dip leg directly to the bismuth. Here again, it was found that only about 60% of the Ba could be accounted for by Ba and Li in the bismuth. Now, however, the lost barium all appeared in the salt phase, with the mass balance generally 95 to 105%. It is clear, therefore, that some unexpected reduction process was going on.

The only reducible material present in sufficient quantities to explain this behavior is beryllium ion. Excluding, for the present, the possibilities of Be and Be dissolved in the salt; metallic beryllium can be present only at unit activity. Thus, at equilibrium, a lithium amalgam mole fraction of about 0. 18 can be reached before any beryllium is formed, while a Ba amalgam should not reduce Be at all. However, one can imagine the formation of Be either by the metallic Ba sinking through the salt or by Li amalgam at locally high concentration before it is thoroughly mixed. If, then, any Be so formed, or Be introduced as such, should be physically disposed in such a way that it no longer can be made to contact the bismuth by agitation; it will never come to a true equilibrium. For instance, since Be floats, it may splash onto the container walls and not drain back. At least, it can be shown that the amount of lost reductant is roughly proportional to the amount added, which would be expected if this is the case. Unfortunately, some other old work, in which when salt was contacted with an already equilibrated amalgam, more Li disappeared, is still not explained.

Data given in the previous progress report showed that a large fraction of the protactinium dissolved in molten LiF-ThF4 (73-27 mole %) is converted by exposure to solid thorium to a form that does not pass through a sintered copper filter. However, more than half of the reduced protactinium remained suspended in the molten salt. It was also reported that efforts to convert the dissolved protactinium into a more readily recoverable form by electrolytic reduction had been unsuccessful. Further studies of the reduction process and other potential recovery methods are briefly summarized here.

In a niobium-lined nickel pot equipped with a niobium dip leg, the 9Pa, 94Pa (in irradiated treatment with mixed HF and H). After adding bismuth metal to the molten salt, the salt phase was exposed to a freshly cleaned thorium rod, approximately % in diameter, for three consecutive 45-min periods. After the third exposure, the protactinium concentration had been reduced to about 12% of the initial value.

The crusts collected from the three thorium rods used in this experiment (13.0 g total) contained approximately 6.5 g of bismuth, far more than could be accounted for by the change in bismuth content of the filtered samples. The bismuth recovered as a separate phase weighed 51 g, as compared with the calculated value of 89 g. Further experimentation will be required to provide a satisfactory explanation of these observations.

Thorium Reduction in the Presence of Iron Surface (Brillo Process) Shaffer reported that when a tracer quantity of 7% Pa precipitated from molten LiF-BeF in THF (73-2-25 mole %) in the presence of a large amount of iron surface in the form of steel wool (Brillo), most of the 7% Pa activity remained with the steel wool when the salt drained away. We have performed a series of experiments that confirm Shaffer's finding with 31Pa concentrations in the approximate range 30.

The experiments were performed in three steps. A weighed quantity of previously purified LiF-ThF (73-27 mole %) was mixed with 231 g and 733 Pa in a nickel vessel, treated with a mix. A weighed amount of grade 00 steel wool (0. 068 m/g surface area) was placed in a mild steel liner, which was enclosed in a welded nickel vessel equipped with a stainless steel dip leg. A stream of purified hydrogen flowed through the vessel while it was heated to 800 to 820°C for about 4 hours and then cooled in flowing helium. The dip legs of the two vessels were then connected by a short transfer line and heated to about 650°C. Helium pressure applied to the salt vessel transferred the salt to the steel-lined vessel, and helium continued to flow through both vessels to provide mixing of the molten salt. A thorium rod, attached to a Ygein nickel rod, was inserted in the salt with its lower end about % in above the bed of steel wool. After the thorium was exposed in the salt for the desired length of time, it was withdrawn, and a filtered sample of the salt was obtained with a sintered copper filter stick. This procedure was repeated, usually with a clean thorium rod, until a gross gamma count of 233Pa in the filtered sample showed that most of the protactinium had been removed from solution. The vessel connections were then reversed to transfer the salt back to the nickel vessel.

Removed and weighed. This material was crushed and, in some experiments, separated into magnetic and nonmagnetic fractions by use of a small magnet. A sample of the unfiltered salt in the nickel vessel was also removed for analysis. Alpha pulse-height analysis was used to determine the 31Pa content of all samples.

We found that thorium exposure of 1.5 to 2.2 hours reduced 95 to 99% of the protactinium to a form that would not pass through the sintered copper filter medium. A surprisingly large amount of iron was found in the filtered salt samples before the salt was exposed to the steel wool. The source of this iron has not been determined, but analysis of the filtered samples indicated that, in general, the iron content of the salt decreased as the protactinium was reduced by exposure to thorium. We performed a pair of experiments to test this theory in which we attempted to hold all the variables constant except the iron/protactinium ratio. Additional experiments will be required to establish the important variables in the Brillo protactinium recovery process and to explore modifications that would make it more readily adaptable to a large-scale process.

We are currently conducting experiments with 59Fe tracer in an effort to establish the role of dissolved or colloidal iron in the retention of reduced protactinium by steel wool and to test the reliability of the currently used analytical procedure for the determination of iron in fluoride samples.

The results of our efforts to transfer protactinium from a molten breeder blanket mixture to liquid bismuth, either by electrolytic reduction or by exposure of the salt to thorium metal, have not been favorable in the small-scale glove-box experiments conducted to date. Nevertheless, the encouraging results obtained in tracer-level experiments with protactinium and rare earths suggest that continued studies are desirable.

In the protactinium recovery studies described in the preceding section of this report, it has been generally assumed that protactinium is present in the LiF-ThF2 (73 mole % LiF) melts as PaF4. This assumption has seemed plausible since the melts have, in every case, received a treatment with H2 at temperatures near 650°C, and H2 is known to reduce pure PaF4 to PaF3 at much lower temperatures. (The Pa state seems to be the lowest known in fluoride systems. ) We have, however, conducted a few preliminary experiments to test this assumption and to see if the phase behavior of PaF4 is similar to that of ThF4 in mixtures with LiF.

About 100 mg of 231Pa was prepared by evaporating a measured portion of a purified stock solution (CM in HF) to dryness in platinum and heating the residue to 600°C in a flowing HF-H2 mixture. Conversion to PaF4 was confirmed by weight and by the brown color of the material.

Examination of the slowly cooled melts showed that segregation of PaF-rich phases from the bulk of the LiF-ThF material occurred in both cases. Material from the mixture with 68 mole% LiF is believed to be a solid solution of LiPaF in LiThF. It is obvious that the study of the binary LiF-PaF system is needed before attempting further deductions concerning phase relations in the ternary system LiF-ThF-PaF.

A portion of the LiF-ThF, -PaF, mixture with 73 mole % LiF was transferred to a small thorium crucible and heated to 650°C in a helium atmosphere. Examination of the material with the polarizing microscope revealed some Li, ThF2, but a large part of the mixture was in the form of opaque angular fragments, which are probably protactinium metal. X-ray examination will be required to confirm this conclusion.

The abrupt decrease in concentration between samples FP-7-16 and FP-8-7 coincided with the change from copper to nickel sampling ladles and may reflect an oxide blank of about 15 ppm. The overall standard deviation of these results, 8 ppm absolute, includes any variation in the oxide content of the fuel in the reactor and in oxide contamination during sampling and transfer. The results of standardization with SnO samples performed during this period indicate that the precision of measurement of the water evolved by hydrofluorination is about 3 to 4 ppm absolute.

During the last week of December, the oxide apparatus became inoperative. Because of hydrogen reduction experiments being performed in the same hot cell, it was not possible to enter the cell and investigate the equipment until early February. It was found that the electrolytic moisture monitor cell was not functioning, and it was removed from the apparatus. With the current MSRE sampling schedules, it should be possible to install a new cell with an improved coating and resume oxide determinations of radioactive salt samples during the month of March.

This replacement will be the first major maintenance required for the hot-cell apparatus since its installation in February 1966. The moisture monitor cell had been in operation for several additional months during laboratory tests of the apparatus.

During the period when the hot-cell equipment was inoperable, the oxide development apparatus in Building 4500S was reactivated. Several samples of nonradioactive fuel and solvent salt from the second ORR molten-salt loop were analyzed for oxide content. The results of these analyses are summarized in Table 7. 13.

A proposed explanation of the unexpected distribution of certain fission products in the MSRE system is that the fuel had become sufficiently oxidizing to produce significant partial pressures of volatile fission product fluorides such as MoF2, TeF4, and RuF3, which then migrated into the graphite and the blanket gas. Because the accumulation of fission products in graphite is vitally important to breeder reactors, a method for the determination of U235/U238 ratios in the radioactive fuel samples was needed.

The possibility that a significant fraction of the iron and nickel is present in the fuel as colloidal metal particles precluded any adaptation of the hydrogen evolution method for U3 because these metallic components would also yield hydrogen on acidic dissolution. An alternate approach, suggested by C. F. Baes, is based on a transpiration method in which a sample of the molten fuel is sparged with hydrogen to reduce oxidized species according to the reaction.

Some components of the oxide apparatus were adapted for the transpiration measurement on radioactive fuel samples. The inlet of a modified hydrofluorinator is connected to a source of thoroughly dried hydrogen and helium, and the outlet is connected to a heated manifold fitted with six liquid nitrogen-cooled NaF traps. This arrangement permits the collection of the HF from four successive reduction steps with hydrogen and two blank spargings with helium on the same 50-g fuel sample. When the transpiration run is completed, the traps are disconnected from the manifold and removed from the hot cell for desorption and titration of the collected HF.

A computer program is being developed by the Mathematics Division to calculate HF yields for any preselected reduction steps on any melt composition. This will permit optimization of reduction steps for the best distinction of U° +/U4 ratios. In the absence of such a program, it was possible to select four reduction steps based on the criteria that the first two steps at 496°C would reduce at least 99. 9% of the Fe and Ni2 without materially affecting the U concentration and that the last two steps at 596°C would reduce U without reducing Cr+. The latter reductions thus serve as an indication of the oxidation state of the fuel. Hydrogen fluoride yields from sample FP-9-4 and from various hypothetical initial fuel compositions are plotted in Fig. 13. Broken lines connect calculated yield points, and a solid line connects the experimentally measured HF yields from the sample. The relatively low yields of HF in the first two steps are in agreement with earlier experimental evidence that only a small fraction of the iron and nickel is present. In the addition of sufficient beryllium metal to increase the U/U4 ratio by 0. 0037 was analyzed similarly, and the HF yield at step III corresponded to an approximate U2/U4+ ratio of 0. 005. This represents an increase of 0. 004 to 0. 005 over sample FP-9-4, in reasonable agreement with that calculated from the beryllium reduction.

A sample (IPSL-21) taken from the second ORR molten-salt loop has also been analyzed and found to contain about 1% of the uranium as U3+. Because the composition of this sample is in the region in which Cr is also reduced, a more accurate estimation of U3/U4 ratios must be deferred until the computer program is available.

Although tentative analyses by this technique are being reported, it should be recognized that the method is still in the developmental state, and adjustment of the reported values may be necessary as experience is gained. The agreement in the observed increase in U/S ratios with that predicted from the beryllium addition supports the validity of the method. Preliminary calculations indicate that it may be possible to apply the method to continuous in-line analysis of the fuel for the determination of both U/S ratios and significant ionic concentrations of corrosion.

This study was initiated to evaluate, by potentiometric measurements on concentration-type cells, several metal-metal-ion couples for use as possible reference electrodes in molten fluorides.

The apparatus used to contain the melt is a small vacuum dry box (24 in. long, 20 in. deep, and 15 in. high), which is outfitted with a furnace, vacuum, and controlled atmosphere facilities, and a moisture monitor. Utmost care is exercised to protect the molten fluorides from moisture contamination because of the affinity of the molten fluorides to moisture and the resultant precipitation of oxides. The melt (~400 ml) is contained in a graphite cell, a spiral nickel electrode, platinum stirrer, Pt-10% Rh thermocouple, and the inner electrode compartment are positioned in the melt. The inner compartment of the cell consists of a thin-walled boron nitride compartment which contains the same fluoride melt and a fixed concentration of dissolved NiF2. A nickel electrode is inserted into this compartment. Hot-pressed boron nitride is an insulator in molten fluorides but is slowly penetrated by them. As a result of this effect, BN can be utilized to separate the two half-cells and yet achieve electrical contact because such contact is made when thickness occurs within a day or so. However, it is much slower for LiF-BeF2-ZrF4 melts. Approximately a week is required for the resistance through the BN to drop to ~1000 ohms or less.

Additional observations were made of the anodic wave at ~ +1.4 V vs a platinum quasi-reference electrode in fluoride melts that contain U+. It is tentatively postulated that the wave is due to the anodic oxidation of U to U. The reduction of U4 to U3 is observed at approximately −1. 2 V. For simple charge-transfer processes, the wave heights for the two electrode reactions should be the same for the same rate of voltage scan. The anodic wave, however, is larger than the cathodic wave when a platinum—10% rhodium electrode is used. This suggests that the anodic wave may be a charge transfer followed by a catalytic reaction, that is, disproportionation of U. The observations, however, were not the same when the waves were recorded at a Pt—40% Rh electrode. At this electrode, the anodic and cathodic wave heights were about the same. Also, the possibility that the products of the electrode reaction (U5, US, etc. ) are attacking the electrode should not be overlooked. These studies are continuing, and it is planned to test others.

The determination of changes in the ppm concentration level of U3 in molten fluoride fuel is being investigated in LiF-BeF melts, which contain 2% w/w U. Such studies are carried out in a nickel captive-liquid cell that was modified to include a three-electrode voltametric system. The cell is designed so that spectrophotometric measurements can be made in the immediate region of the indicator electrode during the time that a redox reaction is occurring.

The cell holds about 1 mL of molten fluoride salt solution. A preliminary description of the cell and its operation has been published. The results obtained have demonstrated that changes of 50 ppm in the U concentration could be easily seen in a 1-cm path length of molten salt which contains 2% w/w U and up to ca. 500 ppm U3. This does not imply that the method would not work at higher concentration levels of U3; rather, this is the highest concentration level that was observed. Experiments using Z1F or ThF have been carried out using the very sensitive U4 absorption peak at 235 nm. Transparency of fluoride solvents in the region around 235 nm is a necessary requirement for this type of determination. Moderate absorbance has been observed in the region of 235 nm in LiF-BeF melts which contain ca. 10% w/w ThF. It is believed, however, that this absorbance is caused by a contaminant in the ThF4 that was added.

The study of the spectra of solute species that might interfere with the proposed spectrophotometric determination of U3+ in molten fluoride salts was continued. The spectra of several trivalent rare-earth ions in molten LiF-BeF2 at 550°C were recorded. Although Er3+ and Sm3+ exhibit absorption peaks at 377 nm and 400 nm, respectively, in the vicinity of the U3+ absorption at 360 nm, the molar absorptivity of these absorptions is under 10, and no interference would be expected. The spectrum of Ho3+ in LiF-BeF2 was also obtained. This solute species likewise exhibits relatively weak absorbance; the molar absorptivity of its most intense absorption peak, 452 nm, is less than 10. All of the absorption peaks observed for these three rare-earth ions, over the wavelength range of 250 to 2000 nm, are transitions within the f orbitals and would be expected to be relatively weak.

The remote apparatus for determining the oxide content of MSRE salt samples was modified to permit measurement of the oxidation state of 50-g fuel samples. The method is based on the molten sample with hydrogen. The liberated HF is collected on NaF traps cooled by liquid nitrogen. After the HF from the hydrogenation steps is collected, the traps are removed from the hot cell, and the HF is desorbed at 300°C and titrated. The oxidation-state measurements were made in conjunction with beryllium additions to the MSRE fuel salt. To date, three samples have been.

For the past two years, beryllium determinations made on radioactive MSRE fuel-salt samples have exhibited a 2% positive bias from book values. In an attempt to locate the source of the bias, six highly purified LiF-BeF2 samples were submitted to the High-Radiation-Level Analytical Laboratory; three of the samples were fused at 700°C to simulate the conditions of the fuel salt.

Irradiation of the first molten-salt convection loop experiment in the Oak Ridge Research Reactor beam hole HN-1 was terminated on August 8, 1966, after the development of 1.1 x 10³ fissions/cc. Fuel power densities up to 105 W per cc of salt were attained in the fuel channels of the core.

Successful operation of the major heating, cooling, temperature control, and sampling systems was demonstrated; however, leaks developed in two of the four cooling systems. The experiment was terminated after radioactivity was detected in the secondary containment system as a result of fuel leakage from a break in the sample line near the loop.

Irradiation of a second loop, modified to eliminate causes of failures encountered in the first, was begun in January 1967. Fueled operation began on January 30, 1967. Operation is continuing at an average core fuel power density estimated at 160 W per cc of salt.

The loop is designed to irradiate a representative molten-salt fuel circulating in contact with graphite and Hastelloy N at typical temperature differences and at a core power density of 200 W/cc. In particular, it allows us to study the interaction of fission products with graphite, metal, and fuel and gas phases, and the chemistry of the fuel salt at high levels of burnup. Provisions for sampling and replacement of both gas and salt permit conditions in the loop to be determined and to be altered during operation.

The core of the first loop consisted of a 2-inch-diameter by 6-inch-long cylinder of graphite obtained from the core shell, which were fabricated of Hastelloy N. The heaters and the cooling tubes in the core and return line were embedded in sprayed-on nickel, as was the 12-foot sample tube leading from the loop to the sample station in the equipment chamber at the ORR shield face.

The loop was operated with MSRE solvent salt for 187 hours at Y-12, and several salt samples were taken. It was inserted in beam hole HN-1 of the ORR on June 9, 1966, and operated for 1100 hours with solvent salt. During this period, the equipment was calibrated and tested, and its performance was evaluated. The loop was advanced to the position nearest the reactor lattice on July 21, and water injection into the air streams to the tubular core coolers and the jacket around the gas.

On July 27, after sampling, eutectic LiF-UF4 (23% enriched) fuel salt was added to develop a uranium concentration of 1.36 mol%. At this time, a capillary tube in the sample removal system broke, precluding further sampling. An associated in-leakage of air impelled solvent salt to a cold spot in the gas sample line, thereby plugging it.

During subsequent operation, the fission heating rate was determined. Water was released into the loop container during this period from what proved to be a leak in the cooling jacket around the salt, and the loop was retracted to 2% flux. It was removed to hot cells for disassembly and examination on August 11, 1966.

Samples of solvent salt taken prior to irradiation and after 1100 hr in-pile, and of irradiated fueled salt obtained after dismantling, were analyzed chemically and radiochemically. A sample of salt found between the metal core shell and the graphite was also analyzed.

The level of corrosion products, particularly chromium and nickel, in the salt increased in the successive samples. This was possibly due to the uptake of moisture by the solvent salt prior to loading, with consequent corrosion of the Hastelloy N.

Cesium-137 (41%) and Strontium-90 (42%), both with noble-gas precursors of ~3 min half-life, were still lower and could thereby have been lost to the gas space or graphite voids. Tellurium-127 was present in 10% of the amount produced in the salt. Ruthenium-103 and -106, which were expected to deposit on Hastelloy N surfaces, were not detected (<0. 03%) in the salt.

Nuclear heat was measured at various loop insertion positions by comparing electrical heat requirements under similar conditions with the reactor at zero and at full power. Reactor gamma heat with the loop fully inserted was 2900 W (with unfueled salt). With fuel containing 1. 36 mole% uranium (93% enriched), fission heat in the fully inserted position was 5800 W. The corresponding overall average fission heat density was 80 W per cc of salt at 650°C, and in the graphite core, the average fission heat density was 105 W per cc of fuel salt.

The cooling jacket on the gas separation tank leaked at a weld. The fuel leak resulted from a non-ductile break in the Hastelloy N sample line tubing near the attachment to the core bottom. The sprayed nickel was also cracked in this region.

Fuel salt in the form of a scale a few mils thick was found on the interior of the core shell, between it and the closely fitting graphite core. The analysis in Table 8.1 indicates that the scale is a mixture of fuel salt and Hastelloy N (probably metal debris from cut-up operation).

The heat removal rate of the loop coolers was entirely adequate to remove the 8.8 kW of fission and gamma heat, even after the loss (described earlier) of one of the two cooling coils around the loop core section. The air plus water injection technique appears adequate and responsive.

The response of the heating and cooling systems to rapid changes in the nuclear heat could be tested only under full fission conditions in-pile. Since this was regarded as important, reactor setback tests were conducted. Temperature control system response was adequate to maintain the salt molten during a reactor setback with a resultant loss of 8.8 kW of nuclear heat and to return the loop to normal operating conditions during a rapid (11-min) return to full power.

The sampling and addition system and operating procedures were adequate to permit several additions and removals of molten salt while operating the loop in-pile and to transport shielded samples under an inert gas atmosphere to the analytical laboratory.

Convective salt circulation, at rates of 5 to 10 cc/min, was achieved by causing the return line to operate at temperatures below the core temperature. Flow stoppages occurred from time to time. These were attributed to bubble formation resulting from different solubility of the argon cover gas at the varied temperatures around the loop. Salt flow was reestablished by evacuation and readdition of cover gas. Loss of flow had no adverse effect on loop operation.

A second in-pile molten-salt convection loop, essentially identical to the first convection loop experiment, was constructed, and in-pile irradiation began early in January 1967.

The coolant tubes embedded in sprayed-on nickel around the core section are now in good condition. On the first loop, the stainless steel tubing should have been entirely adequate for the service, and no reason for the failure observed has been uncovered. However, Inconel is the preferred material for exposure to the high-temperature steam-air mixture (around 400°C) generated when air-water mixtures are used as coolant. Since the rupture of one of the core coolant tubes occurred adjacent to a point where the tube was tack-welded to the core wall, the tack weld was eliminated in favor of a mechanical strap attachment. An expansion loop to relieve stresses has also been included in each of the signs of difficulty. Thermal cycling occurs during a reactor setback and startup, and it is estimated that no more than about 20 such thermal cycles will occur during a year of operation.

The salt transfer system appears to have resulted from excessive mechanical stress. Consequently, the wall thickness of this line has been increased to 0. 050 in, and additional mechanical support has been added such that there is now no part of the salt sample line which is unsupported — contrary to the case in the first loop assembly.

It was concluded that loss of circulation was caused by gas accumulation in the top of the core section. Accordingly, the salt flow channels at the top and bottom of the eight Yin holes for salt, the vertical holes.

The loop was placed under irradiation in beam hole HN-1 of the ORR on January 16, 1967, after 325 hours of satisfactory pre-irradiation test operation. Pre-irradiation operation included complete removal and replacement of an original flush charge of solvent salt, providing a good demonstration of the operability of the sampling and addition system.

Operation in the fully inserted, highest flux position was achieved on February 21, 1967, and has since been maintained. The average flux effective in all the salt is estimated to be slightly above 1x 10^13. The total fission heat generation is about 9 kW with a gamma heat of about 4 kW; the system heat generation is about 13 kW. The loop is operating satisfactorily.

Sampling and addition systems have operated reliably and without difficulty in all cases. It is anticipated that additional samples will be taken, and fuel and solvent salt additions made from time to time during the course of the experiment.

The breeder reactor design has been considerably narrowed in scope during this period. A modular concept has been adopted as the basic design, and our effort has been concentrated on more clearly defining the features of one 250-MW (electrical) module. No work has been done on the overall plant design during this period, and no attention has been given to the steam system.

With minor exceptions, all design effort has been concerned with components and layout within the reactor cell. A layout was made of the drain tanks with interconnecting piping for a satisfactory solution to this question, which will not be overly difficult.

Again, in order to get a preliminary evaluation of the nature of the communication problem between the reactor plant and the chemical processing plant, one method of effecting this interconnection was developed. Basically, this plan involves a batch transfer between plants, the batches being moved between the two plants by gas pressure. Transfer to and from the chemical plant is in control of the reactor plant operator. Although the system of communication between the reactor and chemical plant has not been worked out in any detail, it appears that the communication scheme can be done with certainty and safety.

Detailing of the design: A basic concept of fuel cell, blanket, plenum chambers, and reflector thickness for a reactor with an average power density of approximately 40 kW/liter has reached a firm status. It is this module that will receive detailed attention. For comparison purposes, a module of equal power but having twice the average power density was calculated. Table 9. 1 shows the comparison between these two reactors regarding performance and economy.

The blanket and fuel heat exchangers are also considered to be in a sufficiently firm design to justify detailing of these components. Both heat exchangers have undergone significant changes in physical arrangement and will be discussed in some detail later.

The arrangement of components in the reactor cell, as previously reported, posed some very difficult stress problems. A new arrangement of these components appears to have removed or greatly lessened these problems. Analyses are currently in progress, which will indicate whether or not further changes are required.

Operational experience with the MSRE has indicated clearly that the handling of fission gases from a molten-salt reactor requires very careful design. The gas system for the breeder reactor is a most important part of the plant, and a start has been made in the design of this system. A flowsheet which seems to describe this system has been developed. Also, analytical studies of gas stripping efficiencies and parameters which determine or define the nature of the gas sparging system have been initiated.

Associated with the gas handling problem is the matter of draining the reactor in the event of a pump stoppage. Modifications in the primary heat exchanger, indicated by the sparge gas handling and core drainage, influenced us to put an overflow line from the sump tank of the pump into a fuel dump tank.

It will be noted that the maximum coolant-salt pressure is somewhat higher than has been reported previously. This pressure occurs at the discharge of the coolant pump, and of the 260 psi at this point, 110 psi comes from a gas overpressure at the suction side of the coolant.

We believe it to be imperative that, in the event of a failure in any part of the salt systems, the pressures should be such that blanket salt would flow into fuel salt, and coolant salt would flow into blanket and fuel salt, depending on the location of the failure. This made it necessary.

In previous flowsheets, a separate coolant pump circulated salt through the reheater. We now bypass the discharge of the main coolant pump through a salt-flow regulating valve to the reheater. This valve is little more than a variable orifice, and we believe in the use of such a valve.

Because of the relatively high melting point of the blanket salt, it is desirable to connect the coolant circuits of the fuel heat exchanger and the blanket heat exchanger in series. The coolant-salt line, carrying 37. 5 ft³/sec, is a large pipe (~20 in. in diameter) and therefore rigidly connects these two heat exchangers.

In the original layout of the reactor cell, which had the reactor, fuel heat exchanger, and blanket heat exchanger in a triangular array, a twisting moment resulted about the axis of the fuel connection between the reactor and the fuel heat exchanger. Additionally, the method of suspension mounting of the heat exchangers from constant load cells could not provide accommodation for the differential thermal expansion of the system under all conditions.

A new layout of the reactor cell shown in Figure 3 was made. In this configuration, the three components - reactor, fuel heat exchanger, and blanket heat exchanger - are mounted in line. The coolant lines connecting the fuel and the blanket exchanger are made concentric, and the shortest possible spacing between exchangers is used. The connection from the fuel heat exchanger to the reactor is as short as possible, using concentric piping for this as we have been doing previously.

To blanket exchangers are run independently. These lines are purposely made long and flexible by running them through four 90° bends. Thus, we intend to decouple the interconnection between the reactor and the blanket heat exchanger by the use of flexible piping.

The three components, reactor, fuel exchanger, and blanket exchanger, are rigidly interconnected then by only one link for each. The reactor connects by the concentric fuel line to the fuel exchanger, which connects by one concentric coolant line to the blanket exchanger. At design point, these connecting lines are very near the ambient cell temperature of 1000°F. The fuel line is actually at 1000°F, and the coolant line is very near 850°F. With the three cell components in line, a different plan of support is now proposed. Let us point out that this arrangement has not yet been analyzed for stresses, so we cannot be sure it is satisfactory in its.

The plan now involves mounting a stainless steel bed plate in the reactor cell in such a way as to be tied at one end but free to expand with cell temperature. This bed plate is located horizontally below the bottom of the reactor vessel and is mounted through necessary insulated supports to the load-bearing concrete of the cell. The reactor vessel and both heat exchangers are mounted rigidly to the plate as shown in Fig. 4. We believe that this general arrangement will work and that any overstressing found by analysis of the system can be corrected without departing drastically from the concept.

Vertical growth of all components can take place independently, and the only accommodation needed is a low-temperature sealing bellows at each pump-drive penetration through the cell membrane. Any control-rod drive mechanism would involve a similar bellows seal.

The treatment of the reactor cell has not received any attention, but it is certain that some form of radiation shield must cover the structural concrete, and this shield must have cooling. Inside the radiation shield, between it and the furnace of the cell, there must be some thermal.

The reactor is shown in the elevation drawing of 0. 5. The reactor vessel has a cylindrical body 12 ft in diameter and approximately 17 ft high with dished heads on top and bottom. A heavy supporting ring, essentially the diameter of the core, carries legs which weld to the bed plate and provide the mechanical mounting for the vessel. From the center of the bottom head, a concentric fuel line communicates with the fuel heat exchanger. This fuel line flows in these lines at a rate of approximately 18 fps.

Inside the reactor vessel are dished heads forming plenum chambers for distribution of the fuel cells, which rise from these heads. These plenum chambers are removable from the reactor vessel, being held in place by a flanged mounting ring equipped with clamps. This flange has not been completely designed, but we are considering the use of flat graphite gaskets to prevent bonding of the flange surfaces under the high temperature and rather high loading pressure obtained at design conditions. The inner head communicates with the inner concentric line through a slip joint, which permits movement of the head relative to the pipe. Such movement results from thermal expansion and must be accommodated. In addition, the slip joint allows removal of the core when the flange seal is broken.

The core of the reactor is made up of 336 cylindrical graphite fuel cells mounted as close together as tolerances permit to form essentially a cylindrical array approximately 8.3 ft in diameter. The graphite cells are extruded cylinders with center holes 14 inches in diameter, surrounded at 120° angles with three 1-inch-diameter holes. At the top of each cell, there is a graphite cap machined to provide a smooth communication between the four holes.

At the bottom of a cell, the graphite cylinder is joined to a transition nipple. This joining is done by a combination of a short threaded engagement for mechanical attachment and a rather longer brazed joint for leak-tightness. The connection to this nipple is a matter of development, and work is proceeding to establish the best practice for effecting this connection. The lower end of the nipple is threaded to screw into tapped holes in the upper.

As a fuel cell is put into place, the 14-inch center hole is slipped over the inner nipple. This engagement is a slip joint and allows for screwing the cell into place, and in operation, it permits the necessary differential expansion between the cell and the inner nipple. After all cells are in place, the entire core can be leak-tested, the graphite-to-metal transition joints having previously been tested individually. When the assembled core has been tested, it can be lowered into the reactor vessel, and the flanged joint can be clamped.

Just inside the reactor vessel, there is a graphite reflector 6 inches thick. This reflector is only on the vertical walls; there is none below or above the core. It is made of rectangular-shaped pieces with mortised joints to form a self-supporting wall resting on a ledge at the bottom of the vessel. The volume between the reflector and the vessel provides a flow passage for the blanket salt as it discharges through holes in the bottom of the distribution ring located near the top of the vessel.

We are considering the use of 4-inch-diameter graphite balls in the region between the core and the reflector. These balls have holes in them so that graphite occupies 40% of the volume in this 1%-ft-thick region. A retainer of perforated metal prevents the balls, which float in the blanket salt, from crowding into the top head of the reactor vessel. Instead, by floating up against this retainer, a measure of support is afforded to the core structure, the floating balls tending to exert a considerable force on the fuel cells.

With this core configuration, a two-fluid reactor is achieved. Fuel salt enters the outer concentric pipe at the bottom of the reactor. It flows out to the outer radius of the core and in between the upper inner dished heads, feeding salt into the nipples emerging from the upper head. Fuel passes up through the three 7-inch holes of each fuel cell and down through the center 1-inch hole through the inner pipe nipple into the collecting plenum. From there, it flows through the slip joint into the inner concentric fuel line to the pump suction at the center of the fuel heat exchanger.

The blanket salt flows into a distributor at the top of the reactor and emerges through holes in the bottom of this header. It flows behind the graphite reflector to the bottom of the reactor, where it then flows up through the balls in the blanket annulus and out of the suction.

The center location for a fuel cell is left vacant; this is for a control rod. In this control rod, it is represented as a hollow graphite cylinder 5 in. in outside diameter, 4 in. in inside diameter, and equipped with a gas inlet at the top. By controlling the gas pressure, blanket salt can be positioned at any height within this cylinder, and this blanket volume controls the reactivity of the core. Calculations indicate a change of 1.8% in reactivity between the full and empty condition of this cylinder.

It may be that, instead of a hollow cylinder, a graphite rod 5 in. or less in diameter will be used to displace blanket salt from this position in the core. Effective control can be obtained by driving this rod in a more conventional way. In the event of failure of the drive, the rod would be lifted out of the core by the more dense blanket; thereby reducing the reactivity.

The reactor has been optimized as far as nuclear performance is concerned. There is no very sensitive parameter, and rather large changes in all dimensions can be tolerated without changing the characteristics materially. Table 9. 1 gives the calculated performance of this reactor. This core volume is 503 ft³, with a fuel volume in the core of 83 ft³. This gives an average power density in the core of 39 kW/liter.

In Table 9.2, this reactor has half the volume in the core and would give somewhat better performance. At present, we do not know just what the limit is on graphite radiation tolerance. The smaller reactor, whatever the graphite limit, would be expected to have approximately half the core life of the larger one, which is used as the reference design.

Some general comments can be made about the reactor as it is currently conceived. As we stated above, the nuclear performance is so insensitive to parameters that the final reactor design is likely to be close to the present concept. We would prefer to have the core removable in modules rather than having to remove it in one piece. This is particularly desirable if we have to maintain the lower power density and if it becomes desirable to make reactor modules larger than the 556-MW (thermal) size with which we are concerned at present. We do not yet have what we consider an acceptable way of making these core submodules, but work is continuing to try to develop one.

The top of the reactor, as shown, has a welded joint which can be ground off for removal and re-welded when a new core has been installed. Probably, this access joint will be moved up outside, at least one layer of shielding in the final core design. The closure point for the reactor would, by this means, be more accessible.

This was made necessary by the results obtained from the MSRE. It was found that the salt thermal conductivity was less by about a factor of 3 than the value used in the original heat transfer calculations. This difference resulted in degradation of the overall heat transfer coefficient, necessitating an increase in heat transfer surface of the heat exchanger of approximately 20%. A new heat exchanger design with a larger number of tubes and a slight change in the baffle arrangement was developed.

A significant change in the heat exchanger design concerns the method of flanging the heat exchanger into the coolant circuit piping. In this arrangement, the toroidal coolant header is replaced by a jacket around the tubes. Figure 9. 7 shows the arrangement of this new heat exchanger.

After traversing the outside of the fuel tubes in a countercurrent flow pattern, the coolant salt leaves the heat exchanger through a central discharge pipe which connects to the center of the concentric coolant-salt line through a slip joint. The entire heat exchanger can be removed from the circuit by opening the large flange, cutting the large fuel pipe communicating with the reactor, and disengaging the center fuel pipe by slipping it out of the slip joint provided for this purpose. The drain and overflow lines and auxiliary pump lines must also be cut to remove the exchanger.

Because of the expansion of the fuel tubes, the toroidal header at the bottom of the exchanger will move relative to the vessel enclosing the exchanger. For this reason, and also to permit removal of the exchanger, a drain line cannot be connected to this header. Instead, a dip line for draining fuel extends into this header from the top of the exchanger. This line connects through a freeze valve to the fuel drain tanks for the reactor. When the drain valve is thawed and the drain tank is vented, the fuel salt in the heat exchanger flows through this line into the drain tank. The gas pressure in the pump bowl is sufficient to effect a complete drain of the fuel salt from the system.

In case of a pump stoppage with the attendant necessity to drain the reactor, the following sequence takes place. Upon pump stoppage, the reactor automatically drains into the pump sump. Automatic drainage takes place in the order of a few seconds. However, the concentric lines to the reactor and the headspace above the fuel tubes in the heat exchanger remain full of salt and will overheat if not cooled.

Stored gas will flow into the bottom of the heat exchanger, displacing the fuel into the pump sump from which it overflows into the drain tank. By properly sizing this tank, enough fuel can be displaced from the heat exchanger to bring the level at equilibrium below the top tube sheet of the exchanger. The lines and volumes above the tube sheets will be empty of salt, and no overheating will result.

We have calculated the cooling required for fuel in the tubes of the heat exchanger under stagnant conditions. Because of the geometry of the coolant salt system, there is convective flow of coolant salt even when no coolant pump is running.

The large sump tank on top of the heat exchanger is not intended to hold the drained fuel from the reactor. Because of the undesirability of installing the afterheat cooling system in the reactor cell and also to be able to drain the lines to the reactor, an overflow pipe was installed from the sump tank to a separate dump tank. This tank is equipped with a cooling system adequate for afterheat removal.

The sump tank on top of the heat exchanger appears to be larger than necessary, inasmuch as excess fuel flows through the 5-in. drain line to the drain tank. The size of the tank is dictated by the fact that it must hold the reactor volume (83 ft3) upon starting the reactor. Fuel cannot be forced by gas pressure out of the drain tank fast enough to keep the fuel pump primed on startup. The fuel must be displaced into the sump tank and held there by gas overpressure in the drain tank until the reactor is filled by the action of the pump.

Not shown in the drawing of the heat exchanger is the gas separator and associated apparatus for handling the sparge gas for the fuel system. The plans for handling this gas are being worked out, and drawings of the equipment are not yet ready.

The blanket heat exchanger is shown in Fig. 8. There is no need for the gas sparge system, and there is no afterheat problem that has to be provided for here. In addition, the coolant flow is less complicated since counterflow is unnecessary. The temperature difference is modest between the blanket salt and coolant, and the total rise in temperature is only 11°F as the coolant passes through.

Figure 9. 9 shows the geometry of a cell in the graphite-moderated core. Graphite dowels of appropriate size are located at the six corners of the cell to yield the desired fertile salt volume fraction. The cell calculations were performed with the code TONG and involved varying (1) cell diameter, (2) fuel distribution (fuel separation distance, s), (3) U-74 concentration, (4) Th-3 concentration, (5) fuel volume fraction, and (6) fertile volume fraction. Each of these parameters was varied separately while holding the others constant.

Not adversely affected, the use of a 5-inch cell may, for example, permit a reduction of the 754U inventory. Pending further study, case 3 (which differs from case 1 only in cell size) is considered to represent the current cell dimensions used in the design.

9. 5 shows the ratio of the average flux in the fuel to the cell average flux, the ratio of the average flux in the graphite to the cell average flux, and the ratio of the average flux in the fertile salt to the cell average flux for the epithermal and fast flux ranges. Figure 9. 11 shows the thermal flux distribution in the cell. The results in 9. 11 are based upon an annular approximation to the cell of 9.

The two-dimensional calculations used the 5-in. diameter cell composition and cross-section distribution in the core midplane for neutron energy groups 1 and 6 separately, and Figure 13 shows the total flux distribution. The radial peak-to-average flux ratio in the graphite-moderated part and axial peak-to-average flux ratio in the graphite-moderated core region is 1.51.

The gas handling system for the MSBR serves several functions in the operation of the plant. These include: supplying helium for purging and pressurization of the gas spaces, rapidly removing Xe from the salt, transporting, removing, and storing the radioactive fission product gases, and processing the helium for recycle into the gas supply or disposal to the atmosphere. A scheme for accomplishing these functions is described below.

Preliminary studies of the migration of 135Xe to the graphite in molten-salt breeder reactors indicated that it would be possible to reduce the 135Xe poison fraction to an acceptable value if a gas-stripping system could be devised, which would process the entire reactor fuel-salt inventory in about 30 seconds. Since the reactor system salt circuit time is about 9 seconds, it is required that the entire inventory be processed every 3 to 4 passes around the circuit.

20% of the total 135Xe produced in the fissioning of 233U appears directly, and very high processing rates would be required to obtain even modest gains. For example, if the entire fuel inventory were processed for Xe removal once every hour, the xenon removal process rate would reduce processing time to only about 110 sec. Therefore, processing for iodine is not, at this time, being considered as a method of removing 135Xe.

The method proposed for the removal of Xenon-5 involves stripping of xenon-enriched helium bubbles from the fuel stream by means of a gas separator located at the heat exchanger outlet. The bubbles will be generated by injecting helium into the salt at the fuel pump suction, and transfer of xenon from the salt to the gas will be effected during passage through the heat exchanger.

The flowsheet for the MSBR off-gas system is given in Fig. 16. Helium is injected into the suction of the fuel salt pump and is removed by centrifugal separation at the heat exchanger outlet. The liquid-gas mixture from the separator is then fed into a cyclone separator where the entrained liquid is removed and returned to the pump bowl. The gas from the pump shaft purge and the instrument lines is combined with that from the cyclone separator and fed into the 48-hr xenon holdup system. The remainder of the gas from the 48-hr xenon holdup system is fed into the gas injector system at the fuel pump suction. It is the salt-powered gas injector that serves as the prime mover for the high-gas-flow recycle system. Some of the design criteria of the critical components are described below.

The location and manner of gas injection shall provide a balanced distribution of bubbles in the liquid entering the pump impeller. This consideration affects the bubble distribution in the heat exchanger and the bubble size, as well as the pump dynamic balance.

The supply for the gas injector shall be taken from the outlet line from the 48-hr xenon holdup helium recirculation system. There shall be a backflow preventer arrangement at this gas supply point to prevent salt from getting back into the charcoal beds as a result of a sudden pressure transient in either the salt or gas system.

The separator, including the entrance region, shall be kept as short as is reasonably possible, and the separator shall be as close to the heat exchanger as good design permits.

The design of the system shall include assurance that the separator will not admit gas into the salt line to the reactor except when the fuel pump stops. Check valves or liquid submersion of the discharge will not be used to prevent backflow, since the reactor drain scheme will use the separator outlet as a gas source.

Since there will be a total of more than a kilogram of fission products produced each day in the reactor complex, and since a sizable fraction is involved in the short-lived gaseous products, a method of collecting, cooling, and conveying to a disposal area must be included. The collecting device should pass only gas that has resided in the volume holdup for at least the specified minimum transit time.

A close-coupled facility for processing the fuel and fertile streams of a molten-salt breeder reactor (MSBR) will be an integral part of the reactor system. Studies are in progress for obtaining data relevant to the engineering design of such a processing facility.

The fuel processing plant will operate on a side stream withdrawn from the fuel stream, which circulates through the reactor core and primary heat exchanger. For a 1000-MW (electrical) MSBR, approximately 14. 1 ft of salt will be processed per day, resulting in a fuel-salt cycle time of approximately 40 days. The presently envisioned process has been described previously. The significant process steps are the recovery of the uranium by continuous fluorination, recovery of the carrier fuel salt by vacuum distillation, and recombination of the purified UF₆ and barren car.

Uranium present in the fuel stream of an MSBR must be removed prior to the distillation step since UF6 present in the still would not be completely volatilized and would, in part, be discharged to waste in material rejected from the distillation system. The equipment will be protected from corrosion by freezing a layer of salt on the vessel wall; the heat necessary for maintaining molten salt adjacent to frozen salt will be provided by the decay of fission products in the fuel stream. Present development work consists of two parts: (1) studies in a continuous fluorinator not protected by a frozen wall and (2) study of a frozen-wall system which is suitable for continuous fluorination but with an inert gas substituted for fluorine in the experiments. Work on the two systems is described in the following.

The experimental system has been described previously and consists of a 1-inch-diameter fluorinator 72 inches long and auxiliary equipment, which allows the countercurrent contact of a molten salt with F2. It is intended to demonstrate the effectiveness of this type of system for uranium recovery and to obtain engineering design data on backmixing and F2 utilization. The present work has used salt containing no beryllium, but LiF-BeF2 mixtures will be used when suitable facilities for handling beryllium are made available.

This system also allows development of techniques and auxiliaries required for continuous fluorinators. These include means for controlling and measuring molten-salt flow rates, and methods for sampling and analyzing molten-salt streams and gas streams. A gas chromatograph is used for analysis of the fluorinator off-gas for UF6, F2, and N2. Uranium concentration in the salt during fluorination is determined from salt samples taken at 15-minute intervals.

Data obtained from this system has been reported previously. Three additional experiments have been made at 600°C using an NaF-LiF-ZrF mixture containing 0.37 to 1.16 wt% UF6 and having a melting point of ~475°C. Salt feed rates of 9.8 to 30 cm/min and F2 rates of 235 to 335 cm3/min (STP) have been used with molten-salt depths of ~48 in. Uranium removal during.

During the best run to date, a molten-salt feed rate of 10. 2 cm/min and an F2 feed rate were removed by the fluorinator, as determined from inlet and exit concentrations of uranium in the salt. Later in the run, a molten-salt feed rate of 22.5 cm³/min and an F2 rate of 270 cm/min (STP) were maintained for a 2.5-hr period.

Components for the protected system have been fabricated and are being installed. This system will be operated with a frozen layer of salt on the fluorinator wall and will allow the countercurrent contact of an inert gas with molten salt in equipment suitable for continuous operations.

The fluorinator is constructed from 5-in. diam sched-40 nickel pipe and will provide a section protected by a frozen wall ~6 ft high. Internal heat generation is provided by Calrod heaters placed inside a 1/2-in. diam nickel tube along the centerline of the vessel. The frozen-wall thickness will be dependent on the radial heat flux and can be varied from % to 1% in. Frozen-wall thermocouples located at different radii with respect to the vessel centerline.

Relative volatilities of several rare-earth fluorides with respect to lithium fluoride have been measured in an equilibrium still operated at 1000°C and 0. 50 mm Hg pressure. Recent work has refined previously reported values for CeF2, LaF3, and NdF3, and has added the relative volatility for SmF3. The rate of vaporization of LiF has been measured at 1000°C at several pressures. These data are useful in estimating the probable error in measured relative volatilities and for predicting vaporization rates in equipment suitable for MSBR processing. The results of a study on the buildup of materials of low volatility at a surface where vaporization is occurring are also.

A distillation step will be used in the MSBR processing plant to remove rare-earth fission products from the fuel stream. To design the still, it is necessary to know the relative volatilities of the rare-earth fluorides with respect to LiF, the major constituent of the still pot. The equilibrium still used for these measurements and the operating procedure have been previously described. 50 mm Hg have been obtained from recent experiments and are listed below.

Data on the variation of vaporization rate with total pressure are necessary to assess the error in relative volatilities measured in the recirculating equilibrium still and to predict vaporization rates in equipment suitable for MSBR processing. A diagram of the equipment used for the left leg of the still, and the condensate was collected in a similar crucible in the right leg.

For the operation of the still, a mixture of LiF and a rare-earth trifluoride having a known composition was placed in a crucible in the vaporizing section of the still, and a second crucible was placed below the condenser. The system was purged with argon while being heated to the desired temperature. When the temperature in the vaporizing section reached 1000°C, the still pressure was decreased to the desired value, and the condenser cooling air was turned on. The condenser temperature of about 500°C caused the salt vapor to solidify on the condenser walls. After a given length of time, the still was pressurized with argon and the cooling air turned off. This allowed the condensate to melt and drain into the crucible below the condenser. Results of these tests are given in Table 10. 1.

At pressures near the vapor pressure of LiF, the LiF vaporization rate increased slowly as the pressure was lowered. At a pressure significantly lower than the LiF vapor pressure, the rate increased by an order of magnitude. The measured rate at 1.0 mm Hg was comparable with the rate calculated by assuming the rate to be diffusion-controlled. Since these data indicate that an error in the measured relative volatilities could arise because of differences in the rates of diffusion of LiF and REF vapor. Calculations indicate that the error in the relative volatility from this source is only about 1% and that other effects, such as a nonuniform concentration gradient in the liquid, are much more important.

During the vaporization of a multicomponent mixture, materials less volatile than the bulk of the mixture tend to remain in the liquid phase and are removed from the liquid surface by the processes of convection and molecular diffusion. Low-pressure vaporization does not generate deeply submerged bubbles and therefore provides little convective mixing in the liquid. An appreciable variation in the concentration of materials of low volatility may occur if these materials are removed by diffusion only.

Consider as an exemplary case a continuous still of the type shown in Fig. 2. Fuel carrier salt (LiF-BeF2) containing fission product fluorides is fed to the bottom of the system continuously. Most of the LiF-BeF2 fed to the system is vaporized, and a salt stream containing most of the nonvolatile materials is withdrawn continuously. The positive x-direction will be taken as vertically upward, and the liquid withdrawal point and the liquid surface will be located at x = 0 and x = 1, respectively. At the surface, a fraction v/V of the LiF vaporizes, and the remaining LiF is returned to the bottom of the still.

"Experimental equipment has been designed for an engineering-scale demonstration of vacuum distillation of molten-salt reactor fuel. The distillation will be carried out at about 1000°C and 1 mm Hg pressure to separate LiF-BeF₂ carrier salt from less volatile fission products, primarily the rare earths. Uranium tetrafluoride will not be present during distillation, having been previously removed by fluorination. ".

This experiment is part of a program to develop all unit operations in the processing of a molten-salt breeder reactor fuel. Vacuum distillation is the key step in the process because it recovers the bulk of the valuable LiF-BeF2 carrier, decontaminated from fission products, for recycle to the reactor. Feasibility of distilling fluoride salts was established in batch laboratory experiments by Kelly. The present experiment will demonstrate the operation on an engineering scale and furnish data on the relative volatilities of the components of the mixture.

In the interest of simplicity, fabrication time, and economy, no attempt is being made in this experiment to reproduce actual MSBR operating conditions, such as high internal heat generation rate in the still volume or the design of a still that can serve in a processing plant for a breeder. Such advances are the next logical step after an engineering-scale demonstration. However, it is the purpose of this experiment to show that molten salt containing fission products can be fed continuously to the still at the same rate at which it is being distilled, with the simultaneous accumulation of fission products in the bottoms. The still can also be operated batchwise to concentrate fission products in some small fraction of the original charge.

The experimental program is in two parts: About 90% of the time will be devoted to nonradioactive operation, and the remaining 10% to radioactive operation in distilling a small quantity of fuel from the MSRE. The first phase is expected to log 500 to 1000 hours of operation. The same equipment is to be used in the radioactive experiment after being thoroughly inspected at the conclusion of nonradioactive operation. Radioactive runs will be carried out in an MSRE cell.

Components of the experiment are a feed tank (48 liters), still (12 liters), condenser, condensate receiver (48 liters), associated temperature and pressure instrumentation, and vacuum system. The still, condenser, and receiver are fabricated as a unit. The vessels are mounted in an angle-iron frame, which is 3 x 6 x 7 ft high, allowing transport of the entire facility as a unit once instrumentation, power, and service lines have been disconnected. Each process piece is surrounded on all sides by shell-type electric heaters. These, in turn, are enclosed in 4 to 8 in. of thermal insulation. A diagram of the assembly, which shows the feed and sampling mechanisms, is shown in Fig. 5.

An experiment is carried out by charging a molten mixture of carrier salt and fission product fluorides into the feed tank, which is held at a temperature slightly above the melting point. In most cases, this is 500 to 550°C. Concurrently, the still, condenser, and condensate receiver are heated and evacuated, and the space above the liquid in the feed tank is evacuated.

The still pot is the highest point of the system and is an annular volume surrounding the top of the condenser. Freezing is prevented by supplying the necessary external heat to keep the condenser surface above the liquidus temperature. In leaving the condenser, the distillate passes through a small cup from which samples can be removed for analysis.

Liquid-level instrumentation in the still allows control of feed rate to correspond to the distillation rate, which is estimated to be 400 to 500 cm of distillate per hour. Determining the actual distillation rate for molten-salt systems is an important part of this experiment.

All vessels and lines that contact molten salt are fabricated of Hastelloy N. In the region of the still and upper section of the condenser, the normal use temperature for this alloy may be exceeded by as much as 200°C. Consequently, the vessels are to be examined thoroughly by dimensional, radiographic, and ultrasonic methods before and after non-radioactive operation.
